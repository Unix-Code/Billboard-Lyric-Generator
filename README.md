# Bumpify
Bumpify is an AI for generating rap lyrics, using a recurrent neural network model which has learned from the lyrics to Billboard hits in the "Hip-hop/R&B" category from 2016-2018. Generate your own hit song with the touch of a button!


Bumpify was created using Python, Flask, and several Python libraries we found online:

https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts -- for scraping Billboard chart data

https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius -- for gathering lyrics using the Genius API

https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow -- for training an AI to produce similar lyrics
