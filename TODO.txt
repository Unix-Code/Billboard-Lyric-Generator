TODO:

- make a title generator (based on lines from the hook, can be incorporated with structure method)
- make a GUI
- organize song_structure.py better
- remove stray parentheses
- redo line break generator -- deliminate lines by commas first, then break them apart if too long or append them if too short
- remove commas after using them for line breaks?
