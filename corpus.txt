Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time

Only time I feel pain, when I'm feelin' love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only time I'm in my mind, when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really alone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feeling really lost, ducking all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, gettin' caught in traffic, traffic


Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and don't go

Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind

Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Nigga really wanna die in the night time

Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

And put my number in it..
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

Rhino Tank God
Ayy, ayy

There's a few things that I wanna say
To the game company named Rockstar (-star, ayy)
I've been playing GTA since '98
So I've been down with you lot right from the start (the start)
When running over Hare Krishnas
Was rewarded with the sound "Gouranga!" (-ranga)
I learnt swearing thanks to you, if I hadn't
I'd still be saying "Gosh, darn" (gosh darn, , ayy, ayy)

Played the story mode of GTA V
Every day, all summer, got far (got far, ayy)
Then it glitched, I lost my progress, I was pissed
Had a face like a slapped arse (slapped arse, ayy)
Plus quit GTA Online 'cause hackers got free stuff
For which I got charged (got charged, ayy)
Wasted every penny of my money
On a Megalodon shark card (shark card)

There's some more stuff that I wanna say
To the game company named Rockstar (-star, ayy, ayy)
How come you don't bother using the face engine
You used in LA Noire? (-A Noire)
It was such a cool way to incorporate the faces
Of real actors (actors)
Their expressions were as entertaining
As when Jack Thompson got disbarred
He was so annoying, blaming all the violence on games
Saying GTA was the way murderers had been trained
Saying "I want it banned" (ayy, ayy)
Kind of like how you never made a PC Red Dead Redemption
And even despite the undeniable demand
You're disappointing the fans (yeah, ayy)

One final thing that I want to say
To the game company named Rockstar (-star)
Why you never made another Grand Theft Auto
That is set in London? (London)
Now you're based in New York, you forgot your humble roots
In Edinburgh (-burgh)
Or Dundee, I couldn't tell from my research
But definitely in Scotland (Scotland)

Is it bad that I just wanna hear a pedestrian
Shouting "tosser"? (tosser)
Swearing like a British person is at risk
Of becoming a lost art (lost art)
Wouldn't it be fun to hear the word "wanker"
More often in the pop charts? (pop charts)
That's currently the end of the list
Of things I want to say to Rockstar (-star)

I'm singing the same melody as before
But transposed by an octave (-ave)
(Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar)


Huh, Gucci
XO (yeah)
1-0 (yeah)
1-7 (yeah)
Brrr! Brrr! Go!


The kid back on the whiskey
Virginia Black got me tipsy
I'm in L.A. like I'm Nipsey
Spanish girls wanna kiss me
A nigga wanna come and diss me
And put a hex like a gypsy
They kill themselves, no wrist bleed
Got suicides on my SV
She do it all for the Fendi
She do it all for the Gucci (Gucci!)
Baby girl wanna choose me
She wanna use and abuse me
I know she wanna text me (wow)
I know she wanna sex me (damn)
50 thou' make her neck freeze
Fuck her once like "next, please" (brrr, brrr)
My nigga, who would've thought? (huh?)
My nigga, who would've thought now? (now)
I'll be right back at the top now
I'll be right back at the top now
I got your girl on my finger
Blowin' my phone like she's single
Blowin' my phone like I'm Cee-Lo (damn)
Somebody needs to come get her (like damn)

Like, "Woo!"
With the curve, with the curve
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it
I got that work (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I know you want the Birkin
Baby, are you worth it?
Like, "Woo!"
With the curve, with the curve
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it (don't deserve it)
I got that work (brrr)
I need to know for certain (it's Gucci!)
Tell me, are you worth it?


Say I, a star was born last night
Way you showed out on that dick, girl, you performed last night
That's why you deserve that first class flight
Bye bye, 'cause I just quenched your thirst last night
I'm in Dubai
Somebody tell the prince that the kingpin has arrived
If I lived over here, I'd prolly have one hundred wives (well damn)
Walkin' in the club and they like, "Gucci just arrived" (Gucci!)
I ordered up a dub and then I threw it in the sky
I told her I'm iight, now she look like she surprised (I'm iight)
She look like a model, but a devil in disguise
All these chains on me, I look like Dion in his prime
You know you came to fuck, so why the fuck we wastin' time?
I got the kind of wood that make a woman lose her mind
I'm young, rich and handsome, baby, I'm one of a kind
Just keep it real with me, baby, it won't cost you a dime (Gucci!)
I know you got expensive taste and I don't even mind

I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it
I got that work, got that work
I know you want the Birkin
Baby, are you worth it?
Like, "Woo!"
With the curve (with the curve, it's Gucci!)

In a whip so low, no one's gotta know
Knocking at your door, I don't gotta work anymore
You can put your phone out here girl, you need two hands
You can't get enough, girl, you know I set it up for after dark

Late night, like left eye
I'm creepin', assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is driving me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're ducking calls or missing calls 'cause
You've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changing
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way


In a whip so low, no one's gotta know (no one's gotta know)
Knocking at your door, I don't gotta work anymore (I don't gotta work no more)

You can't get enough, girl, you know I set it up for after dark


Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right, it's gon' be a long night (ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the shorty, we got drugs
And when it's time to duck it, we can go


In a whip so low, no one's gotta know (no one's gotta know)
Knocking at your door, I don't gotta work anymore (I don't gotta work no more)

His body dropped down to the floor and he had teardrops in his eyes

Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line (this is all)

Your family told you I'm a bad move
Plus I'm already a black dude
Leavin' the bathroom, my hands is half-rinsed
If only a nigga just had sense
Speaking in past tense
It's been a week and a half since
We ain't been speaking in mad mins
You feeling free in my absence
I've been going through a lot behind this glass tint (this is all, this is all)

Back of the coffee line
Back, back Back in the bathroom line (this is)
I know they told you I'd be bad for you

Don't worry I'll be back for you
All the money and cars
Stripper hoes and the tattoos
Bad news
Back off a coffee bean
Reflecting on all you see (this is all, this is all)

Stressing over award shows
She's stressin' over her wardrobe
Bought the mansion on foreclose
No matter how many tickets your tour sold
You feel this deep in your torso
Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope
Some shit only me and the Lord knows
SOS, that's for those who hear this in morse code
Too many doors closed Cul-de-sacs and foreign doors
Still ended meet up at the North Pole
This is where remorse goes
Shoulda had you in Divorce Court
Fighting over your seeds, writing over your D's, sliding over your keys
Alimony and fees, as your lawyer proceeds
To give out bad news

I'm just bad, bad news
Good thing, but you was right
The money and who?
It's bad news
Bad, bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean
Anything in between (this is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line (This is all)

As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon as you wear slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I won't miss it
The sky is fallling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipses eclipsin'
My Astronaut helmet kinda' shifted from the lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world baby we have been evicted


Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And If you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)


Open up the curtains
Wonder watching, people killing-robbing
The sky is falling, falling down
It turns into news and this is the apocalypse
People living on they rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stopping this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room, of I and you
Tell me will I see you soon
Meet you on the moon?


Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, falling down
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And If you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)


Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me

She dancin' in the strobe
Let's fuckin' spoil my night (spoil my night)
Spent so much cash, I lost her
My cup was too toxic
I took the robe off (yeah)
I couldn't get her off me
Dropped plenty money on her thighs
There's plenty room in my ride
I've never been like a small fry
She took me in, that's on my life

Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (my night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night

I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night? (spoil my night)
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time

Point her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me (bring her to me)
I ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies (wow)
And she see those diamonds in my teeth (in my teeth)

I got a story to tell
You know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved


I see niggas in this bitch, stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get 'em," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I say get him"
And they so pretty, and their hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'"
She say, "What's missin'? ", "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratch his head, she say, "Get back in bed"
And she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say-ooh

I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!"
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told ya"
She gave me the salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now think for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga

And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga
Mona


Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fuck, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(... lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do?
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge her
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself


She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah


Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call you
Tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story, everybody sings

And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me
Know that's when you crying

Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
(Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
(Fuck you, too)
Moving on to chokers, you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me
Know that's when you crying


Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby (Lil boat)
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
(Lil boat, Lil boat, Lil boat, Lil boat)


I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl I know I do
Try to search after the water not well
But I can't find a girl that looks close like you
I had made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone 'til I come home back to you
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house and laughed out on your avenue
Oh you can't front, you're a stone cold diva
I had to get counseling from my mom, she's a heartbreak teacher
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think 'bout you every single time I eat pizza


Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Why you holding me?

Get so much dope money nigga I ain't got time for livin'
And my big coupe but forgot the top
Made 100k like a 
In South Beach on Ocean Drive
I got goons with me and they bleed that five
Spent 500 on some Robin Jeans
Got a groupie bitch, she'll fuck team
Got three main, no 
Not turned up to the MAS
Spent 500 in LAX
 so free my ass

She say she like my Audemar
Beemer coupe, take off the top, baby no Mardi Gras
Standin' in this kush with all this cash on me
I got goons in this bitch with red rags on 'em
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down


Have you ever counted 200, 000?
Straight cash in a project house
And these school boys would know nothin' about it
FN on the Holy Bible
Paranoia won't take a shower
Spent 50 bands in a cool hour
I'll drop the top man word law
Sellin' dope, she knew double R
Smokin' kush blunts while I double cup
Louie belt hold the pants up
Duffle bag with that tan stuff
Got two spots rollin' like the blunt
But that Zone 3 what I represent
Red beam in my residence
Protect it up like the president
Say the wrong word and gone kill shit
MMG what I represent
125 where I live with
Still hand in hand with that white shit
Big bells and them clean bricks
Turn a regular bitch to a bad bitch
Drink a whole nine to half a brick
Turn a rental car to an M6
Nigga I been rich


She say she like my Audemar
Beemer coupe, take off the top, baby no Mardi Gras
Standin' in this kush with all this cash on me
I got goons in this bitch with red rags on 'em
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down

Don't let strangers in
Twist your fingers in
Gangsters shit begin
Used to get in and kickin' the doors and now I want the back end

Waking them up with a text, say "hoe, let your day begin"

She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies

Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart

And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So if I think I’m ready to jump out the window

I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check
You, you cried on my phone the whole night that time he crossed the line, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I was there
I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah

The question isn't "Do he love ya?"
The question is "Do ya love yourself?"
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess
Way back then we the best thing that never happened, but

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So if I think I'm ready to jump out the window

You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation?
What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation,
You need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill.
Look

Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needing clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity
Hear me

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So, yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

I don't mean to sound like the jealous type but you oughta know, oughta know
I think me and you should get together sometimes on the low, low, low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know

I don't mean to sound like the jealous type but you oughta know, oughta know
I think me and you should get together sometimes on the low, low, low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth I gotta know

I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend
This one's for you, you, you, you

They gave a bitch two options: stripping or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get in Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in them shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm dripping in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from making tuna sandwiches to making the news
I started speaking my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs

Get money, go hard, you're motherfucking right
Never been no fraud in my motherfucking life
Get money, go hard, damn fucking right
Stunt on these bitches out of motherfucking spite
Ain't no running up on me, went from nothing to glory
I ain't telling ya to do it, I'm just telling my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, ya ain't gotta support me

I went from rag to riches, went from way too lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smiling in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climb to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said "I was just trying to chill and make bangers"
Tell all these old bitches they in danger
The thing on my hip whip bitches in to shape
That's what I call a fucking waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what?
I think ya got your story screwed up
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough

I'm the one who's killing shit, hands down
If you got a problem with me, say it now
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissing
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on the go like I don't see no stop lights
I'm stepping out every day, prom night
So if it's all love, show me love then
'Cause you hating on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie low, that's how I'm pulling up
Just 'cause I been on the road, don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun

And we all know you ain't that tight
I smack you and the bitch that you act like
I started getting money, bitches upset
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced
Come through shinning with them Rollies bust face
Headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitches feeling like this since 08'
I don't trust no nigga, I don't feel no bitch
Whole life been through some fucked up shit
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you seen what I've seen, you end up like this

I walked into the label, "where the check at?"
Cardi B on the charts, you can expect that
Where that bitch that was claiming she a threat?
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild
I'm Chyna wit' the porn like a bad ass child
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that "blap" sound (Blap!)

Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten
Yeah, but I get up ten
Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten
Bitch

Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy

All this old talk left me confused
You'd rather be old rich me or new you?
And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new
Like 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh


Nobody wins when the family feuds
But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute..
Pretty much
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us
Fuck rap, crack cocaine
Nah, we did that, Black-owned things
Hundred percent, Black-owned champagne
And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams
Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, huh
But we ain't get through to you yet, uh
What's better than one billionaire? Two (two)
'Specially if they're from the same hue as you
Y'all stop me when I stop tellin' the truth

I would say I'm the realest nigga rappin'
But that ain't even a statement
That's like sayin' I'm the tallest midget
Wait, that ain't politically correct
Forget it
Can I get "Amen" from the congregation?
Amen, amen
Can I get a "Amen" from the congregation?
Amen, amen


Yeah, I'll fuck up a good thing if you let me
Let me alone, Becky
A man that don't take care his family can't be rich
I'll watch Godfather, I miss that whole shit
My consciousness was Michael's common sense
I missed the karma and that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'
Kay losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain
Nobody wins when the family feuds
We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools
I'm tryna fix you
I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official
Y'all think small, I think Biggie
Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies
How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me?
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis
We all lose when the family feuds
What's better than one billionaire? Two
I'll be damned if I drink some Belvedere while Puff got CÎROC
Y'all need to stop


Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher
Love me like, love
Higher
Like... yeah, yeah, yeah...

No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh
Yeah

Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on making the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take them to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of c-notes get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's Rose
Two girls that I rope like I'm Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all up on a Nipsey hood and go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tried to change the energy with stones and crystals
But it's gonna take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doing numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves

No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh

Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese
You don't want drama, capisce?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talking and commas increase
I'm standing at the top of where you niggas are climbing to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, Gs
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's asking what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walking backwards
Like Charlemagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal man
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doing dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link back on the 33rd
When I say that they cursing me, it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protecting me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna' pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh

Look
I just want to break up all your shit
Call your mama phone, let her know that she raised a bitch
Then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around acting like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'gram?
Little bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holding back everything that's inside of me
How you all fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
(You sleeping, you sleeping, you sleeping)
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
(You creeping, you creeping, you creeping)

I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh

All I can see is you and her in different scenarios
Beyoncé on my stereo, resentment on repeat
I'mma make a bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, "Here you go, nigga, bon appétit"
Look did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no bad bitches
This shit is eating me, you sleeping peacefully
Getting more mad at you, thinking 'bout stabbing you
Don't even know that you this close to dying
You gon' wake up like, "Why you got an attitude?"

My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
(You sleeping, you sleeping, you sleeping)
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
(You creeping, you creeping, you creeping)

I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh

It's killing me
It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh
It's killing me
It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh
It's killing me
It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh
It's killing me

I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh

But I'm a north Vallejo nigga, and I'm heavy in the streets
I was raised by my grannie and the gangsters
So at 8 I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and

Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night meet the light
Turn to day
Can't stop, yeah, you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night meets the light
Turn to day

Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on
Needin' it all right now when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong
Whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on your door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain, I'm stayin' so high
Put the lighter all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free your mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I catch you blow the whistle when you run out of time
Yeah, wakin' up I open up my... eyes
Do you mind if I blow your... mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be... shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be... fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way

Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night meet the light
Turn to day

I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot your shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

Yeah, yeah
All the lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delay, but I came and you're cool with it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know yourself
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I burn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like the king for a grand
I don't do nothin' that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle's made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow we gotta find a way, okay

Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night meet the light
Turn to day

I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot your shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

A young nigga that's tryna innovate
As many ways as Em and Jay did Renegade
You niggas hold up, don't get no closer

High powers chose us, we never froze up

And yeah, I'm glad that it went through the way it did
Never thought the radio would play the kid
They never care, till you make it big
Now they say triple platinum
Finger fuck the people said that never would happen
Came a long way from the trap
Where they was cookin' up crack
I'm still here Rattpack, keep it real here

Goddamn, said this the Young Sinatra clique, goddamn!
Listen, yeah - I’m visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Step to me, fatality; yeah, this shit is my galaxy
I am who the baddest be, I'd rather be at the academy
Killers, I'm be glad to be me, magnify the shit like bifocal
Motherfuckers talk on the internet, but in person they never vocal
Come to the hood and fuck you up if you prefer to be local
I'm loco from Noho to Soho
Gettin' cheese like a photo, you know, ho
I'm blessed like Sunday, flyer than a runway
Lil' Bobby never second-guessed that he gon' make it one day
One–way or another, my brother, word to your mother
They should give me a badge 'cause I'm always under covers
Goddamn! I'm a miraculous man!
You know I get, I get it, I get it, I get it
The Young Sinatra spit it, rewind it, and rip it
I could murder your whole album with a 30-second snippet
Pass the Mary Jane like I'm runnin' a train with Peter Parker
On tour, I have more sex in the city than Sarah Jessica Parker
The deeper and deeper I go, it get darker
They say they want the old me, they want the Young Sinatra back
The one that murder it, rip it up, no, never givin' up 'round the almanac
Yeah, I'm all of that, fall back, like September again
Baskin' these rappers so hard they won't remember again
When it comes to hip-hop, bitch, I'm indigenous to this
It's apparent I'm bearin' down like a parent
When the beef is at stake, I'm Mastro's

Money, talk, cash knows, greatest of levels – I've passed those

And none of y'all ready for the massacre, though
Fuck with Logic? Yeah, that's a no
Matter of fact, it's not impossible, just highly improbable
Like, saying the police isn't robbable
But I'm liable to walk up in the station in blue-face
Like, "Fuck the police!" - Blue lives ain't a race
Fuck whoever said this rap shit was never a race
This shit a marathon
Murder you motherfuckers and carry on
Claimin' that you really 'bout this shit
You got your Jim Carrey on
Liar Liar; I might crucify ya
Number one till I die, will never retire

Welcome to America baby (uh)
Home of the brave, American Dream (yeah)
Uh, yeah
Let's go


I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team (the American Dream)
First they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team (the American Dream)

You either good or you great
You either real or you fake
That's why I stay spitting the real
Because the real ones relate
Y'all must was raised by some haters
You niggas go 'head and hate
F-F-Four car garage for the 'Rari, that bitch came with the estate
I swear them streets get so tricky, glad I ain't fall for the bait
So focused and I'm determined, can see that shit in my face
You niggas go 'head and face it
Lil bitch, ain't shit 'bout me basic
Hit a lick on them bitches and win an iced out bracelet
Never let my flaws and my past come get the best of me
Turn a two fifty to a half, I got the recipe
First my President was Black, now my President is wack
I ain't never going broke, what's American in that?

I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team (the American Dream)
First they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team (the American Dream)


Got money to make, blow out the candles then cut up the cake
Then I put it on plate, I'm running the game, you running in place
Still a youngin' at heart, but mentally, bitch I'm a hundred-and-eight
Like Pun in the late 90s, my niggas is juggling weight
Running from state to state, gunning up ways to safety
I'm on a paper chase, whatever it takes to make me
A millionaire, silly cause how many really get there?
I mean, how many niggas is Jeezy?
Y'all make this shit sound so easy
Breezy, turn on the TV, see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile, back home, my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be the
Niggas is there on the screen
'Cause that's the American Dream
Now here go the thing, listen
Hysterical screams, coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching them walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number, they no longer care bout the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods, I don't got time to explain
Out of fear that I won't reach 'em and since preaching ain't my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already


I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team (the American Dream)
First they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team (the American Dream)


(Yeah yuh)
These streets made for ballin' (yeah yuh)
Ten toes ain't for fallin' (yeah yuh)
I hear the world callin'
Tell me if ya all in (tell me if ya all in)
Look, look, I gotta eat, I gotta, make money with
I gotta feast, I gotta re-ly on what is known to the travelin' man
Set his own, got my Bible and my rifle in my hand, oh yeah
I gotta eat, I gotta, make money with
I gotta feast, I gotta re-ly on what is known to the travelin' man
Set his own, got my Bible and my rifle in my hand, oh yeah


America, God bless you if it's good to you
America please take my hand
Can you help me underst-
 New Kung Fu Kenny


Throw a steak off the ark
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
X-rated

Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosphin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch

I'll wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother

You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back-

Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) Damn!


It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around


Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag
Is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
Wall Street, corporate offices
Banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to blood?
I'll ask again-oops-accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does


It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar-

I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don't know what's up
What's up, what's up
Yeah, yeah
Ayy

I ain't here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
I'm just here to spread the clues
I'm just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I ain't ashamed to be white
I ain't ashamed to be Black
I ain't ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I'm not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and don't ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I'm good
Sometimes I'm misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you don't wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don't have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don't wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I'm attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I'm a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I'ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I'm black and proud
I'm just as white as that Mona Lisa
I'm just as black as my cousin Keisha
I'm biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead
Glover instead
Like what's up
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more

I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don't belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don't know what's up
What's up, what's up


Go on and let your soul glow
Let your soul glow
Glow
Shine and glow
Let it glow
Glow
Let, let it
Black Spiderman can he save a brother now
Black Spiderman can he save a brother now

Super Kyle flew into the scene
Vowing to vanquish all deadbeat daddies and niggas with too many chains, okay
Don't got no gold but my record is platinum
So picture perfect I don't need a caption
I don't give a fuck 'bout how long you been rappin'
Got flow so old I could spit 'em in Latin
My nigga, what's happenin'?
The only thing you blowin' up is a mattress
I'm in the studio making a classic
Shouldn't you niggas be playing in traffic or buying Supreme?
Doing your thing? You know?
Saving up money for lean?
Y'all put this game on easy as hell
I play this shit on incredibly hard
K.I.D., K.I.D
Fire-spitting kid nigga, you know me
De-de-destroy everything I do, attack, kill everything I see
Super duper, doggy dooder
Shout out to Jesus, that's my shooter
Bad bitches in my kitchen
Cooking food like I live at Hooters
Off of Red Bull and a coffee
FedEx office niggas just copies, huh?
Niggas watch too much boxing
Don't get NyQuil'd tryna be Rocky, nah
Believe me nigga, sleep every single day
With a bow bow boom bink, carry him away

Any MC, RIP, niggas getting slayed
Super duper saber-toothed dooder, bite yo' ass in half
Packin' thunder, doin' Matrix numbers like it's basic math
Hey, flow is like a double play
None of you niggas is safe
Making these hits
Every time I step to the plate I biggity biggity bang, boom, bow
Niggas can't fuck with me now
Doin' shit they don't know how
Doin' it better, makin' yo' girl get wetter
I think I'ma start sellin' towels

Can't explain it

Find you a bed, lil' nigga fall back
That ain't this, bruh, this ain't that
My white friends are so damn cool
They all look like they half-black
Get this record recommended skipping on the Benjis

Shit, gotta pick up a plaque
See you later, gotta blast


Lifestyle on the road, sheesh
Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek
Damn, but we couldn't go to Philippe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning so me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door, they never gave me the key
I had to turn to a ki
Even when I was boy, I was the man in the streets
I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Damn, but she can't keep no fuckin' promises
Shit, I'm comin' with a lot of money
Money comes with a lot of shit
Told Mo, "Bring the studio to everywhere we go" and that's a lot of hits
Slo-mo in my videos when the lights out and all my diamonds hit
Somethin' 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lot of 20's, that's basic
Nigga fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga
If you get caught don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me?
I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad, but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way
So treat me the same way


Shout out Sonny Digital
Vultures at the altar, tell the pastor to watch his back
My girl said she wanted change and then she got a quarterback
Well, damn

The girl of my dreams just became a girl

Can't nobody get up in my car today
Back seat feeling like a charter plane
Bumping Silkk Da Shocker Charge It To The Game
Paint dripping like I'm whipping marmalade
Look at the way that I'm shining
I don't be checking the mileage
She said how much is that Rolie?

Watching Toy Story 3 that's a great fucking movie
City of Jimi, Kurt, Quincy
City of me, Eddie, and Bruce Lee

Sun roof tinted, don't need your opinions
I be on my business, and you be on Tinder
And if I was single, I'd be right there with ya
But I'm committed, keep my dick in my britches
The women are moving their bodies
Sunset through numerous palm trees
Followed by the paparazzi
But they don't get into our party
Tell the bell hop that I'm sorry
We 40 deep in the lobby
Travel the world with a posse
But soon I'll be home
So call up my momma and tell her to pick up the phone
Cause I need that homemade lasagna that's fresh out the stove
Grabbing the keys and I'm fresh out the door
King of my city whose next on the throne

Jump start, I just bought a new whip, push start
Push the coup down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart
Pure art

I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you
Yeah
High up, you're falling back down


Trapped in the concept
Falsely accused
Misused, and misled
Bitch, I'm hoping you fucking rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fucking comforting
And I can't seem to shake this fucking feeling in my...
Cold shoulder, heart broken, misspoken
I'm cut open, the fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd prolly dance
On my grave, inside my head
I see your face, I fucking hate
That I love you still
Yeah

Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies, so just carry on

Wavy like the Seven Seas, living life, let me get it right
Let me give it a minute to get up in it like a beautiful independent woman that's finna make you wait to smash
Come now, let me count this cash
Come now, let me sip this flask
Pockets fat like shawty ass
Jump in the whip, gotta get this gas
Put that shit in drive, I'm live like ammunition
No permission needed, I proceeded to accelerate
Had days with hella hate, but gotta let that anger migrate
All this shit that's on my plate
That food for thought that can't be bought
But only taught, and on the real, know

I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nigga, like we smoking all weekend
And I roll and smoke when I'm drinkin'
Tell them open that door but don't peek in

If we smokin' that dope, it's a reason
Eyes so low from the chiefin'
I be getting high when I wake up
And roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping
Man, I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past
It don't even come to my house
If it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag
We roll up the herb and laugh, kick back, blow a zip
Take it on a plane, know I smoke the same when I'm on a trip
Nigga like me always got weed on 'em (got weed on 'em)
Try to tell me that she don't smoke, later on she joinin'
Ain't no point, no I'm back, keep going in

Section always in the back important
Bad bitch gorgeous, pack imported


I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher

Uh, yeah, I'm finna get up in the feeling
Independent feeling like a boss
Roll a little something, smoke a little something
Kick back and then floss
Chiefin' that Indica in the cut, tell my anxiety to get lost
Fuck a pill, only numb the pain
Man, you know how much that shit cost?
I ain't talking 'bout your pocket
No, I am only talking about the mind
When the cannabis combine with the brain
It be like everything you see, it seem to shine
Smoking that Golden State, everything going great
Got a lot on my plate, not a single complaint
Stack of money in the bank
This that RattPack and that Taylor Gang
They know the face and they know the name
I'm a married man with a bad wife
Never fuck around unless it's Mary Jane
Come play the game, honestly never the same
Just like my flow, got one for every occasion
Living the life so my life is amazing, woo

I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher

Yeah, and if you don't know by now - I smoke weed!
"Hahahaha," how Wiz gonna give me the verse
He ain't gonna give me the laugh though?
"Hahahaha," that shit iconic
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Indica Badu

Yeah yeah yeah (yeah, ooh)
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed (yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
Louder (louder)
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (uhh, yeah, higher)
It's like standing in the...

We just rocked Coachella, I gave her of half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the net
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
Took a church visit, you know, cause the world hectic

Like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know (wash on me, wash on...)
In the ocean, I can't be loved
I don't know a sound
(That's right)

Standing in the ocean (standing in the ocean) (Ooh)
Echoing (echoing), echoing
Standing in the ocean
(Oh baby)
Standing in the ocean
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


I'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
It's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey


I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be


Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey


Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law

Me and my boys, and my boys, we will split a pill
Noodles and pots in a pot was a nigga meal
Now that we on, that we on, we gon' split a mill
I take a jet, take a jet when I'm overseas
None of my girls, of my girls gon' get over me
Shout out to Hawk, shoutout Dooly, shoutout Hennessy
Them be my bros, be my bros till the death of me
Nobody know, -body know how I really be
I got some bars for a nigga if he wanna see
Dress up your talk if a nigga wanna talk to me
Fuck your phone calls, I don't want apologies
Everyone said, yeah they said I was gonna peak
Most number ones, number ones in a nigga league
I think your girl, think your girl, fell in love with me
She say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy

Oh yeah, yeah, I just hit a lick and I know you feelin' some way
(Nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah)

Yesterday, I spent two thousand on a sweater, way
I think the belts inside the store look better on my waist
I think my nuts look better on her face
This bitch got addicted, all she do was take a taste
Now you gettin' mad because you got replaced
The brown boy and the Starboy on a track (yeah)
Haters gonna say this shit is wack
I went to the hills straight from the trap
I'm a fuck your bitch and give her back
She said she pop pills I told her stop it

I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a racist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side

And now I know relationship's my enemy
So stay away from me
I'm warning you
You try to fill the void with every man you meet
'Cause you're upset with me
I'm warning you

'Cause all the nights you slept alone dryin' your eyes
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life
'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you

When you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me
Just call me up again
I'll make you weak
Girl, I'll come to put myself between your legs
Not between your heart
Can't you see?

That all the nights we slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby)
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby)
'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time (don't you waste)
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you

Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns
(Who you gettin' at, Nicki?)
Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle 'em, ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)
Fuck, yeah, 'cause a Queen is what I embody, uh

Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn (yeah)
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn (yeah)
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn (yeah)
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn (yeah)

Yo, you can't wear a Nicki wig and then be Nicki
That's like a fat nigga thinkin' he can be Biggie
One rough ride, now you DMX and Swizzy
One hot video, you Hype? Nah, you just giddy
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named JAY, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, yeah you Nas, bae
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion, would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat and tears in perfectin' my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
I'm Kobe, KD, Kyrie! Pick a K

Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn (yeah)
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn (yeah)
Everytime I get high, I just think about you

Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn (yeah)
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn (yeah)

I see ya, I see you

To my surprise I saw you in my eyes
The nights I cried, repented of the lies
To my, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
To my, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (ooh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (ooh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, burn, baby (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

Look, people ask me what the future is
All I know is I'll be doin' this
All I know is things are moving quick
That's convenient for me 'cause that's how I live
Now they see me out here movin' up
You don't like me, that makes two of us
Time change, yeah, I can't adjust
Yo, it’s who you are not who you was, oh my
Yeah, just went to Europe, they said the single is working
I think I'm learning
I am way more than what people might think when they look on the surface
What is my purpose? Yeah
That is a question that I have been asking myself and it hurts
'Cause it's prolly something I should already know but I don’t know it yet, I'm tryna grow as a person, woo!
I'm sick of people tellin' people I'm here 'cause of marketing dollars, oh
You think that everything is gonna blow just 'cause you market it harder? No
I got my hands in everything, now they out here tryna get to me, stop tryna lecture me
You don't compare to my level of thinking, so why do you think you compare to my energy, huh?
Small circle, but the number's growin'
Fame called me, I'm like, "How you doin'?"
Hung up on him, I ain't ready for it
I'll get back to that when I make album four
Less talkin', I've been workin' more
Better me is what I'm workin' towards
Y'all judgin', but we not in court, no, we not in court, oh Lord!
Last couple years, let's recap
I make a livin' off of writin' out my regrets
I'm doin' me, I don't care where the scene's at
Try to give me feedback, I don't really need that
I used to walk on stage in a V-neck
I used to wear a lil' tie with a black vest
I came a long way, why you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna paint a picture, get the vision, you ain't hear it yet, woo!
Look, hold up, hold up, wait a minute, please
Flow's switchin', I got ADD
Brain scatters when you play the beat
It don't matter what you say to me
I'll be doin' this at 83
I've been doin' this since ABCs
In the major leagues doin' major things, don't play with me, woo!
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Wake up every morning thinkin' I'ma have a bad day
Drive my own car, I don't like the valet
Park then I go into my mind with an AK
Shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
Losin' it all, but I think that I'm okay
Who is involved? I don't know, but I'm insane
Poof! And I'm gone, wanna call me a no name, what!?
I'm prolly not what you thought
I'm prolly not what you thought
I used to judge everybody that wasn't like me 'til I learned it was wrong
Girl told me I should get it together and get out the dark
I'm tryna give her my heart
That's when I sit in my car, writin' for hours until I can barely talk
I mean, where do I start?
Feels like I'm fallin' apart
Act like my image is hard
I always put up my guard
Even when talkin' to God
Sit in my room and I plot
Everything that I'm not
Comes out in the music I jot
I give it all that I got
I give it all that I got!
I'm tryna think out the box, no!
Yeah, I got people standing outside a bus screaming my name
I don't come out and take pictures, they tell me I changed
I don't smile in VIPs, you get mad like, "You know what I paid?"
Guess I don't know what to say
Guess I don't know what to say
I leave it all on the stage
I leave it all on the stage

That's what I thought you said
Now let me offer this as a rebuttal
Ayy, yuh, ayy, okay
Okay, yuh

I got a lot of blue money, new money is racks
Do a show, gimme cash, I ain't payin' no tax
I copped the racks for the day and I counted up ten
Put them racks real estate, multiply it by ten
Niggas subtweet me, I'ont never get tagged
Why you worried about me, go and get you a bag
These niggas broke, no money, miss meals, they weak
Forty hours at yo job wouldn't equal my feet, bitch

But I'm that nigga, shoutout YBN, young nigga flexin'
Transfer two hunnid bands from my savings to my checking
Big money, I been livin' great, Bora Bora with' it
I know these pussy niggas fans of me, go ahead, admit it
 bands in my sleep, work when it's sunny
I done blew up off the 'Tube young nigga funny
Now it's music, my niggas movin' pack like some units
It's confusin', I do not know which bank I be usin'
Too much money, these niggas broke, dusty, and bummy
So I be snatchin' on they bitches then I chew 'em like gummies
It's DDG, get familiar, I be purposely flexin'
And when yo bitch on her phone, I'm the one she be textin'
Watch yo step, these red bottoms cost me a future
Don't touch my wrist, this AP froze like a cooler
These niggas hoes, they only tough over computers
That goofy act like he own but he really a loser
Why I always wear this chain? 'Cause it cost me a fortune
Why yo bitch freakin' on me? 'Cause I'm fuckin' important
She see the ice on my neck, see the splash on my wrist
Sloppy toppy, take her home, then you give her a kiss
Niggas hatin' in my comments but I keep gettin' riches
The only niggas that'll hate got no profile picture
'Cause you a lame, you a fuckin' stain', you should be ashamed
You be cappin' like you shootin', you ain't even got no aim
I ain't really with the beefin' 'less I'm gettin' a check
Cashed out, put 25K on my neck
Yo bitch told me told me, "Come over," told her, "Gimme a sec,"
Speedin' in the i8, almost got in a wreck
Skrt, skrt! Ring, ring- "Be here by eleven,"
I told her, "Why you rushin' me? I'll be there in a second."
I walked in, she butt naked, then I fucked her to seven
I asked her why she keep cheatin'- "'Cause my ex is a peasant."

I got a lot of blue money, new money is racks
Do a show, gimme cash, I ain't payin' no tax
I copped the racks for the day and I counted up ten
Put them racks real estate, multiply it by ten
Niggas subtweet me, I'ont never get tagged
Why you worried about me, go and get you a bag
These niggas broke, no money, miss meals, they weak
Forty hours at yo job wouldn't equal my feet, bitch

Yeah
It's Dolph
Hey bring me some Backwoods up outta there homie, and a cup of ice
And some rubber bands up outta there too homie, yeah
It's 3 PM, 80 degrees outside
I'm in somethin' that go real fast, sitting outside the cornerstore
Six figure client got no business in this area

If it ain't one thing it's a motherfuckin' 'nother
We trapped together than that's my motherfuckin' brother
I pay her bills and buy her designer but I don't love her
She just play her part when it's time to smuggle
I pull up, pick up that bag, and burn rubber
I got a sweet tooth but I stay away from suckers
Nobu in Malibu was my last supper
I fucked her in rush hour traffic, Chris Tucker
Everybody screaming gang gang gang
Them folks come and get you, you gon' tell on the whole gang
She said can she fuck me with my diamond chains
If I ain't in the bank then I'm on the plane
'Bout to go get some money or go spend some money
They stopped me in the airport, had too many benjis on me
They don't want you to live, they don't want you to ball
Them pussies smile in your face, then they pray for you to fall
Young nigga stay focused
But I really want to crash
Think about where you at
Then think about your past
Yeah I really came from shit
But I won't change for shit
My bitch say I'm stuck in my ways
My wrist say I been getting paid

A hundred shots, a hundred shots
Me and my niggas pull up in a hundred drops
My role model used to get a hundred blocks
Street niggas in a tuxedo, we the mob

She looked at my watch too long, now she see stars
I got so high last night I did a show on Mars
Your bitch ate my dick, I caught her on them bars
My pinky ring extra large
Foreigns all in the garage, remember my first menage
Yeah, Tori and Brittany
I'm shopping for diamonds at Tiffany's
No, I don't got no sympathy
She blew my whistle like a referee
Broke black nigga, remember me?
Until I found out that recipe
Started getting about ten a week
Finger on the trigger when I sleep
Yeah nigga, I rather you than me
Backseat, smoking good weed

A hundred shots, a hundred shots
How the fuck you miss a whole hundred shots?

You not welcome at my trap if you don't shop
Before you come through that back door you better knock
They been waiting on this gangster shit to drop
Even them fuck niggas that wish I could be stopped
How many dicks you sucked to get that couple million?
Self made millionaire, oh what a feeling
My niggas came from dealing
Fuck nigga get out your feelings
Your bitch gave me sexual healing
Guess who just walked in the building?
Came out with six bitches
My uncle said that's pimpin'
My diamonds always hittin'
You looking for your bitch, she with me nigga, she ain't missin'
I told you fuck nigga stay out my way, but you didn't listen
Big rocks in my watch
And we put extensions in all of the Glocks

A hundred shots, a hundred shots
How the fuck you miss a whole hundred shots?
Yeah, it's Dolph
How the fuck you miss a whole hundred shots?

Yeah
My mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
Higher than average
Lot of cabbage
Thank God I never abide by the established
Guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
Commissioned by the state, I skate by the masters
Like "Yoo-hoo" with a new-new ridin' passenger
Shout out Oak Cliff, I'm 'bout to fly to Dallas
Decade from now I might just buy the Mavericks
What up, Mark Cuban?
I am only part human, half-man, half-amazing
Plus I'm good at math like I'm Asian
Hate to use stereotypes, but that's light compared to what a nigga get from Caucasians
No race baitin', treat the beat like Playstation
Reporting to you live from the International Space Station
I probably vacation on Mars
The flow is out of this world and so is the bars
Blow the facade right off of your squad
Lil' rappers, I love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in Prague
Look that shit up
A book, nigga, pick that shit up
Expand your vocab
I'm giving out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came around AC, the DC adaptors
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but my niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathias
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack?
Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system
With no sob stories on your prime time television, I can smell a blatant contradiction
Man, listen
Don't want to fuck up my vibe
Let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
KOD, album of the year, undebatably
My cadence be the greatest we've seen since the late MC who's name was The Notorious
Dreamville stacked like the Warriors
Winning back to back
Next up to bat is my nigga Bas
After that Jiddy-J.I.D
That's that New York City kid plus ATL
Me, I'm from the 'Ville but I know them towns well
Before I had a deal I was givin' niggas hell
Now I'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hell


Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up...
Ayy, yeah
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
Yeah, ayy, look


I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
(Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap)
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you never recovered


Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Found me a bitch who gon' eat, it's a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, "Fuck it", I'm goin' on the run
You want it, my dawgs'll look out for the bond


And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y'all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Boy, at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shoot it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me "No" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a numba one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us

And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y'all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch


(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
You seen the overseas drip?

Time can never mend the careless whispers, of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

Should've known better

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know your not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know your not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know your not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong
That you had to leave me alone

Extravagant Hendrix
Switch hands like lil' pitcher
Super astronomical

Peel you off a couple bands, girl like "Here you go"
Then lookin' like the baddest bitch in my videos
I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes
White Phantom, white Phantom or the white rose
Speekin' of modellin', you look marvelous
Hit your girl up and tell' em that you're all iced up (iced up)
I try my best to put my ego first, I'd need to stop it
Keep it real, you lookin' exotic, no

Three rings on my left, I feel like King James
They see the way we represent, they see the way we get it
You can't be never slippin', you gotta show you're different
I came through and took all they bitches with me
Nigga I get all the way faded, I can't get tipsy
I'm eating something, start busting and rushing on a daily basis, I'm guilty
Let this champagne start flowin', drink it up 'til it's empty
Got this V.I.P. section burnin' like a chimney
We ain't gotta emphasize nobody, we done bought the building
Let's go zip out to Australia, we can go to Switzerland
We got a chauffeur and a translator for it, he don't speak English
Sometimes when you speak from your soul it sound like you singing

Peel you off a couple bands, girl like "Here you go"
Then lookin' like the baddest bitch in my videos
I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes
White Phantom, white Phantom or the white rose
Speekin' of modellin', you look marvelous
Hit your girl up and tell' em that you're all iced up (iced up)
I try my best to put my ego first, I'd need to stop it
Keep it real, you lookin' exotic, no

Gotta put a whole lot of kush into my lungs
I put a whole lot of work and I just begun
And when that green money on the turf, it's their call
Gotta put that steel under my shirt and do it large
Fuck the cops, she gon' ride you like my dog
Chinchilla, I put it on and let it fall
Gorilla, let it drag on the floor
I forgot to get the money, lay low
We take shoppin' sprees, I can bring the store to me
I don't get top money, please, bitch I'm out they league
Raf Simons, Rick Owens, cost 200 G's
Cash out mad G's, bustin' down AP's
Hand made one of one Riccardo Tisci
Crystal diamonds on my sleeves, L-O-V-E
Changed the whips about a week, yes I do agree
Louis V on my carry-on, yes indeed
Have to pay for it tonight as you charge a fee
Order the PJ at one, we land tomorrow at three
Steak and shrimps, caviar for seven days
Let's flick it up for my dawgs in the cage

Peel you off a couple bands, girl like "Here you go"
Then lookin' like the baddest bitch in my videos
I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes
White Phantom, white Phantom or the white rose

Keep it real, you lookin' exotic, no

I'm a keep it real with you!
Lookin' exotic
Got a half mil' on me
I'm 'boutta to recount it now


Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me


Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith

Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find


Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
(It's been a long time coming)
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Home, home
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Home, home


Look, I been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever, just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe

Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find


Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone


(Someone take me)
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Take me home
Home, home, take me home
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Someone, someone
Nothing here feels like home
Home, home
(Someone take me)


I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high up (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)


It's a secret society
All we ask is trust
(All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty


Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)


Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, deeper now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established
Hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright


I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, rock (yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know

I done came down so hard I slowed
Honesty forever, all a real nigga want


I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high up (yeah)


(All I want is, all I want is)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

Feel somethin' wrong
(You actin' shifty, you don't ride)
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty


Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart


Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to


Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?


That's what God for


I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high up


(All I want is, all I want is)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty


10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby

My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

In my own way, this feel like living
Some alternate reality
And I was drowning, but now I'm swimming
Through stressful waters to relief
Oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll probably never even tell myself
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it looked like a rain
Gray skies and I'm drifting, not living forever
They told me it only gets better

My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

Who will I rely on when it's over?
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
My worth, my worth

I know you're money hungry
Can't wait 'cause you ain't eat all day
And you gon' lose your mind if you don't get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon' relate
It's a struggle man, I'm with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I got to thank God for everything
It's a miracle how you'll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K


I woke up in the morning on a cold slab
How the hell I'm in a damn cell
I'm in jail taking cold baths
I went down the wrong path
Lil boy don't go that way
You prolly won't last
Before I had the fame I had the name
I earned my stripes like Adidas
Sliding base like I'm Derek Jeter
Growing up with no father, it'll make you evil
How he gon' learn to be a man when you ain't never teach him?
Youngin' can't even read but he totin' the Desert Eagle
Look how she left, I bet she told you she won't never leave you
The same nigga was hating, I turned them to believers
I done made it through the rain and I ain't called FEMA


I know you're money hungry
Can't wait 'cause you ain't eat all day
And you gon' lose your mind if you don't get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon' relate

Everything 1K


I probably thank God 'cause without him who is me?
He unlocked my cell when they threw away the key
Jailbird, I was caged in, he came and set me free
I was just on the news, now I'm on MTV
Hurting 'cause your people ate and you ain't get a piece
Now you're taking from your people plate 'cause you just tryna eat
Grinding for a mil and I ain't talkin' 'bout a combo
My mama need a crib, I been thinking 'bout a condo
You nothing when you down, it's crazy how people treat you
Come around now, you can't even hit the reefer
I pray for all my youngins who done took the same route
Brother from the same struggle, cut from the same cloth


I know you're money hungry
Can't wait 'cause you ain't eat all day
And you gon' lose your mind if you don't get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon' relate
It's a struggle man, I'm with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I got to thank God for everything

Saturday nights, new berry cigarilos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCBs, and it's all for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feud sayin' mom's confused
And for sure she doesn't want to learn
My daddy's gone, so he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

Saturday nights, like bliss over at our house
You try because you have to
Stay up, workin' late at a job you hate
And fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more lovin' the dark clouds
Knowin' whatchu gotta do
You got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere well like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

With all the things that I know
That your parents do
They don't care about you
The way that I do, oh

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
The way that I
The way that I do
The way that I do
The way that I do
The way that I do

Dear… dear, Slim
No
Dear… I wrote you, but you still… mhm
Dear, S– M&…

Dear Eminem, it's Kells
Enough is enough, now you're hurting my feelings, homie
I thought that you promised that after we patty, you tell the world that you really love me
I'm sorry, I said that your beard is weird
Sorry, I went and called Diddy
But lately, it's like you will not even snuggle me, hug me, or touch me, or kiss me


I'm sorry, MGK, but lately you've kind of rude
And if I'm being honest, I just cannot date that kind of dude
You never take me roller skating, never buy me shoes
All you do was fuck me once, and take me out for Chinese food
And at the table you just stare down at your Samsung
I'm sorry that I made fun of your man bun, but damn, hun
You used to have me open like a Swiss army, now you just harm me
I hate the Rap Devil, where's my prince charming?


Oh, you wanna try to complain that I never wanna to take you on a date
Well, last time I tried that shit, homie, you was like 30 minutes late
And you were showing off your cleavage, flirting with the bartender
Plus, I went through your phone, why the fuck you installed Tinder
–Kells


I read you like 
And eat you like an army snack
And fuck you at the Ramen sack until the condom crack
And Imma cock the gat
And shoot a hole up in your stocking cap
'Cause you were sucking Yelawolf's cock in a back of a Pontiac


I ain't cheating with Yela, I'm just cheating with Diddy (bad boy)
And you can say shit about it, 'cause you've been sleeping with 50
I thought we battle just for fun, just for therapy
Why you gotta make that Killshot song and embarrass me?
–Kells


Oh, Jesus Christ, Kells, you started it
I never wanted part of it
Why is everything a fucking argument?
I don't wanna argue now, but you never do the dishes
Never take the garbage out–


Mid stop it, Marshall, wow
You really hurt my feelings, I cannot feel joy your smile
I used to be your fucking party kid, a boy that's wild
But all you do these days is hang with your new Joyner pal
Plus Royce , I heard that he's your boyfriend now


Look, I probably shouldn't say this, but it's worth revealing
But when you said my beard was weird, it hurt my feelings


Would like to apologize, Eminem, let's talk about it


Okay, let's talk about it, by the way, I like your outfit
The leather pants really hug on to your thighs
That choke chain really brings out the color of your eyes
I hate it when we fight, Kells, I love that you're my guy


Let's kiss and make up, Eminem, then go get some fries
–Kells

I used to say I was free
Now all these people wanna keep on taking pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again
It was a breeze for you
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

That you can't blame it on me, yeah
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

Everyday's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible
Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show
Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though
Now I see dead people, most have no faith
Where did the time go? A watch with no face
They hit the ceiling but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me, ayy
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault

It's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes
It's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah
It's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul
It's all my fault

Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

That you can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself I did it all
You can't blame it on me, ayy
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me, yeah
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
