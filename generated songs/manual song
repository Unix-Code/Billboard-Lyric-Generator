1 this is a test song
    2 yeah i said its a test song
    3 these arent real lyrics
    4 they'll be replaced with gibberish
    5 and then some of that gibberish
    6 will become lines of a hook
    7 yeah yeah yeah yeah
    8 we're making some hooks up in this bitch
    9 we at boston hacks
    10 memes are okay
    11 i repeat, this is not a song
    12 i dont even know if my hook generation will work
    13 i gotta make this song pretty damn long
    14 if i want it to be an accurate test example
    15 now that i think of it
    16 i could have just copied and pasted stuff
    17 from the internet
    18 and used that as a song
    19 but at this point im too deep
    20 im just typing a constant stream of consciousness
    21 but i realized the lengths of the lines are kind of irrelevant
    22 so i could
    23 just go
    24 like this
    25 for a
    26 long time
    27 but if
    28 these lines
    29 are chosen as a hook
    30 it would not make much sense
    31 but this song wont make much sense anyway
    32 i just realized that the split string list could
    33 have empty strings in the list as line breaks
    34 but im not sure
    35 okay the song is over
