I’ll be the bad guy
I’ll take the black eye
When I walk out
You can slam the door
I’ll be the S.O.B
If that’s what you need from me
So you don’t have to love me anymore
When you and our friends talk
Make it all my fault
Tell ‘em I’m rotten to the core
I’ll let it all slide
Get ‘em all on your side
So you don’t have to love me anymore


I will keep
All those memories, of the good times
Yeah, there were some good times
So when you think
Of you and me
They won’t even cross your mind


If the wine you’re drinking
Leads you to thinking
That you want what we had before
Girl you can call me
I’ll let it ring and ring
So you don’t have to love me anymore


I will keep
All those memories, of the good times
Yeah, there were some good times
So when you think
Of you and me
They won’t even cross your mind


If you need me to make you cry
I don’t want to but I’ll try
So you don’t have to love me anymore


I'd given up on love
I'd given up on me
Everything before you
Was never as it seemed

I was running out of reasons
I was running out of time
I thought I'd stopped believing
Then you showed me the light


You found me in the darkest night
You're my angel
You saved my life
I can't believe we're standing here

What's mine is yours
And yours is mine
I love you till the end of time
I wanna spend forever with you

I do
I do
I do


I can see us
Growing old and grey
Standing beside you
When we walk through heaven's gates

'Cause soulmates live forever
From one life to the next
We'll always be together
I promise you this




They always say, "you'll know when you know"
I didn't know it could feel like this
With every touch
With every kiss

You found me in the darkest night
You're my angel
You saved my life
I can't believe we're standing here




I met a guy on the red eye
He spotted my guitar and said what do you do?
I said, I sing for a livin'
Country music mixed with a little rock and a little blues
He said I'm sorry but I've never been crazy
'Bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
What ever made you want to sing stuff like that?
I just looked at him and laughed and said


'Cause it's songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me


So I offered him tickets
I said you'll see what I mean if you show up tonight
He said I doubt you'll change my opinion
I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try
Then later on when we finished our songs
About scars and cars and broken hearts
I saw him, he was standing there right next to the stage
And he shouted, man you were right it was like you sang those


Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me


So I'll just keep on singin'
Till I hear the whole world singin', those ole


Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

I walk in the rain and whistle a tune
I talk to the man up there in the moon
I know I may sound like somebody gone insane
I'm a fool about you baby but my heart can't explain

It's a little left of center
By heavenly design
Love gets carried away
And goes wild at times
When cupid aims his arrow
It's right on the mark
A little left of center
Just like my crazy heart

It leaps like a frog when you touch my hand
It means like a drum in a marching band
Can't help what it does I just follow where it leads
How my heart feels about you baby makes perfect sense to me

It's a little left of center
By heavenly design
Love gets carried away
And goes wild at times
When cupid aims his arrow
It's right on the mark
A little left of center
Just like my crazy heart

When cupid aims his arrow
It's right on the mark
A little left of center
Just like my crazy heart


Hey bartender, can I make one special request?
My woman left me, so tonight I'll be drinking your best
I'm not talking about Single Malt, Scotch, Jagermeister, or Cuervo Gold
I'll take anything domestic, light, and cold


Domestic, light, and cold, that's what I'm having
Serve me up any old, iced-down American classic
Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long
I'll take, anything domestic, light, and cold


No, I wasn't cheating She just said that I was hard to please
And I'll admit it: I can be set in my country ways
So go ahead and break out the good stuff, if I can be so bold
I'll take anything domestic, light, and cold




You've got beer from all over the world on the wall
I can even get a free t-shirt, if I try them all
But tonight I'm in the mood for some of that home-grown brew




If she was a drink
She'd be a single-barrelled Bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick
A chill and a burn all at the same time


She's Sunday drive meets
High speed chase
She ain't just a song
She's the whole mixtape
She's so complicated
That's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane



And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
She don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm


I know how to make her laugh
Or blush, or mad at me
But that's okay there ain't no one more beautiful angry


And she loves just as deep
As she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows
Can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane


And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm


She's the girl of a lifetime
A guy like me spends his whole life
Looking for, that girl right there's the perfect storm
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
She destroys me in that t-shirt

Honey I know, you've been alone some
Why don't you fool some, 'cause I love you
And honey I know, I've been away some
I've had to pay some, and you have too

But the one thing I know that when I, I turn out the light
Visions of you dear, dance in the night. I've been
Put down, pushed around, apprehended and led downtown and I
Can't help it if I'm out of sight, 'cause I'm restless tonight

Just can't stand bein' alone
Gonna have to change that someday
There's a restless feeling in my bones, and I know
That at times, it just won't go away

So if it's all the same honey
Can't take the blame baby
Can't play a game honey
Cause true is true

And if in the end, the temptation wears you thin, honey I'll
I'll just pretend that I leave it up to you

But the one thing I know that when I, I turn out the light
Visions of you dear, dance in the night. I've been
Put down, pushed around, apprehended and led downtown. And I
Can't help it if I'm full of fight, cause I

The one thing I know that when I, I turn out the light
Visions of you dear, dance in the night, I've been
Put down pushed around, apprehended and led downtown and I
Can't help it if I'm out of sight, 'cause I'm restless tonight


I need to go shopping
These shoes are all wrong
Just look in my closet
Not a thing to put on
I wonder how these jeans make me look from behind
Things that never cross a man's mind

Lets turn off the TV
Now can't we just talk
Lets lay here and cuddle
Till we both drift off
If we don't make love
That'll be just fine
Things that never cross a man's mind


That joke is too dirty
This steak is too thick
Ain't no way in the world I'll ever finish it
That car is too fast
This beer is too cold
And watching all this football is sure getting old
Wish I was working this weekend
Not on the lake threading my line
Things that never cross a man's mind


Her lips are too red
Her skirt is too tight
Her legs are too long
And her heels are too high
Boy, she looks like the marrying kind
Things that never cross a man's mind


That joke is too dirty
This steak is too thick
Ain't no way in the world I'll ever finish it
That car is too fast
This beer is too cold
And watching all this football is sure getting old
Wish I was working this weekend
Not on the lake threading my line
Things that never cross a man's mind


I feel a little bloated
I think I'm fixing to start
That movie was good except for the violent parts
Brad Pitt is sexy
Why did he change his hair
I knew him and Jenny never had a prayer
These curtains clash with the carpet
The color scheme is a crime
Things that never cross a man's mind
Things that never cross a man's mind


I haven't seen you in forever
Oh you haven't changed a bit
You didn't think that I would remember
How could I forget


We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice


To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did




One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something, baby that's something
Oh that's something
That just don't happen twice

[Outro[
Oh yeah

We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
Yeah we fell in love

I wish somebody told me I would light up
And in a second I would turn to ash
I wish somebody told me I would tear up
Always be out there lookin' for my other half
That I had a paper heart, that I had a paper heart

I wish somebody told me I would roll up
Into a little ball that you could throw away
If I woulda known I woulda folded up
Into a 747 airplane 'cause I've got a paper heart

Shoulda paid attention to the state of my condition
Before I kissed you that way, I shoulda listened
Thought I was a rockin' stone, standin' my ground all on my own
But I was blown away 'cause I've got a paper heart

Oh, I woulda never looked at you if I only, if I knew
Never woulda kissed you that way, I shoulda listened
Thought that I was strong enough, knew all there was to know about love
But I was blown away 'cause I've got a paper heart

I wish somebody told me I would light up
And in a second I would turn to ash
I've got a paper heart, I've got a paper heart
That I had a paper heart, I've got a paper heart

(Shoulda paid attention to the state of my condition)
I wish somebody told me, wish somebody told me
(Woulda never looked at you if I only, if I knew)
I wish somebody told me, yeah

(I wish somebody told me, someone shoulda told me)
I've got a paper heart, I've got a paper heart
(I wish somebody told me, someone shoulda told me)
That I had a paper heart, I've got a paper heart


My grandpa taught me about buck knifes and shot guns
How to cast an old Zebco
And how to work a stick shift
He taught me the bible about all twelve disciples
And he made sure that I know there's life after this
With pearly gates and streets of gold
He said if I just believe that's where I'll go


Lord when I die I wanna live
On the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles
Hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honey bees
And blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven


Now it says in the King James in the Almighty's kingdom
He mentions a mansion that he's built just for me
Now I'd gladly trade it for a farm house with acreage
And a back yard that's shaded and a squeaky front porch swing
That's where I wanna hang my wings


When I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles
Hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honey bees
And blue skies and green grass forever
So Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Yeah


Yeah, the good Lord knows me
He knows I need blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Yeah, when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven

If all of my life
I try and I try
Baby, I could never show you
All this love I have inside
Cause every day when we wake
I look deep into your eyes
I realize

I could kiss you in the rain forever
Turn all of your pain to pleasure
Fill up all your days with sunlight
Make the passion last every night

Give you my every possession
Make you my only obsession
Climb up to the sky
And pull down all the stars above
But I could never love you enough

If i could have one wish it would just be this
That i could take you to my soul
And show you all the love there is
This neverending sea deep inside of me
There's no stopping it
Baby even if

I could kiss you in the rain forever
Turn all of your pain to pleasure
Fill up all your days with sunlight
Make the passion last every night

Give you my every possession
Make you my only obsession
Climb up to the sky
And pull down all the stars above
But i could never love you enough

And no matter what I do
It's never as much as i want to
Baby, it could never be enough

I could kiss you in the rain forever
Turn all of your pain to pleasure
Fill up all your days with sunlight
Make the passion last every night

Give you my every possession
Make you my only obsession
Climb up to the sky
And pull down all the stars above
But i could never love you enough


Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe I’m just getting old
Used to work but now it don’t

A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don’t know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That’ll last a little longer


I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song


I wish I didn’t know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn’t working
But I haven’t lost all hope yet
Yeah it’s hurting but it ain’t dead


I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song


Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just something that I can believe in


I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song

(Ronnie Kingery/Scott Whitehead)
I can remember,like it was yesterday
When daddy sold his Corvair and we watched it drive away
Well,then we walked down the corner with the money that he got
He bought a Mr. Cruiser off of Mr.Kelly's lot
Well,that station wagon was the ugliest thing around
And I'd hide beneath the dashboard everytime we drove through town
Now,21 years later,(21 years later)I got a wife and kid
And I'm standin' here on Kelly's lot,just like my daddy did
And I'm singin'
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Look out 30's,I'm becoming my old man
The keys are in my pocket
I've got the title in my hand
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Sellin' that four by four really hurt my pride
But the cold,hard fact was the lack of room inside
Well,so long to my gone good days,I don't cruise for chicks no more
Now it's luggage racks,and fruit juice packs,and an extra slidin' door
And I'm singin'
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Look out 30's,I'm becoming my old man
The keys in my hand
I've got the keys in my pocket
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
I can see us on the highway,baby's fast asleep
Momma reads a book and I'm in the driver's seat
Headin' off to places we never been before
With everything I need and room for more
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Look out 30's,I'm becoming my old man
The keys are in my pocket
Yeah,I've got the title in my hand
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan


Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His Name, never read her His Word
Two non-believers walkin' lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl


Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV, and sit there on the couch
While her Mom fell asleep, and her Daddy went out


And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding, oh what a sad little life


And like it always does, the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy, in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom, and then took his life


And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad, kisses and hugs everyday


Her first day of Sunday school, the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said, I know that man up there on that cross
I don't know His name, but I know He got off


'Cause He was there in my old house and held me close to His side
As I hid there behind our couch, the night that my parents died


I'm an outdoor kind of a man and I really love the land
From the mountains of Montana to the Alabama sand
I don't care much about TV 'cause there's country yet to see
I'd rather be on the lake with a fishing friend
I'm an outdoor kind of a man


Give me a cane pole and a shotgun
And I can have a whole lot of fun
A soft ole pair of hiking boots
A pocket knife and a campfire too
You go out in the woods alone wonder where the big buck's roam
What's that noise and your heart beats fast
Then you smile when a squirrel runs past
I don't have to get a bear just want to breathe that country air
I'm going out every time I can
I'm an outdoor loving man




I want a mountaintop and a wheat field
A cool clear lake, a rod and a reel
A four-wheeler, a ride on a bike
A horseback trip, a snowshoe hike
The concrete jungle I don't want, I'd rather be out in the swamp
My job's got me tied up so I dream of where the red fern grow
This weekend I'll find where the river bends and the fish jump high
I'll be there every time I can
I'm an outdoor kinda man




I remember the way you made love to me
Like I was all you'd ever need
Did you change your mind?
Well, I didn't change mine
Now here I am trying to make sense of it all
We were best friends, now we don't even talk
You broke my heart
Ripped my world apart


Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?


I can't get you out of my head
I still feel you in this bed
Left me all alone
You couldn't be more gone
From falling apart to fighting mad
From wanting you back to not giving a damn
I've felt it all
I've been to the wall


Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?


One day justice will come and find you
And I'll be right there in your memory to remind you


Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me

My Grandpa farmed for a livin'
Content to live the simpler kind of life
My Grandma worked in the kitchen
Awfully proud to be that farmer's wife
They used to say that they'd got everything that they need
Each mornin' they wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love

Here I am, ring on my finger:
Grandpa's little grandson, all grown up
I found my rock and I plan to keep her
I wish they were here to see the two of us
They'd proud to know we've got everything that we need
Each mornin' we wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love

With the highway twice as wide
And the farmland sub-divided
It's good to know that some things never change
I'm still lovin' an I'm still livin'
By those simple words of wisdom:
Life an' love come down to just four things

My Grandpa, Lord knows, I miss him
An' the way that he and Grandma looked at life
And each day, I count my blessings
To have that kind of love here by my side
No matter what, we know we've got everything that we need
Each mornin' we wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love

Yeah, we've got everything that we need
Between the two of us:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love

Well,I met a pretty boy from Back Bay,Biloxi
Hotter then a pepper,sweet as sticky bun
I was sold on molasses,paintin' up my lashes
I said,"I need a minute can give me one?

One Mississippi,two Mississippi,three Mississippi
Knockin' on my door
Five Mississippi,six Mississippi,seven Mississippi
Can't wait no more

The one thing led to another
Ww went down to the river for a little fun
We were sittin' in a Chevy parked out on the levy
He asked me for a kiss and I gave him one

One Mississippi,two Mississippi,three Mississippi
Comin' up for air
Five Mississippi,six Mississippi,seven Mississippi
Let me die right here

One Mississippi,two Mississippi,three Mississippi
Come on
Five Mississippi,six Mississippi,seven Mississippi
Yeah

Then one day he turned into a preacher
I heard he got married had a daughter and a son
Well,I could have been me but I got cold feet
He said,"Let's have a weddin'"
I said,"What the rush? Hey,let me think about it"
He said,"I'll give you,give you just ..."

One Mississippi,two Mississippi,three Mississippi
That's all he wrote
Five Mississippi,six Mississippi,seven Mississippi
Don't miss the boat

He gave me one Mississippi,two Mississippi,three Mississippi
Knockin' at my door
Five Mississippi,six Mississippi,seven Mississippi
Can't wait no more

He have me one Mississippi
Ah yeah he gave me one Mississippi,yeah yeah

Oh, he gave me one Mississippi


People say she's only in my head
It's going to take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
They don't realize


Is when you're dialing 6 numbers just to hang up the phone
Driving across town just to see if she's home
Waking a friend in the dead of the night
Just to hear him say it's going to be alright
When you're finding things to do not to fall asleep
Because you know she will be there in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory


Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all her pictures off the wall
That ain't helping me at all


Because when you're talking out loud but nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinking more than you ever drank
Sinking down lower than you ever sank
When you find yourself falling down upon your knees
Praying to god, begging him please
That's when she's more than a memory

She's more
She's more


Because when you're dialing her number just to hang up the phone
Driving across town just to see if she's home
Waking a friend in the dead of night
Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright
When you're finding things to do not to fall asleep
Because you know she's waiting in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory


People say she's only in my head
It's going to take time but I'll forget


I bet this road will take me out of here
Take me far away from Amarillo
I bet this car will go real fast
The wheels might even drive me past
The places that you said I'd never go
Oh


The Texas Sky is the biggest one I've seen
But it still ain't big enough for you and me
All the things that make you mad
All the baggage in your past
Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be
So I'll fill her up with hope and worn-out dreams


An I'll grab the wheel and point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
I'll drive until I find the missing piece
You said I wouldn't get too far on a tank of gas
And an empty heart
But I have everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings


Mama said I never should have done it
Should have ended us before we ever started
Daddy knew about my pride so he stood there
And he smiled inside and I pretended that I
Didn't notice a little tear that fell when I said I was going




I've worried about life and
If it's arriving right on time
I guess if you don't jump
You'll never know if you can fly



We were born to mothers who smoked and drank
Our cribs were covered in lead based paint
No child proof lids, no seat belts in cars
Rode bikes with no helmets and still here we are, still here we are
We got daddy's belt when we misbehaved
Had three TV channels you got up to change
No video games and no satellite
All we had were friends and they were outside, playin' outside

Chorus
It was a different life
When we were boys and girls
Not just a different time
It was a different world

School always started the same every day
The pledge of allegiance then someone would pray
Not every kid made the team when they tried
We got disappointed and that was all right, we turned out all right

Chorus

Bridge
No bottled water, we drank from a garden hose
And every Sunday, all the stores were closed
Chorus
Chorus
It was a different world

I stay up late and read a lot at night
Lately she's begun to wonder why
She don't know I'm scared that I'll start talking in my sleep
You're a hard secret to keep

And every time she asks me where I've been
A cheater's paranoia begins
Scrambling for an answer
Anything she might believe
You're a hard secret to keep

One slip of the tongue is all it would take
Just one little note, that I forgot to throw away
The slightest trace of make-up on a shirt that would come clean
You're a hard secret to keep

I never meant for you to touch my heart
Never meant to take one night this far
How much longer can I live this double life I lead
You're a hard secret to keep

I wonder if she feels you every time she touches me
You're a hard secret to keep

When the lonely set in, I fought back the tears
I don't love you anymore is so hard to hear
It felt like a mile from our door to my truck
Somehow I found the strength to fire it up

How lucky am I you said goodbye
At seven o'clock on a Friday night

I won't be lonely long
By the time that first beer is gone
I'll be floatin' on a neon cloud with my friends around
We'll be raising up our glasses and singing out loud

To those done me wrong, drinkin' songs
Hey ladies, tonight it's on
No, I won't be lonely long

Well, I usually ain't much on dancin', but tonight I'm cuttin' up a rug
I get to say no ma'am when the ladies ask if I'm with anyone
When I'm tippin' the band and buyin' everybody shots
Spendin' every dollar I got

I won't be lonely long
By the time that first beer is gone
I'll be floatin' on a neon cloud with my friends around
We'll be raising up our glasses and singing out loud

To those done me wrong, drinkin' songs
Hey ladies, tonight it's on
No, I won't be lonely long

There ain't an empty space in this parkin' lot
Look at all the friends I got

I won't be lonely long
By the time that first beer is gone
I'll be floatin' on a neon cloud with my friends around
We'll be raising up our glasses and singing out loud

To those done me wrong, drinkin' songs
Hey ladies, tonight it's on
No, I won't be lonely long

She called me up this morning
Said there's something you should know
There's a job back home in Boston
And I think I'm gonna go
My parents are in Cambridge
And I've got some old friends there
I know you think this isn't fair

And the tears started fallin'
There was nothing I could say
Even if I fight it
Someone loses either way
Oh, it might as well be China
Or the dark side of the moon
There's no way I can be there every Friday afternoon

I have him every weekend
He's got his own room here
He's all that's kept me going
These past three years
There's little league in Boston
Oh, but who will coach his team?
How's he gonna grow up without me?

And the tears started fallin'
There was nothing I could say
Even if I fight it
Someone loses either way
Oh, it might as well be China
Or the dark side of the moon
There's no way I can be there
Every Friday afternoon

What about Christmas?
If I can't get off of work
What about his birthday?
If I'm not there he'll be hurt
And I know the day is coming
When she'll find someone new
But he'll never love him
Like I do

Well, it might as well be China
Or the dark side of the moon
There's no way I can be there
Every Friday afternoon

So tired of walking 'round
Dragging this ghost
Can't escape the constant link
That wears on my bones
It's too strong to rub it out
It stuck like a stain
A permanent reminder
Driving me insane

I still see finality
In that nickel worth face
Still hide this bitterness
I can almost taste
All the things I should have said
Still echo inside
Can't listen any longer
It won't change goodbye

I scream you name
To the rain fallin' down on me
I break the silence
Inside me
Since you left me with nothing to say
So I scream your name

Anger so very deep
Eats you up inside
Spreaks like a parasite
There's nowhere to hide
I want to let it go
For it smothers my soul
Uncover my heart again
Fill in the hole

I scream your name
To the rain fallin' down on me
I break the silence
Inside me
Since you left me with nothing to say
So I scream your name

To the rain

I fall down to my knees
My face hits the ground
I throw my tears into the storm
As the thunder sounds

I scream your name
To the rain fallin' down on me
I break the silence
Inside me
Since you left me with nothing to say
So I scream your name


Hillbillies love it in the hay!


Tractors parked out in the yard
I say you and me take it down to the barn
Pull it inside and climb to the top
Spread out a blanket in a favorite spot
Pitch that pitchfork out the way
Hillbillies love it in the hay!


Grab that bottle of strawberry wine
Plate full of chicken and some of that pie
We could be there all night long
You know how we get when we get it on
Up in the loft down yonder way (what do ya say?)
Hillbillies love it in the hay!


Lay me down on a bed of gold
Roll me 'round 'til the cows come home
Drive me wild in the soft sweet grass
Hillbillies like it like that


Sun's coming up and the rooster crows
Hound dog chewing on a chicken bone (a chicken bone)
You and me just having a ball
That's a good thing that old mule can't talk (goodness)
Ain't no telling what he might say
Hillbillies love it in the , HEY!


Lay me down on a bed of gold
Roll me 'round 'til the cows come home
Drive me wild in the soft sweet grass (ah yes!)
Hillbillies like it like that


Hey hillbilly, Hey hillbilly
Y'all know what we're talking about
Hey hillbilly, Hey hillbilly

Here We Go

Thinkin' about you baby all the time
On my brain honey I ain't lyin'
Picture you peaceful in my bed
Better wake up you sleepyhead

Thinkin' about things I need to say
Baby this won't wait for no rainy day

I'm all about you all about me
All about locking up knocking knees
All about love all about us
All about baby I'm about to bust

All about kissin' in the big back seat
All about dippin' in the birkon creek
All about goin' down all the way
Hey baby I'm all about it

Well I'd admit it baby yes I do
I get off on the way you move I do
The way that hand lays on your hip
When you shake that finger and you give me lip

Well your redhead temper don't scare me none
Matter of fact it kind of turns me on

I'm all about you all about me
All about locking up knocking knees
All about love all about us
All about baby I'm about to bust

All about kissin' in the big back seat
All about dippin' in the birkon creek
All about goin' down all the way
Hey baby I'm all about it

I ain't about leavin' any room for doubt
Gonna get it all out gonna scream and shout

Well I'm all about you all about me
All about locking up knocking knees
All about love all about us
All about baby I'm about to bust

All about kissin' in the big back seat
All about dippin' in the birkon creek
All about goin' down all the way
Hey baby I'm all about it

Well I'm all about you all about me
All about locking up knocking knees
All about love all about us
All about baby I'm about to bust


Everybody wants an easy ride
On the merry-go-round that we call life
Take a drive on cruise control
Then you wait to find it's a winding road
I had my dreams in view
When the money ran out and the engine blew
Hung my tears out to dry
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky


And I, I was walkin' the clouds
Feelin' so safe and sound
Somethin' else knocks me down


Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss (that's the way)
And that's the way it is


One fine day you wake up
Completely, hoplessly fallin' in love
He's just what you're lookin' for
The only problem is, that the man's not sure
Another guy'll give you everything
The only problem is you don't feel a thing
Well, I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense


Oh, one day you get what you want
But it's not what you think
Then you get what you need


Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss (that's the way)
And that's the way it is


Yeah
They say your soul is growin' but
Sometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'


And that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
And that's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
Oh, and that's the way it is


Oh, that's the way it is (that's the way it is)
Yeah (that's the way it goes)
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
Oh, you gotta bend when the wind blows
Oh, that's the way it goes
That's the way it is
That's the way it goes
Oh, yeah
You gotta roll with the punches


Ilsa was an acrobat who went and fell in love with that
Horatio the human cannonball
A wedding 'neath the big top tent with barkers clowns and elephants
Sideshow family oddities and all
The dog-faced boy howled out with joy
As the tattooed lady was crying
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds


Thomas was a congressman with closets full of skeletons
And dresses that he wore on Friday nights
Phyllis was a pharmacist, a dab of that, a pinch of this
Concocted to suppress her appetite
When the children were fiddling she'd slip 'em some Ritalin
And wait for Thomasina to arrive
Cause ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds


When I play this old guitar from children's shows to smoky bars
I take a break and think about the past
When I stood up in geometry and everybody stared at me
And I tossed my test into the trash
I scratched off my number while hitching out under
That bush league population sign
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds


Now some point a finger and let ignorance linger
If they'd look in the mirror they'd find
That ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds


Oh, it's on now
C'mon


Somebody better call the law
We done took it outside we’re about to brawl
Old boy done put his hands on a woman
Where I come from son, the next thing coming is a
Ass whooping in the parking lot
About to drop this fool right in front of the cops
And I ain’t going to run
I'm proud of what I done


Yeah read me my rights, put me in cuffs
Take me downtown, barney lock me up
And I’ll do my time and raise my right hand
I’ll tell the judge that I'd do it again


Well I heard it through the grapevine
Good daddy and a husband is a-doing time
Said his wife and his kids was in the house
Some old boy broke in, man it all went south
When he dropped the hammer on his forty five
Now he's in the pen; twenty-five to life
I hate to say, but if it'd have been me
Well, I'd have said


Read me my rights, put me in cuffs
Yeah, take me downtown barney lock me up
I’ll do my time and raise my right hand
I’ll tell the judge that I'd do it again


If I have to put the law in my hands, yeah
Well it has time to break
Because I know right from wrong and if you cross that line
Boy all I gotta say is
All I've gotta say, boy


Is read me my rights put me in cuffs
Take me downtown barney lock me up
I’ll do my time and raise my right hand
I’ll tell the judge I’d do it again


Read me my rights, put me in cuffs
Take me downtown, you better lock me up
I’ll do my time and raise my right hand
I’ll tell the judge that I'd do that shit again


Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, 4 wheel drives
In a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started


Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime


If you ain't a 10 you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God almighty


Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime


Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water


Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime


Yeah, I'm a little drunk on you

Should've been easy, but it wasn't
Should be painless, but it's not
Should've seen the truth in you, but I didn't
Should've done a lot of things so what; so what?

If it hadn't been for losing you, I'd still be back in Jackson
Settling for settling, and getting what I got
But where I am, and who I am, was well-worth every lesson
Guess you could say I've learned a lot
Yeah, you broke my heart so what?

Could've cried a river for you, but I wouldn't
I could've just laid down and given up
Could've tried to be somebody I wasn't
I could have asked her name for what; for what?

If it hadn't been for losing you, I'd still be back in Jackson
Settling for settling, and getting what I got
But where I am, and who I am, was well-worth every lesson
Guess you could say I've learned a lot
Yeah, you broke my heart so what?

So what if it hurt me for a little while?
So what if some teardrops had to fall?
So what if I never thought I'd love again.?
I know I'm better for it all

If it hadn't been for losing you, I'd still be back in Jackson
Settling for settling, and getting what I got
But where I am, and who I am, was well-worth every lesson
Guess you could say I've learned a lot
Yeah, you broke my heart so what?
Yeah, you broke my heart so what?


I'm for the low man on the totem pole
And I'm for the underdog god bless his soul
And I'm for the guys still pulling third shift
And the single mom raising her kids

And I'm for the preacher who stay on their knees
And I'm for the sinner who finally believed
And I'm for the farmer with dirt on his hands
And the soldiers who fight for this land


And I'm for the bible
And I'm for the flag
And I'm for the working man

Me and Ol' hag
I'm just one of many who can't get no respect
Politically Uncorrect


I guess my opinion is all out of style
Don't get me started because I can get wild
And I'll make a fight for the forefather's plan
(That's right)
Hell, the world already knows where I stand



Nothing wrong with the bible
Nothing wrong with the flag
Nothing wrong with the working man

Me and Ol' Hag
We're just some of many that can't get no respect
Politically uncorrect
Politically uncorrect


Well I bumped in to your best friend
Said your talking
And thinking of leaving
Everything you've ever known


How far do you wanna go?


Spent the summer months
Saving just enough
Working fast food drive through
For that old fastback fixer up


How far do you wanna go?


Are you looking for a little more
Than this hold-you-down broken town
Better leave now or you'll never know


How far do you wanna go?


I can be the one you can be mine too
We can run away, disappear
Get the hell out of here


Tell me you'll come with me
Tell me you'll run with me
Tell me you love me
How far do you wanna go?


There's an open sky staring back at us
And it's daring us to tear it up
Bury that town in a cloud of dust
How far do you wanna go?


Are you looking for a little more
Than this hold-you-down broken town
Better leave now or you'll never know


How far do you wanna go?


I can be the one you can be mine too
We can run away, disappear
Get the hell out of here


Tell me you'll come with me
Tell me you'll run with me
Tell me you love me
How far do you wanna go?


Bigger dreams came from smaller things baby
Yeah maybe we are a little crazy
But I see that look in your eye
And I can tell your ready to roll
I just need to know
How far do you wanna go?


Are you looking for a little more
Than this hold-you-down broken town
Better leave now or you'll never know


How far do you wanna go?


I can be the one you can be mine too
We can run away, disappear
Get the hell out of here


Tell me you'll come with me
Tell me you'll run with me
Tell me you love me
How far do you wanna go?

Well, my mama used to tell me
A good woman's hard to find
Get a God-fearin', down-home girl that'll stay right by your side
But mama's boy's grown up
And there's been a change in plans
'Cause I love women my mama can't stand

I love little tank tops
Tight fittin' jeans
Blue collar babies who ain't scared of old Jim Beam
Red lipstick on a Daytona tan
I love women my mama can't stand

Now, I'm just a good old boy
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong
Just 'cause I love to hang out
Where the girls hang all night long
I'm kinda partial to the ladies that party with the band
Yeah, I love women my mama can't stand

I love two-timin'
Four-wheel drivin'
Eight-ball shootin' babies
Four-letter-word-usin' girls gone half crazy
Scared as hell of weddin' bells
With diamonds on their hands
I love women my mama can't stand

Well, I probably ought to settle down
Before I get too old
Find an angel that fits my mama's picture perfect mold
But my wild reputation makes me a branded man
'Cause I love women my mama can't stand

I'm talkin' little tank tops
Tight fittin' jeans
Blue collar babies who ain't scared of old Jim Beam
Red lipstick on a Daytona tan
I love women my mama can't stand

From New York to California
Down to Dixie land
I love women my mama can't stand
Ah, there's somethin' 'bout those women
My mama can't stand

Sorry mama


I've been tellin' my dreams to the scarecrow
About the places that I'd like to see
I said, "Friend, do you think I'll ever get there?"
Oh, but he just stands there smilin' back at me
So I confessed my sins to the preacher
About the love I've been prayin' to find
"Is there a brown eyed boy in my future?" Yeah
An' he says, "Girl, you've got nothin' but time"


But how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground when you know
That you were born
You were born to fly?


My daddy, he is grounded like the oak tree
My momma, she is steady as the sun
Oh, you know I love my folks, but I keep starin' down the road
Just lookin' for my one chance to run
Hey, 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird
I will blow in the wind like a seed
I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams
And I will grow up where I'll wandered wild and free


Oh, how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground when you know
That you were born
You were born, yeah
You were born to fly?


So how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground when you know
That you were born
You were born to fly?
Yeah
You were born to fly, fly fly fly


Hey
Ooooh, ooooh


Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again


Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire


You act like you don't know what you're missing
Every time you end up back with him
Cause it's safe, and you're scared
Of everything you're feeling when we're burning the midnight down again


Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire


Every goodbye is bitter sweet
So why should we fight what we both need?


Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire


Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

I like football
Sitting in trees
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I like snakes, snails and puppy dog tails
Drinking long necks iced down in a pail

I like cowboy boots and old guitars
Riding shotgun in muscle cars
I like a good cigar every now and then
What can I say
I'm attracted to men

I'm a guy's girl
In a guy's world
It's all good if you like what you see
Don't be shy
Go on and whistle at me
'Cause in a guy's world
I'm a guy's girl
Lucky for me

Yeah, yeah

I like Southern rock on my radio
And in the back of my truck
I've got a fishing pole
I like counting the stars on a dropped tailgate
Now that's my kinda perfect date

I hate doing my hair
And I don't like to shop
It's okay
We don't have to talk about nothing
But i was wondering
Could you blow off work and just take me hunting

I'm a guy's girl
In a guy's world
It's all good if you like what you see
Don't be shy
Go on and whistle at me
'Cause in a guy's world
I'm a guy's girl

Lucky for me
You're like you

Makes me go
Do do do do do do do do do do do

The Lord loves the drinkin' man
He sends honky-tonk angels to the Promised Land
I hear that he can turn water to wine
Any man that can do that, oh he's good friend of mine
I've been baptized in beer, I'm here to testify
I was speakin' in tongues when I came home last night
Some folks say I'm livin' in sin
But I know the Lord loves the drinkin' man

Well, the preacher man, he told me: "Boy you ain't no good
"Devil's gonna getcha, best start actin' like you should
"All the cold beer and bright lights, stayin' out all night:
"Good Book, it tells me, boy, your soul's gonna burn."
Momma said: "Son, you're headin' down the wrong road
"They don't let honky-tonkers up in Heaven, I've been told."
Don't you worry, Momma, I'll see you up in Heaven
I've been thinking 'bout it and I've come to this conclusion, now:

The Lord loves the drinkin' man
He sends honky-tonk angels to the Promised Land
I hear that he can turn water to wine
Any man that can do that, oh he's good friend of mine
I've been baptized in beer, I'm here to testify
I was speakin' in tongues when I came home last night
Some folks say I'm livin' in sin
But I know the Lord loves the drinkin' man

Well, my Daddy said: "Son you're living your life all wrong
"Lightins gonna strike you down before too long
"That man upstairs, he don't like what you do
"When you reach those Pearly Gates, you ain't getting through."
Well, I've been thinkin', got a brand new plan:
I'm gonna start a little Church down at the Stumble Inn
Yeah, that's right, I'm gonna start my own religion
We'll be drinkin' and dancin' at the church of Hank Williams, yeah

The Lord loves the drinkin' man
He sends honky-tonk angels to the Promised Land
I hear that he can turn water to wine
Any man that can do that, oh, he's good friend of mine
I've been baptized in beer, I'm here to testify
I was speaking in tongues when I came home last night
Some folks say I'm livin' in sin
But I know the Lord loves the drinkin' man
Yeah, he does

The Lord loves the drinkin' man
He sends honky-tonk angels to the Promised Land
I hear that he can turn water to wine
Well, any man that can do that, oh, he's good friend of mine
I've been baptized in beer, I'm here to testify
I was speaking in tongues when I came home last night
Some folks say I'm livin' in sin
But I know the Lord loves;
I hope he does:
The Lord loves the drinkin' man


Touch me
Tell me what you want me to do
I want
To take a little trip around you
You set me on fire
Oh you set me on fire


Light me up inside of this room
I just want to be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby I want you so much
I want to feel your breath on my skin
Find that place we've never been
I want to spend all night
Tangled up
In your love


Kiss me
Kiss me till the sun comes up
Slow, sweet
I can never get enough of your love
You are taking me higher
Oh you are taking me higher


Light me up inside of this room
I just want to be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby I want you so much
I want to feel your breath on my skin
Find that place we've never been

Tangled up
In your love

Baby I want you so much
I want to feel your breath on my skin
Find that place we've never been
I want to spend all night
Tangled up
In your love


Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your bed
Tangled up in your sheets
Tangled up in your head
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love
Yeah

I saw this boy and girl tonight
Remindin' me of you and I
In better days
Then I saw him steal a kiss
I realize your all I miss
And that's all it takes

I get that heart-achin'
On the edge of breakin'
A never-endin' road that's twistin'
Takin' me back to where we were back then
I get that high lonesome
Low down and then some
Whiskey drinkin', what was I thinkin'
Why I ever left you feelin' again

It's been forever since I've seen you
The grass still isn't any greener
On the other side
Someone told me live and learn
Play with fire and you'll get burned
And I did, now, I'm payin the price

I get that heart-achin'
On the edge of breakin'
A never-endin' road that's twistin'
Takin' me back to where we were back then
I get that high lonesome
Low down and then some
Whiskey drinkin', what was I thinkin'
Why I ever left you feelin' again

I tell myself I'm over you
Then I wake up to the cold hard truth
Again and again

I get that heart-achin'
On the edge of breakin'
A never-endin' road that's twistin'
Takin' me back to where we were back then
I get that high lonesome
Low down and then some
Whiskey drinkin', what was I thinkin'
Why I ever left you feelin' again

I get that high lonesome
Low down and then some
Whiskey drinkin', what was I thinkin'
Why I ever left you feelin' again

Whiskey drinkin', what was I thinkin'
Why I ever left you feelin' again

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

Oh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
All your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white


Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear me, are you listening any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speaking terms
Can you help me like before?
I have questioned your existence
My resistance leaves me cold
Can you help me go the distance?
Hello God, hello, hello


This old world has gone to pieces
Can we fix it, is there time?
Hate and violence just increases
We're so selfish, cruel and blind
We fight and kill each other
In your name, defending you
Do you love some more than others?
We're so lost and confused


Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear us, are you listening any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speaking terms
Can you help us like before?
Oh, the free will you have given
We have made a mockery of
This is no way to be living
We're in great need of your love
Hello God


Hello God, can you grant us
Love enough to make amends
(Hello God) Is there still a chance
That we could start again
Hello God, we've learned our lesson
Dear God, don't let us go
More than ever
Hello God, hello, hello
Hello God, we really need you
We can't make it without you
(Hello God) We beseech you
In the name of all that's true
Hello God, please forgive us
For we know not what we do


Hello God, give us one more chance to prove ourselves to you
Hello, God; hello, God


So, so you made a lot of mistakes
Walked down the road a little sideways
Cracked a brick when you hit the wall
Yeah, you've had a pocketfull of regrets
Pull you down faster than a sunset
Hey, it happens to us all
When the cold, hard rain just won't quit
And you can't see your way out of it


You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, don't give in
It'll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable


Love, it can weather any storm
Bring you back to being born, again
Oh, it's the helping hand
When you needed it most
The lightouse shining on the coast
That never goes dim
When your heart is full of doubt
As you think that there's no way out


You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, don't give in
It'll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable
It's unstoppable


Like a river keeps on rollin'
Like a north wind blowin'
Don't it feel good knowin'
Yeah--


You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, don't give in
It'll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable


Love is unstoppable
So, so you made a lot of mistakes
Walked down the road a little sideways
But love, love is unstoppable


Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said "would you mind sitting down for a while
And talking to me? I'm feeling a little low"
She said "I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go"

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?"


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home


So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said "when it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down on the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while"


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home


One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said 'folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead"
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home


I wasn't raised in a castle
I grew up on the outskirts of town
No dresses with golden tassels
The rings on my hand are handed down
But I'm gonna find the one that needs me, see's me
And treats me like I'm already royalty
There ain't nothing priceless on my wrist
I might not fly private, but that don't mean I ain't a queen


Queen's don't hate, queen's don't fight
Queen's don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh
Every jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it
Won't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it
No, queen's ain't fake
A queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh
I ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne
Some girls might, but queen's don't


No, I don't need the tallest tower
To prove to anyone I ain't weak
I turn my pain into power
Every tear's a diamond on my cheek


Queen's don't hate, queen's don't fight
Queen's don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh
Every jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it
Won't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it
No, queen's ain't fake
A queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh
I ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne
Some girls might, but queen's don't


Queens dont break, they just get stronger
There ain't nothing they can't conquer


Queen's don't hate, queen's don't fight
Queen's don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh
Every jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it
Won't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it
No, queen's ain't fake
A queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh
I ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne
Some girls might, but queen's don't


Hey girl, go on now
You know you've got everybody looking


Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the toolbox, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing


Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww


Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me


Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn, yeah, yeah, yeah


Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww


Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me




Now dance like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines, yea
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do


Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww


Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Honey, why you calling me so late
It's kinda hard to talk right now
Honey, why you crying
Is everything okay
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud
Well, my girls in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And yes, I dreamt of you too
Does he know your talking to me
Will it start a fight
No, I don't think she has a clue
Well, my girls in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words
It makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

---- Instrumental Interlude ----

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
Those lips

I never want to say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

Baby, I know it's late
But I just couldn't sleep
I got up to go for a drive

And I would up on your street
I know that we said we shouldn't do this anymore
Ah, but lonely is prone to forget
So, I'm standing at your door
Well, maybe it's not right
Maybe that don't matter tonight

Chorus:
How 'bout one more goodbye
Play with fire just one more time
Let it burn till the morning light
And let it fade away
Girl, we don't even have to pretend
We ain't going back to where we've been
We both know it's not worth another try
But how 'bout w=one more goodbye

I know we'll regret
If you let me in
We can ask for forgiveness tomorrow
If you stay in my arms until then
We don't have to be alone
I don't care if it's wrong

Repeat Chorus

Girl, we don't even have to pretend
We ain't gont gack to whre we've been
We both know it's not worth another try
We both know it's not worth another try
But it's worth one more goodbye
But it's worth one more goodbye
How 'bout one more goodbye


We've been sweating a whole life long just to get this right
It's a work hard hit hard struggle, its a sacrifice


It's time to blow it up
Time to lock and load
Time to take the field
Time to start the show


This is our moment
This is our time
And we are not holding back
Were laying it all on the line
This is our destiny
It's our night to shine
This is our moment
This is our time


We've been playing guitars and banging drums since we ere boys
Trying to impress pretty girls with a lot of noise


It's time to turn it up
Time to rock and roll
Time to take the stage
Time to start the show




It's time to turn it up
Time to rock and roll
Time to take the field
Time to start the show




If anyone asks, you never saw me
And I know you know better than to call me
Let's just hide out under the covers
One more secret between two old lovers
What can it hurt?


I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I've tasted


I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse


I know I said, I said it was over
But it's hard when I miss you to stay sober
So if I show up here at your door again
Oh, it's just me falling off of the wagon
What can it hurt?


I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I've tasted


I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse


I can quit when I'm ready (I can quit)
I ain't hurting nobody but me


I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I've tasted


I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
Oh, no
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse


I was just a normal guy, life was just a nine to five
With bills and pressure, piled up to the sky
She never asked, she knew I'd been, hangin' with my wilder friends
Lookin' for some other way to fly


And three days straight was no big feat, could get by with no food or sleep
And crazy was becomin' my new norm
I'd pass out on the bedroom floor
And sleep right through the calm before the storm


My life was just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high


That southern Baptist parkin' lot, was where I'd go to smoke my pot
An' sit there in my pickup truck and pray
Starin' at that giant cross, just reminded me that I was lost
And it just never seemed to point the way


As soon as Jesus turned his back, I'd find my way across the tracks
Lookin' just to score, another deal
With my back against that damn eightball
I didn't have to think or talk, or feel


My life was just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high


My whole life went through my head, layin' in that motel bed
Watchin' as the cops kicked in the door
I had a job and a piece of land, my sweet wife was my best friend
But I traded that for cocaine and a whore


With my new found sobriety, I've got the time to sit and think
Of all the things I had, and threw away
This prison is much colder than
That one that I was locked up in just yesterday


My life is just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
Hell I can't even tell if I'm alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high


I tell you, the high cost of livin'
It ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high
(Just leave that stuff alone)


Mile marker 203
The gas gauge leanin' on the edge of E
And I'll be danged if the rain ain't pouring down
There's something smoking underneath the hood
It's a bangin' and a clangin' and it can't be good
And it's another 50 miles to the nearest town
Everything I own's in the back in a Hefty bag
I'm outta cigarettes and I'm down to my last drag


I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here


Under fifty thousand miles ago
Before the bad blood and busted radio
You said I was all you'd ever need
But love is blind and little did I know
You were just another dead-end road
Paved with pretty lies and broken dreams
Baby, leaving you is easier than being gone
I don't know what I'll do if one more thing goes wrong


I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here

Oh, no...


I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down
It's too late to turn around
I'd sure hate to break down here


Mile marker 215


Ain't no hay left on the ground
Going to join the sun in sitting down
My last bale and well my tail is dragging
Cotton shirt, Cotton mouth
Cold ones waiting at the house
It's time for me to get down off the wagon


Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
A jukebox and swinging doors
Soft and pretties on a hardwood floor
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun


Find a looker, have her hold my keys
And tell her later we'll be needing these
Grab a cold one, turn it upside down
To that honky tonking sound


Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
Because eight o' clock comes twice a day
And either way you'll find me chasing strays
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun


Shoot the breeze while shooting pool
Dance 'til you're sweating like a rented mule
Getting loud with all my cowboy friends
The party never ends


Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
Looky there who waits for me
Smiling sweetly, holding up my keys
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun


In the land of the midnight sun

If I seem like a little too much to handle
If I laugh like an angel on judgment day
If I burn like the sparks from a roman candle
Oh, baby you made me that way

If my heart starts to pound
Like a bass drum drummin
Like the beat when an old Sun record plays
And if I turn my back when the train is comin'
Oh, baby you made me that way

I used to play it safe
Never thinkin' what I might miss
Who knew there'd come a day
I would come alive like this
With just one kiss

If I choose the edge over the middle
If I moan at the sound of a certain name
And if I lean just this side of illegal
Baby, you made me that way

I used to play it safe
Never thinkin' what I might miss
Who knew there'd come a day
I would come alive like this
With just one kiss

If I seem like a little too much to handle
If I laugh like an angel on judgment day
If I burn like the sparks from a roman candle
Oh, baby you made me that way
Well, I'm proud to say
Oh, baby you made me that way


Well I grew up in a real town
Where the prom queen had a plastic crown
And we really did just drive around
Cause there wasn't shit to do
We didn't know we were real broke
Daddy rolled them real smokes
We drank RC, no real Coke
Our neighbor had a pool


We got green grass and a few trees
But it ain't like what's on TV


This is real life in the real world
We ain't talkin' to no models, we got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good, baby, but it's alright
Real life


We got a dive bar with a real band
They play too loud and they're real bad
But we're real bored so we still dance
And we stay out way too late
Hit the Waffle House for some real food
But that waitress, she's real rude
She got real problems, but we do too
So we tip her anyway


That's just the way that it is
That's just the way that we live


This is real life in the real world
We ain't talkin' to no models, we got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good, baby, but it's alright
Real life

Yeah, we're lovin' real life


We find real love, get real hurt
Fall real hard, shake off the dirt
Pray to God, let's make a deal
I guess it just got real


We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good, baby, but it's alright
Real life

This ain't no fairy tale
It's real life

Wake up, ninety miles an hour
Take the world's fastest shower
Coffee black,microwave it
I'm at at my best caffeinated
Out the door, pick up the pace
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everyplace

That's how it goes
A day in my life
I'm on my toes
From morning to night
Livin' like this
Some might say it's
So exhaustin' frenzied, manic
Call me nuts but I like it frantic

I'm not built for relaxing
I get bored without some action
One speed is all I know
Seize the day,yeah that's my motto
Maybe someday,I'll slow down
Maybe someday,but for now

That's how it goes
A day in my life
I'm on my toes
From morning to night
Livin' like this
Some might say it's
So exhaustin' frenzied,manic
Call me nuts but I like it frantic

Things I haven't done
Keep me on the run
But time sure does fly
When you're having so much fun

That's how it goes
A day in my life
I'm on my toes
From morning to night
Livin' like this
Some might say it's
So exhaustin' frenzied,manic
Call me nuts but I like it frantic

Oh,I like it frantic
Oh,I like it frantic
Yeah,I like it frantic
That's how it goes
I like it frantic


Well the weatherman said it might storm today
I got to hit the field
Got to bail some hay
And I can't let it rain on my daddy's farm
Till I get it all stacked up high in the barn

And I'm going to call my baby
She's been waiting on me
She lives down town on Sycamore Street
And the wheels on the black top
A starting to whine
As I pass that Oklahoma City limit sign


I'm a hayseed
And a plow boy
I'm a farm kid
And a cowboy
I'm a roughneck
My daddy was a roughneck too


I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town


Well her Daddy said child you better let him be
Well I don't like him and he sire don't like me
Momma just says ya'll have a little fun
Ain't doing nothing me and papa ain't done
Open up the door to my pick-up truck
And my baby jumps in and she fires it up
And she gives me a kiss
As I crawl in
We've been waiting all week for a weekend







Yeah it's true I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
Cause that's when country comes to town
Here I come


Another summer day has come and gone away in Paris and Rome
But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know


And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two, I'm fine baby, how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that


Another airplane, another sunny place, I'm lucky I know
But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home


And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me


Another winter day has come and gone away in even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home, let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people I, still feel alone
And I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know


Let me go home
I've had my run, baby I'm done, I'm comin' back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright, I'll be home tonight, I'm coming back home

Hey, y'all, is that my dog up on the roof?
And, good God, why's my car out in the pool?
All I 'member was a phone call, now the party's on
Somebody knockin' at my door

And I don't know what the hell went on round here last night...

Now I'm picking up beer cans, what a mess
Oh Man, who's that passed out in the yard?
All that's left in the fire pit's one of my lawn chairs
And a piece of siding off my barn
Somebody doin donuts musta hit the mailbox
Cause it's laying out there in the road
There's a flood in the bathroom
A hog in kitchen, a dude on my couch with a bloody nose

And I don't know what the hell went on round here last night
But we musta had a good time

Hey y'all why's my bed not in my room?
And, good God, how did my face get black and blue?
All I remember was a bring it on, a pour it strong
And the girls all getting down!

Now I'm picking up beer cans, what a mess, Oh Man
Who's that passed out in the yard?
All that's left in the fire pit's one of my lawn chairs
And a piece of siding off my barn
I guess we used the table top for a game of beer pong
And the back porch for a dance floor
Somebody took a shower rod, turned into a strip pole
Man, there's a hole punched through my door!

Now I don't know what the hell went on round here last night
But we musta had a good time!

I sure could use a cold one, right about now...

Cause I'm picking up beer cans
Oh Man, somebody's passed out in the yard?
All that's left in the fire pit's one of my lawn chairs
And a piece of siding off my barn
Somebody doin donuts musta hit the mailbox
Cause it's laying out there in the road
There's a flood in the bathroom
A hog in kitchen, a dude on my couch with a bloody nose
I guess we used the table top for a game of beer pong
And the back porch for a dance floor
Somebody took a shower rod, turned into a strip pole
Man, there's a hole punched through my door!

I don't know what the hell went on round here last night
I don't know what the hell went on round here last night
But, we musta had a good time!

Heh, heh, heh... yeah we musta had a good time!
We sure had a good time!
We always have a good time!


Kevin wasn't really all that popular in school
But I remember well the day I thought now that guy's pretty cool
He pulled into the parking lot and everybody cheered
Because he had gone and painted his entire Chevy Cavalier camouflage

Camouflage it disappears when it pulls out of his garage
Camouflage-camouflage


I asked Jenny to the prom and her mom knew how to sew
So she made a matching tux and gown from Duck Blind Mossy Oak
We took pictures in the backyard before we went to the dance
And the only thing that you can see is our faces and our hands

Camouflage
Camouflage you should've seen the way it popped with her corsage
Camouflage, camouflage, ain't nothing that doesn't go with camouflage


You can blend in in the country
You can stand out in the fashion world
Be invisible to a white tail, irresistible to a redneck girl


Camouflage, camouflage
Oh you're my favorite color camouflage


You can blend in in the country
You can stand out in the fashion world
Be invisible to a white tail, irresistible to a redneck girl


Well the stars and bars offend some folks and I guess I see why
Nowadays there's still a way to show your southern pride
The only thing as patriotic is the old red white and blue
Is green and gray and black and brown and tan all over too

Camouflage, camouflage
Designed by Mother Nature and by God


It's camouflage, camouflage
Oh you're my favorite color camouflage

I've wished a million wishes on a big empty sky
And i've spent too many endless nights alone
Wondering if i was broken
And why everything felt so wrong
And where do i belong

I see beyond the end of time when i look into your eyes
Its so much bigger than this life and everythings right
I feel so safe
Safe as a child in your arms
This is where i belong

I see my share of troubles
Ohhh ohhh
Tears i've shed in vain
Watched my dreams crumble
But all along the way
Someone heard me pray

The house is quiet now and my
My heart is full and all the ones i love lay fast asleep
And i am complete i turn out the lights
And i whisper goodnight
And i know this is where i belong
This is where i belong

Mr. Know-It-All
Well ya, you think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all
Ain't it, ain't it something y'all
When somebody tells you something 'bout you
Think that they know you more than you do
So you take it down, another pill to swallow


Mr. Bring-Me-Down
Well ya, ya like to bring me down, don't you?
But I ain't laying down, baby, I ain't goin' down
Can't nobody tell me how it's gonna be
Nobody gonna make a fool outta me, baby
You should know that I lead, not follow


Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
Acting like you own me lately
Yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me


Mr. Play-Your-Games
Only got yourself to blame
When you want me back again
But I ain't falling back again
'Cause I'm living my truth without your lies
Let's be clear, baby, this is goodbye
I ain't coming back tomorrow


Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
Acting like you own me lately
Yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me


So what? You've got the world at your feet
And you know everything about everything
But you don't
You still think I'm coming back
But baby, you'll see


Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
Acting like you own me lately
Yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me


Mr. Know-It-All
Well ya, you think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all
Ain't it, yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

I don't know why I'm even calling
I told myself I'm through with falling
Right now I should be running from these thoughts of you
That just keep coming, but I can't

CHORUS
You're in my head, you're in my heart
You're in that song on the radio in my car
Even in my dreams
I feel your skin on my skin
Out of breath, each day ends like it begins
You're in my head

I drove four hundred miles the other day
Biggest mistake that I ever made
'Cause I saw you on every billboard sign
In every car that passed me by I saw your face

CHORUS
You're in my head, you're in my heart
You're in that song on the radio in my car
Even in my dreams
I feel your skin on my skin
Out of breath, each day ends like it begins
You're in my head

Ain't no trigger I can trip
No switch that I can flip
Even if I wanted to
You're in my head

CHORUS
You're in my head, you're in my heart
You're in that song on the radio in my car
Even in my dreams
I feel your skin on my skin
Out of breath, each day ends like it begins
You're in my head

You're in my head
You're in my head
Oh, Yeah

Woke up with my tear stained pillow on the floor again
I think I had a bad dream
Cause I think I had a hard night
Cause you know its been a crazy life

So I jump into the shower and
It feels like my whole body's cryin'
And it has been, cause I had a bad dream
I think I really had a hard night
Cause you know its been a crazy life

CHORUS:
Yeah but thats alright, I dont feel sad
I look outside, the weathers not bad
I know these times are the best I've ever had
And I think im gunna be alright
I think im guna do just fine
And I think im guna okay
I think im guna make it through this crazy life
This crazy life

Saw an old lady walkin cross the street
I try to help her but she pushes me away
I think to myself she must be so scared
And I think she must be so tired
From livin' in this crazy life

(CHORUS)
I'm not tryin' to hide whats real
I know sometimes you get a raw deal
But life is short and time is cruel
But I can't help seein the glass half full, yeah

So I lay my poor tired head on the pillow again
And I pray to god maybe we all can sleep well
Maybe we can dream big
Cause you know it's guna be a crazy life

(CHORUS)


Well there was a little falter at the altar of confession
Down on its knees true love did fall
After 31 days of sleepless nights, she woke up to end it all
With "I love you" on a fresh tattoo engraved upon his chest
She tore her name right off his heart
So here's to the unblessed


Oh love, oh love you fickle thing
Such pretty words and golden rings
It was a broken dream right from the start
Bless their tortured, tangled hearts


Well a blast of confusion coupled with delusion
Makes the best made plans sometimes fail
They wined and they dined, had peace of mind
She bought a gown and he rented tails
But the mighty cloud of destiny came drifting through the gates
And busted up what could have been a perfect, hopeless case


Oh love, oh love you fickle thing
Such pretty words and golden rings
It was a broken dream right from the start
Bless their tortured, tangled hearts


He wondered how she'd take it when he said goodbye
Thought she might do some crying lose some sleep at night
But he had no idea, when he hit the road
That without him in her life, she'd let herself go


Let herself go on a singles cruise
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu
Let herself go to New York City
A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty
When he said he didn't love her no more
She let herself go




She poured her heart a soul into their three-bedroom ranch
Spent her days raisin' babies, ironing his pants
Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note
And without him there to stop her, she let herself go


Let herself go on her first blind-date
Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake
Let herself go, buy a brand new car
Drove down to the beach he always said was too far
Sand sure felt good between her toes





To Vegas once, Honolulu, New York City
Came back knocked-out pretty



For my wedding, I will dress in black
And never again will I look back
Ah, my dark angels we must part
For I've made a sanctuary of my heart

To want what I have
To take what I'm given with grace
For this I pray
On my wedding day

For my wedding, I don't want violins
Or sentimental songs about thick and thin
I want a moment of silence and a moment of prayer
For the love we'll need to make it in the world out there

To want what I have
To take what I'm given with grace
For this I pray
On my wedding day
On my wedding day

I dream, and my dreams are all glory and light
That's what I've wanted for my life
And if it hasn't always been that way
Well, I can dream and I can pray
On my wedding day

So what makes us any different from all the others
Who have tried and failed before us
Maybe nothing, maybe nothing at all
But I pray we're the lucky ones; I pray we never fall

To want what we have
To take what we're given with grace
For these things I pray
On my wedding day
On my wedding day


I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall
And I've been laying here praying, praying she won't call
It's just another call from home
And you'll get it and be gone
And I'll be crying
And I'll be begging you, baby
Beg you not to leave
But I'll be left here waiting
With my heart on my sleeve
Oh, for the next time we'll be here
Seems like a million years
And I think I'm dying
What do I have to do to make you see
She can't love you like me?


Why don't you stay
I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
Don't I give you what you need
When she calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay


You keep telling me, baby
There will come a time
When you will leave her arms
And forever be in mine
But I don't think that's the truth
And I don't like being used and I'm tired of waiting
It's too much pain to have to bear
To love a man you have to share




I can't take it any longer
But my will is getting stronger
And I think I know just what I have to do
I can't waste another minute
After all that I've put in it
I've given you my best
Why does she get the best of you
So next time you find you wanna leave her bed for mine

Why don't you stay
I'm up off my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
You can't give me what I need
When she begs you not to go
There is one thing you should know
I don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay, yeah


Another cheap high rise hotel room
Another place, another show
Another meaningless destination
With nowhere to go


Another time to say "I love you"
Another time to say "goodnight"
Another time to hear a dial tone
'Cause no one wants to fight, why should we fight


'Cause I can see it in your eyes
Is the sparkle gone forever, don't say forever
And I can feel it when we touch
Is the fire out forever, don't say forever


Another time to miss a birthday
Another time to miss my flight
I've missed so much that I don't know what I have
And what I thought I might, what I might, 'cause


I can see it in your eyes
Is the sparkle gone forever, don't say forever
And I can feel it when we touch, is the fire out forever
Don't say forever


Now I'm lyin' beside you
A stranger in your arms
We drift apart together
And come back like a storm, like a storm


Another show up in Decatur
Another one in San Antone
Somewhere else in this equator
Takes me far away from home, I'm comin' home, cause


I can see it in your eyes
The sparkle shines forever, this is forever
And I can feel it when we touch
The fire burns forever, this is forever

The sun kisses the windowsill and I am still
On my second cup of pity me
It's been a long night chasing ghosts but at the most
It's been a rude awakening
That all too late I finally see

That it's

Chorus:
My loss, my lonely
My mistake, mine only
Mine all, mine all mine
And it's my bad, my broken
All my should have's left unspoken
Mine all, mine all mine

I drove you to the edge of the map and after that
I pushed you off just to watch you fall
You never were the bounce back kind
But boy this time you've proven me wrong after all
Now I'm the one who's gonna crawl

'Cause it's
Repeat chorus

Always thought I'd get to sorry
But the chance has come and gone
So if it finds it's way back in
I'll hold on hold on hold on

My loss, my lonely
My mistake, mine only
Mine all, mine all, mine all mine

(fade)


I've been thinking 'bout you all day, baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town


I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It’s supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I’m going to have to hold you tight, yeah


About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train


Yeah, I hope it’s gonna be a long one
And if we’re lucky, it’s moving slow
I wouldn’t mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Let’s go


About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train

About a mile off Old Mill Road
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train

Well, enough
Of this nonsense, baby
We're bigger than this
Let's get back to us
And the thrill we felt with our first kiss
You know the road can take us
Out where we both feel so alive
Let's go tonight
You can put your lipstick on while I drive

Chorus:
We can go down to old El Paso
Spend the night in New Orleans
Go out to California like we've always dreamed
Makin' love out in the desert
I can watch the sunset in your eyes
Let's go tonight
You can put your lipstick on while I drive
(You can put your lipstick on while I drive)
(While I drive)

Well, I'm tired
Of this life we're livin'
Dreamin' dead-end dreams
Like a worn-out ol' shag carpet frayin' at the seams
You know we got to change it
No waitin' 'til the time is right
Let's go tonight
You can put your lipstick on while I drive

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
Let me touch you
Let me love you
Let your heart race next to mine

(Repeat Chorus)


Ahh Yeah
What's That Smell?


Wanda is a woman she works down the hall
Shows up on time, she's like balls to the wall
She went out to lunch with her High School Friends
'Bout three hours later she came rollin' back in
Well, the boss man really jumped her
Son he wasn't joking
Everybody in the office knew Wanda had been smokin'


That old Wacky Tobaccy
When you feel it creeping up on you
That old Wacky Tobaccy
Kick back and let it do what it do


Know you can two tote her, you can one hit him
Puff it in a pipe and you can twist it in a stem
You can bake it in some brownies, smoke it through a Bong
Roll up a great big fat one like ol' Cheech and Chong
Burn it through a hole
In a can of Budweiser
If you can't take the heat son vaporizer


That old Wacky Tobaccy
When you feel it creeping up on you
That old Wacky Tobaccy
Kick back and let it do what it do


Now Do What You Do
Oh Yeah


You got your Mexican and Jamaican with those buds of blue
Humboldt County and Hydroponic too
Okeechobee Purple from down in the South
And that ol' stuff your uncle smokes 'ill give you cotton mouth
Homegrown is healthy, synthetic can kill ya
My all time favorite is redhead sensimilla


That old Wacky Tobaccy
When you feel it creeping up on you
That old Wacky Tobaccy
Kick back and let it do what it do


Awww let it do what it do
Yeah it Do
Y'all Got any Frito's

Had a rusty hot rod
On a country road
And a John Deere tractor
With a radio
Just a long haired farmboy
With jukebox dreams
Hit the town on weekends
Just to blow off some steam (You know what I mean)

Chorus-
Yea the years roll by the world don't stop
And all these memories are all I got
But the love I leave in my wildest dreams will live on
Long after I'm gone
Long after I'm gone

Well I hug my babies
And I kiss my wife
Don't take for granted
A single breath of this life
And I count my blessings
Each and every day
Because tomorrow ya know it just might be too late
I know what I say...

That the years roll by the world don't stop
And all these memories are all I got
But the love I leave in my wildest dreams will live on
Long after I'm gone
Long after I'm gone

Yea the years roll by the world don't stop
And all these memories are all I got
But the love I leave in my wildest dreams will live on
They will live on They will live on
Long after I'm gone
Long after I'm gone
Long after I'm gone (Oooh)


My neighbor Carl, he lives next door
Pink flamingos on his porch
At night he teaches driving school
And he sits out by his plastic pool

He takes off his shirt he opens up a cold one
Old Carls he's a fool but it takes one to know one


Music is playing up and down the block
Mostly Christian blues, country folk and southern rock
It's our little piece of paradise way out here in the woods
There is always something going on down in the trailerhood


Across the street there is gambling Jane who is always got the poker game
If you care to try your luck you can buy a seat for 15 bucks
You can call to raise or you can check and fold them
I like five card stud but it is mostly Texas hold 'em




My new tattoos and farmer tans, rodeo and nascar fans
Dallas Cowboy football on TV
When the storm starts getting bad, you hear the those sirens humming
Grab a six pack and a lawn chair there is a tornado coming




I got her made in the shade with the moonshine lemonade
There is a party going on down in the trailerhood


I remember looking up
To look up to him
And I remember most the time
He wasn't there
I'd be waiting at the door
When he got home at night
He'd pass me by to go to pass out in his chair


And I'd say
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're swaying side to side
You're footsteps make me dizzy
And no matter how I try
I keep tripping and stumbling
If you'd look down here you'd see
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're leading me


He stumbled in the gym
On graduation day
And I couldn't help but feel
So ashamed
And I wasn't surprised a bit
When he didn't stay
He stumbled out before they called my name


And I'd say
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're swaying side to side
You're footsteps make me dizzy
And no matter how I try
I keep tripping and stumbling
If you'd look down here you'd see
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're leading me


The old mans still like he always was
But I love him anyway
If I've learned one thing from him
Its my kids will never have to say


And I'd say
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're swaying side to side
You're footsteps make me dizzy
And no matter how I try
I keep tripping and stumbling
If you'd look down here you'd see
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're leading me


Yeah walk a little straighter daddy
You're leading me


Love, something you know nothing of
Cause love don't turn and run
And leave you standing in the dark
You, tell me that your feelings changed
And you don't want to stay and break my heart
Well baby, it's too late


Cause what about the times that you said to me
That I was everything that you'd ever need
How come you just up and walk away
And look me in the eye and say


You did it all for love
You did it all for love
You did it all for love
You did it all for love


Love, what was I supposed to do?
Falling out can be so cruel
But I just can't ignore the truth
So, don't tell me I don't understand
Cause I don't want this on my hands
But it's all that's left to do


Everything you want's what we used to be
And I can't fight these feelings inside of me
As much as this hurts, it's the only way
Believe me when I say


I did it all for love
I did it all for love
I did it all for love
I did it all for love


Love, something you know nothing of
Cause if you did, there's still be an us
I did it all for love

C'mon hurry, ain't no time for worrying
Gotta go, move On

Just leave the lights on, grab some clothes
Set those sights on that four lane road
I'm Gone

In a truck, in a train, in a car, in a bus
Change my luck, can't stay, going far in a rush
Got that getaway feeling
I'm leavin'

Trust me, something better's gotta be right around this next turn
Gonna be just fine, toss the map, don't look behind, push that peddle down, burn

In a truck, in a train, in a car, in a bus
Change my luck, can't stay, going far in a rush
Got that getaway feeling
I'm leavin'

In a truck, in a train, in a car, in a bus
Change my luck, can't stay, going far in a rush
White lines, exit signs, can't fly fast enough
Blacktop, railway, spinning wheels, don't stop

Got that getaway feeling
Got that getaway feeling
I'm leavin'

If someone were to read my history
They would know why it's no mystery
She's not ordinary, it's her love I carry
I was born, born to be blue

I'm the fool who sees tomorrow
But all that time has just been borrowed
She's the only reason that I keep believin'
I was born, born to be blue

For everybody, there's someone just for them
And like anybody, you lose one every now and then
For everybody, there's someone just for them
And like anybody, you lose one every now and then

I have found that I'm still fallin'
Maybe I have found my callin'
She's the only reason that I keep believin'
I was born, born to be blue

She's not ordinary
It's her love I carry
I was born, born to be blue
I was born, born to be blue


I spent fifteen hundred dollars on your damn dog's collar
Put new spinners on you escalate
I swear I almost started crying
When you brought up being' diamonds
Lord I'm spending more than I'm getting paid
You got more purses than Versace
Got more rings that Liberace
Fill your closes full of fancy shoes
All my credit cards are Cooking
Girl you don't know what your putting' me through
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you


You got me walking' past the fellas
Holdin' drinks with pink umbrellas
On some island that I can't even spell
Then we slide over to Gucci
Right before we go for sushi
That's a version of my personal hell
You just spent all day long trying on Louis Vitton
There's a thousand things that I'd rather do
Lord my mom would beat me senseless
If she saw what I was spending on you
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you


You gonna break my bank before too long
I'm taking out a loan
But when you turn your kind of loving' on
Honey I just can't say no, no no no no no no


You gonna break my bank before too long
I'm running out of dough
But when you turn you kind of magic on
Honey I just can't say no, no no no


Maybe I'll play the stock market
Put some money in my pocket
Ain't no telling what your gonna need next
I need to steal a Sherman tank
Just to break into a bank
I pray to God this song will be a success
All my buddies think it's funny
'Cause I'm spending all my money
On some honey like there's something to prove
Cause for a little of your loving
There ain't nothing much that I wouldn't do
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you
No no no no
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you


Oh, babe


Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof, talkin' to the moon
Countin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this


But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you


I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tried without you by my side
I'd be dreamin with my eyes open
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe


But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you, no
I can't sleep without you, no, no


I bet that DJ'S playin' your song
And your carryin' on
Baby I love the thought of that long as I know I'm the one you're comin home to


But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up

I can't sleep without you, no
Can't sleep without you
I can't sleep without you
Never thought I would be like this
Just wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss

Capo 1st

I had big plans for our future
Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried makin' good on that promise
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start

Now some people think I'm a loser
Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along

Chorus:
I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do

But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart
Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of_ intentions

Instrumental:

Chorus

So here I am asking forgiveness
And praying that you'll understand
Don't think I take you for granted
Girl I know just how lucky I am
Though you deserve so much better
You won't find devotion more true
Cause I've had the best of intentions
Girl I've had the best of intentions
Yes, I've had the best of intentions
Loving you


I wake up one morning and it's passed you by
You don't know when and you don't know why
I feel like an old memory hangin' round
And man, we've got to face it, it's a young man's town
I knew this day was comin' all along
Some why bitch an' moan and say they done you wrong
Just teach 'em what you know and pass it on down
'Cause man, you gotta face it, it's a young man's town


It's a young man's town
Full of young man's dreams
And all God's children gotta learn to spread their wings
And sometimes you gotta stand back
And watch 'em burn it to the ground
Even though you built it, it's a young man's town


You always seem to be the last to know
Man, that's just the way that the story goes
There's nothin' you can do when the fields have turned brown
An' man, you gotta face it, it's a young man's town




Sometimes you gotta stand back
And watch 'em burn it to the ground
Even though you built it, it's a young man's town
It's a young man's town


It's been a wreck me week
Sixty plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Busting it up for a couple of bucks
But it ain't no thing
Just another day till I'm on my way
To them cool, cool sheets and you and me


Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby


Gonna rock it right
No need to talk, I know what you want
And what you like
Cause I do too, yeah
I love how you leave on the lights
Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are


Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby


Yeah, yeah
It's been a wreck me week
Oh, but who needs sleep?


Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby
Loving how we're working on the night shift
Loving how we're working on the night shift
Working on the night shift, baby

It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin
Just what I do when I can't get no lovin

Jesse James was an outlaw man
He was always breakin' the law
Six guns firing from both his hands
Fastest you ever saw
Did he do it for the money
Or was it for the fame
Finally somebody asked him
Jesse, why you wanna rob them trains
And Jesse said

It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
I'm the meanest hombre you ever saw
'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all
It's just what I do
It's just what I do

Well Orville Wright
Set his sights
High up in the air
Him and Wilbur worked day and night
He didn't seem to care
Well the town folk said if you were meant to fly
God would have given you wings
What makes you want to spend all of your time
Building that flying machine
And Orville said

It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
I'm the first fly-boy you ever saw
'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all
It's just what I do
It's just what I do
Ooh yeah

Well Picasso painted them pictures
There was beauty in every stroke
When asked about his motivation
He said, I think it's about time you should know
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
I'm the workinest painter that you ever saw
'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all
It's just what I do
It's just what I do
Ohhh yeah
It's just what I doooooo...
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'


The week was long
But now it's gone, the drink is on
So fill your cup and turn the good time music up
Pick up that sweet, somebody wrap your arms around this Friday night
Get a little lost in the party
Float your trouble like a champagne bubble, saying
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Find an old school way-and-bee
And put a little shine on the bottle seat
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night


The night is young
The night is free
And so are we
So let it out
And let me stay inside your drink
Lipstick all along
Next sipping star lie on the window tripping down
Off in the distance the lights of town
Can you see it now?


Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Find an old school way-and-bee
And put a little shine on the bottle seat
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I broke my bat on Johnny's head
Somebody snitched on me
I hid a frog in sister's bed
Somebody snitched on me
I spilled some ink on Mommy's rug
I made Tommy eat a bug
Bought some gum with a penny slug
Somebody snitched on me


(Oh) I'm getting nothing for Christmas
Mommy and Daddy are mad
I'm getting nothing for Christmas
Because I ain't been nothing but bad


I put a tack on teacher's chair
Somebody snitched on me
I tied a knot in Susie's hair
Somebody snitched on me
I did a dance on Grandma's plants
Climbed a tree and tore my pants
Filled the sugar bowl up with ants
Somebody snitched on me




I won't be seeing Santa Claus
Somebody snitched on me
He won't come visit me because
Somebody snitched on me
Next year I'll be going straight
Next year I'll be good, just wait
I'd start now, but it's too late
Somebody snitched on me




Because I can't be nothing but bad
Because I ain't been nothing but bad

You got to me
I got to you
We got somethin' that's steady and true
It's a good good lovin'

Backroads boy
Bright-eyed girl
With our own little piece of the world
It's a good good lovin'
Yeah, it is

Chorus

Gimme that sweet, sweet surrender
For as long as I can remember
It's been the real thing
We ain't pretenders
Yes, you're somethin'
Ooh baby, that good good lovin'

Rooster crows
Up with the sun
Come home runnin' when the day is done
For the good good lovin'

Front porch swing
Starry night
Doin' our thing and doin' it right
It's a good good lovin'
Yeah, it is

2nd Chorus

Gimme that sweet, sweet surrender
January through December
Baby, it's the real thing
We ain't pretenders
It's next to nothin'
Ooh baby, that good good lovin'

Time for bed
Steal another kiss
Ain't no feelin' better than this
It's a good good lovin'

Close my eyes
Start to pray
Ask the Lord for one more day
Of the good good lovin'
'Cause it is

3rd Chorus

That sweet, sweet surrender
January through December
Yeah, it's the real thing
We ain't pretenders
Yeah, extra somethin'
Oh, it's next to nothin'
Ooh baby, that good good lovin'
Yeah, good good lovin'
Yeah
Good good, good good lovin'
That's good, bro

There's a piece of prairie with a white picket gate
The geographic center of the lower forty-eight
How long it's been in our family is anybody's guess
We were riding these plains before the pony express

There's a sycamore tree all splintered and brown
Well, it used to touch the sky, 'til the twister came around
It's got this one green branch pointing in the air
Yeah, it's still hanging on, just like the people 'round here

You can hold back the rain, bring on the wind
Knock us right down, we'll get up again
We've dug in deep, made our stand
This is our homeland

I can feel their spirit deep in my bones
Up on the hill, we carved it in stone
Been a long line before us and little ones to come
Yeah, it's a family thing that we're carrying on

You can hold back the rain, bring on the wind
Knock us right down, we'll get up again
We've dug in deep, made our stand
This is our homeland

We've dug in deep, we've made our stand
This is our homeland
This is our homeland
This is our home

This is our homeland
This is our homeland
This is our homeland
...

Verse 1:

The only ground I ever owned
Was stickin' to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch
At this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up
With rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences
Like that's where it was hung

My blessings aren't in front of me
It's not about the land
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

Chorus:

There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

Verse 2:

I've traveled here and everywhere
Following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air
Brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach
From sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home
To the one He made for me

Cause anywhere I go
And everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in

Chorus:

There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

Bridge:

I've seen what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in
Not when I'm looking out

(chorus)

Final Chorus:

Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk
(From my front porch looking in)
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them, oh, yeah
(Beautiful girl)
(From my front porch looking in)


Feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Ain't nothin' wrong, naw we just rollin' along
Livin' the high life, yeah
Livin' the high life


Let me paint this picture for ya, small town on a Friday night
Football and a Facebook party, one post tell everybody
Win or lose, we're still gonna crank it
Mix it up, I bet we drink it
Don't worry, know what we doin'
Head home when the sun starts movin'
No sleep gotta get to work quick
Good Lord that girl was worth it
That kiss sure had me buzzin'
That kiss got my boss cussin'
It's alright, I'ma get this job one
Later on she'll be ridin' shotgun
My life, high life is perfect
My truck, my girl, all worth it


Feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Movin' and groovin' to the flow of a favorite song
Bass bumpin', beat's tight, everybody gettin' right
Hands in the air and we're singin' along
Bottle tops poppin', the cameras ain't stoppin'
Tailgates droppin', this whole town's rockin'
Yeah we're feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Ain't nothin' wrong, no, we're just rollin' along
Livin' the high life


Saturday, on Friday repeat, meet everybody up in the town square
Gotta see where the party's gonna be
Sure hope Sara Beth's gonna be there
Sheriff Thompson said Scott just got home
Spent 18 months in Iraq
Gonna pick him up and get gone
Gonna raise a little hell 'cause he's back
You gotta make time for your friends
You gotta make time for your work
You gotta find a girl you can love, live life for all that it's worth
Everyday I thank God for it, this life is such a blessing
Escape that concrete jungle, come see what y'all been missin'


Feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Movin' and groovin' to the flow of a favorite song

Front porch little guitar pickin'
Sweet tea and apple pie, country girl right by my side
So right it can't be wrong, wanna hear y'all sing along


Feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Movin' and groovin' to the flow of a favorite song

Movin' and groovin' to the flow of a favorite song

Hands in the air and we're singin' along
Livin' the high life


It ticks just like a Timex
It never lets up on you
Who said life was easy
The job is never through
It'll run us till we're ragged
It'll harden our hearts
And love could use a day of rest
Before we both start falling apart


Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Storming like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday


Your love is like religion
A cross in Mexico
And your kiss is like the innocence
Of a prayer nailed to a door
Oh surrender in much sweeter
When we both let it go
Let the water wash our bodies clean
And love wash our souls


Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain
Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain




My brother said that I
Was rotten to the core
I was the youngest child
So I got by with more


I guess she was tired by
The time I came along
She'd laugh until she cried
I could do no wrong
She would always save me
Because I was her baby


I worked a factory in Ohio
A shrimp boat in the Bayou
I drove a truck in Birmingham
Turned 21 in Cincinnati
I called home to mom and daddy
I said "Your boy is now a man"
She said "I don't care if you're 80
You’ll always be my baby"


She loved that photograph
Of our whole family
She'd always point us out
For all her friends to see


That's Greg he's doing great
He really loves his job
And Ronnie with his 2 kids
How about that wife he's got
And that one's kind of crazy
But that one is my baby


I got a call in Alabama
Said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly
Cause your mamma really needs you
And says she's got to see you
She might not make it through the night
The whole way I drove 80
So she could see her baby


She looked like she was sleeping
And my family had been weeping
By the time that I got to her side
And I knew that she'd been taken
And my heart it was breaking
I never got to say goodbye


I softly kissed that lady
And cried just like a baby


I never thought you’d pick up the phone
It's Friday night, you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be sittin' at home all alone like me
Nothin' on TV, nothin' to do
Nothin' to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinkin' 'bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time


We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight


That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those kiss me eyes, your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be
Baby I want you and and you want me and


We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight



I can be there in five
One more one last time


We don't have to be lonely tonight
(Oh, I need you, and I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight, tonight, tonight

Yeah, yeah


I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
There was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She'd found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me


I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it


Sometimes I feel like a clown
Can't wash off his makeup
The life she wanted, it was gone
Prince Charming I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
Oh, but like the tide, her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go


I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it (now she sees right through me)
Should I hold on to what we have got?
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I saw goodbye in her eyes


I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He is going to love the way you shine (so did I)
So did I
So don't smile at me if it ain't what you mean
(Goodbye)


With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me)
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes)
Should I hold on?
We will never make it (now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes)
Should I hold on?
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in your eyes


I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that it's over

Oh, I met this girl I swore was close to perfect
I could see the ring, the dress, and the whole nine yards
I had a country station on and she reached and turned it
Said she couldn't stand the sound of a steel guitar
We hit the town to catch an early movie
And ol' Kris Kristofferson played the leading role
I said "That's my man!" She said "Who's he?"
I jumped up and said "Girl, we gotta go!"

She dont like to play my kinda music
She's never heard a Waylon Jennings song
She's never been a fan of Willie Nelson
So there ain't no way in hell we'll get along

She told me she thinks country musics hokey
She said "You can't dance to it, and all the songs are sad."
I cocked my eyebrow and said "You must be jokin!"
"Ain't no excuse for havin taste that bad."
Then I asked her if she'd heard of Alan Jackson
And she said "Didn't he sing that song called 'Where Were You?'"
I said "Ya, but girl, that man's a livin' legend."
And she said "Really? I thought he was new."

She dont like tp play my kinda music
She's never heard of David Allan Coe
She can't get enough of Whitney Houston
And I'm thinkin "Lord, that's all i need to know."

So when the night was over i walked her to her door
And i bid that girl an overdue farewell
And without a good night kiss i jumped back in my truck
Turned on some Hank and cranked it loud as hell

She don't like to play my kinda music
She don't know Sunday morning comin down
She can't see what's so cool about he stopped lovin' her today
Or angel flying to close to the ground
She told me that she sorta likes the Eagles
She couldn't name one hit by Johnny Cash

No, she don't like to play my kinda music
So i had to tell that girl to kiss my ass!


You wanna see what over looks like?
Ya ain't gotta go far, just a few blocks down
You wanna see a picture of goodbye?
Chairs on the table
Smoke hanging 'round the ceiling from the night before
Light coming through the crack in the door


Nothing says gone like a parking lot with only one car in it
Nothing says gone like an empty glass
Or sitting on the bar in the middle of the day
In a blue light haze, all alone
Nothing says gone like high noon neon


She could be a left lane blur
Wind in her hair, blowing through another town
Or staring out over a wing
Tears on her face, head in the clouds
It doesn't really matter now


Nothing says gone like a parking lot with only one car in it
Nothing says gone like an empty glass
Or sitting on the bar in the middle of the day
In a blue light haze, all alone
Nothing says gone like high noon neon

Nothing says gone like 12 o clock on the rocks
And nothing says over like a parking lot with only one car in it
Nothing says gone like an empty glass
Or sitting on the bar in the middle of the day
In a blue light haze, all alone
Nothing says gone like high noon neon

Sweet southern smell of summer in Savannah
Tailgate drop Tuscaloosa, Alabama
That's my hometown
Yeah that's my hometown

New York City, subway on the run
San Diego surfers, soaking in the sun
That's my hometown
America's my hometown

We got blue collar people
Little pink houses
White church steeples
Wishes in a fountain

If you know every name on your street
And you know them then you know me
That's my hometown
America's my hometown

Trash can fire, north Detroit
Seventh inning stretch Chicago, Illinois
That's my hometown
America's my hometown

Down in Nashville
Out in Hot Springs
See idle settin' tone
Doin' nothing

We got blue collar people
Little pink houses
White church steeples
Wishes in a fountain

If you know every name on your street
And you know them then you know me
That's my hometown
America's my hometown

Yeah that's my hometown
America's my hometown

Stars shinin' down on Memphis at night
Reminds me of those lost Vegas lights
Big Sky Montana to New Orleans
And every one light city that sits in between

That's my hometown
America's my hometown
Yeah that's my hometown
America's my hometown

We got blue collar people
Little pink houses
White church steeples
Wishes in a fountain

If you know every name on your street
And you know them then you know me
That's my hometown
America's my hometown

Yeah that's my hometown
America's my hometown


If it weren't for kids have you ever thought
There wouldn't be no Santa Clause
Look what the stork just brought
Thank God for Kids
We'd all live in a quiet house
Without Big Bird or a Mickey Mouse
And Kool-aid on the couch
Thank God for Kids


Thank God for kids there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Do you ever stop to think? or wonder why?
The nearest thing to Heaven is a child


Daddy how does this thing fly?
A hundred other where's and why's
You really don't know but we try
Thank God for Kids
When you look down in those trustin eyes
That look to you, you realize
Its love that you can't buy
Thank God for Kids


Thank God for there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Do you ever stop to think? or wonder why?
The nearest thing to Heaven is a child


When you get down on your knees tonight
To thank the Lord for his guiding light
And pray they turn out right
Thank God for Kids
Thank God for Kids

When you rolled out of bed and stubbed your toe
And I heard you almost cuss
And I fought back the urge to laugh
Just listen to you fuss
Then you overdid the coffee
Couldn't get your hair just right
When I smiled and said good morning
You looked mad enough to fight

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in a love with too
Yeah, that minivan's a far cry
From the sports car in your dreams
And that dead end job is pushing back
Vacation more, it seems
You got soccer at four-thirty
And ballet class by five
Then I call you talking flirty
You ask have I lost my mind

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too

When you lay down in my arms
Let go of all that stress
Whisper, honey I love you
With your head on my chest
When the world's strongest woman is my lady
When the day is through
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too

If I had to do the things you do
Well, I'd just lose my mind
Somehow you get 'em fed and bathed
And settled down by nine
And I hear you down the hallway
As you're laying down to sleep
And pray the good lord watches
Over them and you and me

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too


We got beer, and a tub
And some good looking girls
Dressed to the nights
Looking for a good time
Jacked up trucks
Stacked in thick
White rocks stuck
In the mud grips
And a big 'ole bouncer at the door
But don't show him your I.D
And don't you dare step out on the floor


If you aren’t here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you aren’t here to party
You'll be missing out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And head your ass back home
If you aren’t here to party


There's a little 'ole Louisiana band
Playing a swampy jam and brown sugar tans
Looking so fine shaken that thing
In the zydeco cage and purple rain
Raise your drink up in the air
And everybody sing along
Man, you're here all alone


If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And carry your ass back home
If you ain't here to party

If you aren’t here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you aren’t here to party
You'll be missing out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and pick someone out
Maybe make out
And get their number in your phone
Man, the only way that you'll be
Going home alone is
If you aren’t here to party


Yeah, you better be here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party


Throw your keys on the bar
You aren’t driven' your car
You're here with me
That's how it's going to be


Cause we're here to party, baby
Yeah, yeah, whoa
If you aren’t here to party
You picked the wrong Friday night


Hey, up in the backwoods, down in the huller
Old boys feeling like a dog on a collar
Keeping that chain pulled tight
Waiting on Saturday night
Put on the smell-good, put on Skynard
Head into to town like a NASCAR winner
Cruising back an' forth to the Tasty-Freeze
Everywhere you look, all you see


Is hillbilly deluxe, slick pick-up trucks
Big timing in a small town
Stirring it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome
To the bone with a little home grown
A country girl cuddled up
Hillbilly deluxe


Yeah, couple cute sweet things driving a fastback
Shoot 'em a cool smile hoping that they smile back
"Hey, Baby, what's you name?"
Burn a little rubber when the red lights change
Here come the blue lights, here come Barney
Hide all the beer, y'all, let's move the party
Gotta go, but that's all right
Do it all again next Friday night




Hey, Mr. DJ, can I make a request?
Somebody I love just up and left
And if I know her, she'll drive all night alone
And she just might have her radio on
Yeah, I pray she has her radio on


Just in case she ain't that far from town
Play somethin' that'll turn her car around
And send it out from a fool who's done her wrong
Hey, she just might have her radio on
Yeah, I pray she has her radio on


Play something that'll get her thinking 'bout me
Let her know I'm really sorry
Something that reaches out in the dark
Weighs on her mind, tugs at her heart


Well, I know you get this all the time
Broken hearts lighting up all the lines
Begging you to play that special song
Hey, but she just might have her radio on
Yeah, I pray she has her radio on


So play her something that'll get her thinking 'bout me
Let her know I'm really sorry
Something that reaches out in the dark
Weighs on her mind and tugs at her heart


I need to make a dedication
Before that late-night signal's faded
Before she drives away too far
And parks that damned old car


Play her something that'll get her thinking 'bout me
Let her know I'm really sorry
Something that reaches out in the dark
Weighs on her mind and tugs at her heart
Tears up her eyes, turns 'round the car


Hey Mr DJ can I make a request?
Somebody I love just up and left


It might be hard to be lovers
But it's harder to be friends
Baby, pull down the covers
It's time you let me in
Maybe light a couple candles
I'll just go ahead and lock the door
If you just talk to me baby


Till we ain't strangers anymore


Lay your head on my pillow
I sit beside you on the bed
Don't you think its time we say
Some things we haven't said
It ain't too late to get back to that place
Back to where, we thought it was before
Why don't you look at me




Sometimes it's hard to love me
Sometimes it's hard to love you too
I know it's hard believing
That love can pull us through
It would be so easy
To live your life

With one foot out the door
Just hold me baby




It's hard to find forgiveness
When we just turn out the light
It's hard to say you're sorry
When you can't tell wrong from right
It would be so easy
To spend your whole damn life
Just keeping score
So let's get down to it baby
There ain't no need to lie

Tell me who you think you see
When you look into my eyes
Lets put our two hearts back together
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor
Make love with me baby




La-a-a-a-a-di-da
La-a-a-a-a-di-da


If I had a dollar every time that I swore you off
And a twenty every time that i picked up when you called
And a crisp new Benjamin for when you're here then gone again
And a dollar every time I was right about you after all


Boy, I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da


If I had a dime every time that you crossed my mind
Well, I'd basically be sitting on a big ass pile of dimes
And all the times that you make my heart feel cheap
I might as well have won the lottery
All of this pain and me cursing your name
Would just turn into dollar signs


'Cause I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da


Told myself I wouldn't do this again
But how much you wanna bet I'mma do this again?


Rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn

No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da


I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da


I must look just like a fool here
In the middle of the road
Standing there in your rear view
And getting soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light


But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
I keep a looking for
The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown


I held on longer than I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time



But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes
Baby just one time
I know there's nothing stopping you now
I'm not asking you to turn back around


I'd settle for a slowdown
Come on just slow down
I'd settle for a slow down


A friend gave me your number
To tell you watch your lover's tracks
See I always kind of liked you
So, I wanna have your back
There is a good chance by the time you hear this
The story's gonna say
That I came on to him
But it was never quite that way


I knew he was good looking
Maybe too good to be true
But when he kissed me in that alley
I could tell there was a you


I don't want to be that girl
With your guy
To fool you
Make you cry
Wreck it all
For one night
To be with him when he should be with you
I don't want all the dirty looks
The headlines
So, I called you
To explain why
I wound up
With your guy
When I don't really wanna be that girl


I know boys can be promiscuous
Yeah, that's just what they do
But this involves the both of us
Yeah, it's our business too
So, I thought I'd call to tell you
It was never in my plan
I'm not the scarlet Devil
I don't want to take your man


Imagine how surprised I was
When he got up to leave
It wasn't my name on his lips
No, he didn't call for me
He didn't say, Jolene


I don't want to be that girl
With your guy
To fool you
Make you cry
Wreck it all
For one night
To be with him when he should be with you
I don't want all the dirty looks
The headlines
So, I called you
To explain why
I wound up
With your guy
When I don't really wanna be that girl


We all know how the moral of the story goes
Be careful what you reap because you reap what you sow
I'm calling cause I really thought you should know
Even though he is that guy


I don't want to be that girl
With your guy
To fool you
Make you cry
Wreck it all
For one night
To be with him when he should be with you
I don't want all the dirty looks
The headlines
So, I called you
To explain why
I wound up
With your guy
When I don't really wanna be that girl

I don't wanna be that girl


New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky


And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive


And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now


‘Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right


Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh


And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

Chestnut hair with just a touch of gray
Shadows of a few more years on her face
That ain't the girl that I knew yesterday
Oh no, now, that's a woman

Up and running at the crack of dawn
There ain't always time to get her make up on
But she's more beautiful without it on
Oh yeah, that's a woman

She's got a grace that I don't understand
She can move mountains with those tender hands
She makes a king out of a common man
Yeah, that's me, lucky me

--- Instrumental ---
Ohh, ohh, oh, oh, yeah

She makes a king out of a common man
Yeah, that's me
Yeah, that's me

In the evening when the kids are down
And I can see she's getting sleepy now
Still she finds some time for me somehow
Oh, now, that's a woman...


And just when I think that I'm about as high as any man could ever go
That's when I look at you and right on cue, your body moves
It's like it's putting on a show, yeah
Got to get to me, you pretty little tease
I just keep, I just keep


Falling for you, baby
You just keep killing me one kiss at a time
Ain't nothing now that's gonna save me
Mmm, your sweet love keeps calling
And I just keep falling


Eye to eye, your skin on mine
You slide your fingers through my hair and tell me "take it slow"
And I know what you want
And so I go down on my knees; I'm here to please
I just keep, I just keep


Falling for you, baby
You just keep killing me one kiss at a time
Ain't nothing now that's gonna save me
Ooh, your sweet love keeps calling
And I just keep falling

It's crazy, baby, what you do to me
There's magic in your kind of gravity
And any fool can see why I keep, I just keep


Falling for you, baby
You just keep killing me one kiss at a time
Ain't nothing now that's gonna save me
Ooh, your sweet love keeps calling
And I just, I just


I just keep falling for you, baby
You just keep killing me one kiss at a time
Ain't nothing now that's gonna save me
Ooh, your sweet love keeps calling
I just, I just keep falling


You know the one where you call
But you act like you never called me
When you see me at a bar
And you act like you never saw me
When you're dancing with him, and you're looking at me
Or I'm holding her, and I'm hoping you see
Or the one where you don't kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me


All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games


The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party
The way you make sure it gets back to me
That you got with somebody
The way you wake up, say it was just a mistake
But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that


All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games


This break-up, make-up,hot and cold thing got me dizzy
You don't want me til I got somebody with me
It's gonna kill me
Baby tell me
What am I supposed to do with you?


And all of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games
All of these games


Right there's the high school
Where we met
We'd sneak out back
For a couple of kisses and a cigarette
And that parking lot
Was our first date
And her momma slammed the door
When I dropped her off too late


She's gone
Chasing that highway wind
She's gone
She ain't coming back again


This ain't nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
These streets are only bringing me down
Got to find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town


We sat down on those
Courthouse steps
Fourth of July
Those fireworks over our heads
And they'd ring the bells
Of that little church
No there ain't nowhere
I can look that doesn't hurt


She's gone
But I still feel her on my skin
She's gone
But she ain't coming back again




I can't erase the memories
And I can't burn the whole place down


No this ain't nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
To hell if I'm sticking around
Got to find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town (Oh, yeah)
Out of this goodbye town
I'm out of this town
So out of this town


Oh oh oh oh oh


You'll be just a memory in the back of my mind
You'll be just a memory, yeah
Oh, somewhere in the back of my mind
In the back of my mind, yeah
One day you're going to look back at what we had
You're going to think of me
You're going to think of me
When I'm long gone
I'll be long gone

Well, my old Uncle Joe, he's a proud Democrat
He's got FDR on his baseball cap
An' thinks the whole country's on a one-way track to hell
He says there's only one truck an' that's a Chevrolet
Everything else is money gone to waste
An' a lot more people oughtta learn to do for themselves
Well, I love how we can disagree
An' we can still be family

Makes me think about Hank
How he played his songs
Made a long-haired pot-smokin' hippy wanna sing along
Makes me think about life an' all it's different roads
There's a million you can pick
But they're all gonna lead you back home
Yeah, we're livin' in some crazy days
We're all crazy in our diff'rent ways
But we can all get along
Without everybody thinkin' the same

We got a big hair preacher on channel nineteen
A Maharaji on sixty-three
An' the good Lord's upstairs, tryin' to get them both on the phone
We got country boy's sayin' that rap just sucks
An' rappers sayin'country's all outta touch
But there's plenty of room for both on my radio
'Cause music ain't right or wrong
So tonight, let's just rock on an' on

Makes me think about Hank
How he played his songs
Made a long-haired pot-smokin' hippy wanna sing along
Makes me think about life an' all it's different roads
There's a million you can pick
But they're all gonna lead you back home
Yeah, we're livin' in some crazy days
We're all crazy in our diff'rent ways
But we can all get along
Without everybody thinkin' the same

(Aw, c'mon, yeah boy.)

Makes me think about life an' all it's different roads
There's a million you can pick
But they're all gonna lead you back home
Yeah, we're livin' in some crazy days
We're all crazy in our diff'rent ways
But we can all get along
Without everybody thinkin' the same
Yeah, the more things change
The more they stay the same
Makes me think about ol' Hank...


It's like a storm
That cuts a path
It breaks your will
It feels like that

You think you're lost
But you're not lost on your own
You're not alone


I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
If you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go


It hurts my heart
To see you cry
I know it's dark
This part of life
Oh it finds us all
And we're too small
To stop the rain
Oh but when it rains




And I won't let you fall
Don't be afraid to fall
I'm right here to catch you
I won't let you down
It won't get you down
You're going to make it
Yeah I know you can make it


Because I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
And I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go
Oh I'm going to hold you
And I won't let go
Won't let you go
No I won't

I was raised on the Bible and the belt
Taught to say "Yes sir" and "Yes ma'am"
Say the grace before you eat, bow your head
And take off your hat, I still believe in that

When neighbors weren't just neighbors, they were friends
You could count on them through thick and thin
To help chop the wood, cut the grass
Give you the shirt right off their back, I still believe in that

When a handshake and your word
Was better than any piece of paper
And you made an honest living
From the fruits of your labor

When we all prayed to Jesus
And we all pledged our allegiance to the flag
I still believe in that

Yeah, our heroes and our idols were homegrown
Didn't find them on no TV show
They were our teachers and our preachers
Our soldiers, moms and dads, I still believe in that

When a handshake and your word
Was better than any piece of paper
And you made an honest living
From the fruits of your labor

When we all prayed to Jesus
We all pledged our allegiance to the flag
I still believe in that

No, I don't know where we're going
Or when we got off track
But there's a lot that we could learn from the past
I still believe in that, I still believe in that

I was raised on the Bible and the belt
Taught to say "Yes sir" and "Yes ma'am"
I still believe in that, I still believe in that
I still believe in that

Oh, I was kicked back in a rented cabana
Easin' my mind with some old Carlos Santana
Nibblin' on banana moon pie
When I swore I saw an angel from Heaven floatin' by
Then I thought: "No, no way: she must be from around here."
She got one of those tans you just know she wears all year
Swayin', sashayin', flip-floppin' along
Like wherever she may be is right where she belongs

An' I thought: "Oooh, I love the local girls."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
"I love the local girls
"Lo, lo, local; lo, lo, local; lo, lo, local girls."

I said: "Madam, if you have nowhere to go
"Can I interest you in an ice-cold Pacifico?"
An' she said: "As luck would have it
"I got nothin' but time,"
She reached in her back-pack
Said: "Down here you'll find
"That a lady don't leave home
"Without a couple of limes."

An' I said: "Oooh, I love the local girls."
"Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
"I love the local girls
"Lo, lo, local; lo, lo, local; lo, lo, local girls."

Later on she took me to this bar built out of cinder blocks
One of those joints with a notice to shell park in line
While we were dancin', she whispered: "I like you a lot."
An' I said: "My, my, my, go on: say that one more time."

Five years later, here I am intermittent
With a couple a-toaheads as that big ol' orange sun is settin'
I can't believe how good it's stuill gettin'
As I watch my daughters splashin' in the water

An' I thought: "Oooh, I love the local girls."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
"I love the local girls
(Here she come, now.)
"Lo, lo, local; (Hey.)
"Lo, lo, local; (Here she come, now.)
"Lo, lo, local girls
"Lo, lo, local; (Ooh.)
"Lo, lo, local; (Whoo.)
I love the local girls
"Lo, lo, local; lo, lo, local;
I love the local girls
I love the local girls
I love the local girls...

She got her smile on, dog'on nothing in the world's wrong
Rolling down a country road
She's my shotgun rider
I'm the lucky dog beside her
My lips are where her kisses go
She loves when we go to the river and get in the water
And buddy she is hotter than south Georgia in July
Man when I'm with her I can't get enough of her
I got to kiss her and I got to hug her
And brother she's mine all mine

This ole boy got it going on
Got the good lord smiling on me
Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine
Got me buzzin' like a bee
She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder
Nobody else get's to hold her
But this ole boy

We're in my old ford oh lord
Holes in my floor board
But she don't seem to mind
We park in a hay field
Fog up the windshield
My kind of killing time
She sweetens my tea and she butters my biscuit
I am who I am and buddy she gets it
I ain't got to change a thing
And I don't know if it could get any better
But man if it does then i reckon i better get to picking out a ring

This ole boy got it going on
Got the good lord smiling on me
Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine
Got me buzzin' like a bee
She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder
Nobody else get's to hold her
But this ole boy

Yeah, this ole boy got it going on
Got the good lord smiling on me
Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine
Got me buzzin' like a bee
She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder
Nobody else get's to hold her
But this ole boy

Yeah this ole boy
Nobody but this ole boy
This ole boy


All my life I've been searching
All my life I've been uncertain
I been abandoned and left alone
At fifteen I had to leave home
The black sheep, the bad seed


At a roadside bar in Tennessee
I met an angel to rescue me
She rescued me
She wore blue jeans and a rosary
Believed in God and believed in me
All her friends think she's a little crazy
She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve
Don't give a damn what the world thinks of me
She tells me it's all good
She's happy with a bad seed
Happy to be misunderstood


Two packs and a pint a day
To hide the shame
And wash away the pain
All the pain
Every road was a dead-end street
Running from the law
And running on empty
You couldn't shake the marks that were left on me

At a roadside bar in Tennessee
I met an angel to rescue me
She rescued me


She wore blue jeans and a rosary
Believed in God and believed in me
All her friends think she's a little crazy
She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve
Don't give a damn what the world thinks of me
She tells me it's all good
She's happy with a bad seed
Happy to be misunderstood


Misunderstood
Misunderstood

Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya


Wheels rolling on an old Toyota
Twist top on a Sunkist soda
Your brown hair in the west coast wind

We step out on the dance floor the band starts to play
Holding you close I get carried away
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you

Time's standing still as I Whirl you around
We're dancing without even touching the ground
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you

No words are spoken
None need to be said
You and the music
Have gone to my head

But I'll just go on when the music is through
Lost in the feeling with you
Lost in the feeling with you
Lost in the feeling with you


Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern
Or in a honky-tonk
Or on a four-wheel-drive tailgate

Oh, I've got posters on my wall
Of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait
Some people look down on me
But I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard
With a baby on my hip


Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"

And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
(Hell yeah!)


Victoria's Secret
Well, their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing
On a Walmart shelf half-price
And still look sexy (sexy)
Just as sexy as those models on TV

No, I don't need no designer tag
To make my man want me
You may think I'm trashy
A little too hard core
But in my neck of the woods
I'm just the girl next door


Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"

And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
(Hell yeah!)


I'm a redneck woman

And I know all the words to every Ol' Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls
Like me


(Hell yeah!)
Hell yeah!

What do you say girl, we do something crazy
Quit putting it off, you know what I'm saying
Ain't like it ain't going to happen, forever's a given
It's already written
Who we kidding baby, come on

The stars can't line up any straighter
Let's do it now and think about it later


Why wait another minute
For something we should'a done yesterday?
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait


Now I love your mama, let's save her some trouble
And your daddy won't mind if we save him a bundle
Girl it just so happens, that ring that you wanted
Well guess what I bought it
It's in my pocket baby, come on

Let's get it done, let's get it on your left hand
This is me, girl, popping the question



Let's do something crazy
Because crazy's what you make me




What do you say girl we do something crazy


Lord have mercy here she comes
Behind the wheel of a pickup truck
Mudd slingin', she's singin'
Country girl just doin her thing and
Ain't nothing like a backwoods baby
Drive my tractor drive me crazy
Likes huntin', loves fishin'
And she can hold her own in the kitchen
And by the way boys did I mention


She's pretty as a field of daisies
She's sweeter than watermelon wine
Way hotter than the Alabama asphalt
And when I get her in these arms of mine
Lord have mercy I love her kisses
Man I can't get enough
Kinda like chicken and biscuits


She can rock them high heel shoes
But she'd rather where cowboy boots
Cut off jeans and a baseball hat
Them city girls can't do it like that
Off the chain on a Friday night
Dancin' and drinkin' ain't scared to fight
But Sunday mornin' comes rollin' 'round
In the choir is where she's found
Y'all makes me so proud
'Cause there ain't no doubt


She's pretty as a field of daisies
She's sweeter than watermelon wine
Way hotter than the Alabama asphalt
And when I get her in these arms of mine
Lord have mercy I love her kisses
Man I can't get enough
Kinda like chicken and biscuits


(Hey)
Hey sweet thing let me hold you close
(Ohh)
Tthere's something that you need to know
(Hey)
When it comes to lovin' you
(Ohh)
There ain't nothin' that I'd rather do


She's pretty as a field of daisies
She's sweeter than watermelon wine
Way hotter than the Alabama asphalt
And when I get her in these arms of mine
Lord have mercy I love her kisses
Man I can't get enough
Kinda like chicken and biscuits


My mama mapped out the road that she knows
Which hands you shake and which hands you hold
In my hand-me-down mercury, ready to roll
She knew that i had to go
And hang out, make lots of noise
And lay out late with a boy
Make the mistakes that she made 'cause she knew all along


I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on


They say the first time won't ever last
But that didn't stop me. The first time he laughed
All my friends tried to warn me the day that we met
"Girl, don't you lose your heart yet"
But his dark eyes dared me with danger
And sparks fly like flame to a paper
Fire in his touch burning me up, but still i held on




The last time i saw him, we packed up my things
And he smiled like the first time he told me his name
And we cried with each other
We split the blame for the parts that we couldn't change
Pictures, dishes and socks
It's our whole life down to one box there he was waving goodbye on the front porch alone


But i was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Hang out, make lots of noise
And lay out late with a boy
Make the mistakes that she made, life is a runaway train
His dark eyes dared me with danger
And sparks fly like flame to a paper, fire in his touch
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on


I been hanging round this place, I been looking through your space
I been waiting' for you, I've been waiting' for you
All the places that you go, all the people that you know
I've been looking for you, I've been looking for you


And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got something in their pockets, all got something on their face
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard
Singing' hallelujah while they dance over the stars
They all say they're going' far


Me I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long


Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night looking for your footprints in the sand
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song
Were you even here at all?


Me I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long


Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say
And if you ever were here baby they ain't giving' you away


Now it's been two days
I'm still looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long


And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got something in their pockets, all got something on their face

Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night looking for your footprints in the sand


Think I'll go back to the city, back to El Cerrito Place
That's the last time that I saw that pretty smile upon your face
I've been looking for you baby


I had a hundred dollar ring in my hand
So weak and tired I could barely stand
From being up all night, praying she'd say yes
So with a hopeful heart I hit one knee
With a tear in her eye she looked at me
It was the moment of truth, I was scared to death
My life hung on what that tear meant
Then she smiled at me
And I lost it


No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like the curse that is the cure
Better or worse one thing's for sure
It's real love
And I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it


Well the honeymoon ended and life began
Jobs and bills losing touch with friends
And that apartment it got smaller everyday
Then one night the walls finally closed in
I came home late, She said, "Where've you been
You used to call and tell me you were on your way"
She said, "If this is how it's gonna be, then I quit"
Then she walked out the door
I lost it


No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like the curse that is the cure
Better or worse one thing's for sure
It's real love
And I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it


I picked myself up off the floor
She walked back through the door
We made love like it was the first time


No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad like she does
It's like the curse that is the cure
Better or worse one thing's for sure
It's real love
And I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it
Oh, if I lost it (if I lost it)
I don't wanna lose it


You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler than the flip-side of my pillow,  that's right
Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay (yeah, it's okay)
And the moments when my good times start to fade


You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile


Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that


[You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night]
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Your eyes have been a different kind of blue
I can feel the sadness when I'm touching you
It's as if lately you've been standing in sinkin sand
Before you go down any deeper
Let me help, take my hand

I want my baby back
I miss the way you used to laugh
And dance around to your own beat
So alive so carefree
I want my baby back
Where is the old you hiding at
You may be here, but baby
You've been gone to long

Girl, you're in a state I've never seen you in
It breaks my heart to see you in a downward spin
You're looking lost but you don't have to be alone
Why don't you talk to me
Tell me what's going on

I want my baby back
I miss the way you used to laugh
And dance around to your own beat
So alive so carefree
I want my baby back
Where is the old you hiding at
You may be here, but baby
You've been gone to long

I want to see that crazy smile
Like you just might do something wild
There it is, here it comes
Just in time you could use a little fun

I want my baby back
I miss the way you used to laugh
And dance around to your own beat
So alive, so carefree
I want my baby back
Where is the old you hiding at
You may be here, but baby
You've been gone to long

I want my, baby back

I want my, baby back

Oh, bring her back

I want my, baby back...


She was like a brand new song on an old guitar
Supernova in a Mason jar
Every boy in town wanted to show her around
As a dirt road, fence row, kudzu king
Beating along this American dream
Wrecked out the truck when she showed up
She had a fire inside her faraway eyes
And I knew just where to take her that night


And we got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights


She's like a broken heart you can't wait to have
A shooting star that falls too fast
Try holding on, it's already gone
I searched that radio low and high
Tryin' to find a song to make a memory by
And I did alright, for a small town guy
But even in my arms I knew
I'd never shine as bright as her city lights do


We got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights

We got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge
And when the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights
She's city lights

She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights


If you like a man who
You can put your trust in
You don't have to worry
Where he's been
Then rest easy
Girl, you're gonna love me


And if you like to slow dance
To ol' Keith Whitley
Long Sunday drives out
In the country
I'm your cup of tea
Girl, you're gonna love me


Come and rest your head against my chest
'Cause I'm the one for you
You don't have to look no more
Your search is through


So girl if you like a handful
Of fresh wild flowers
A back rub on a bad day
Talkin' for hours
I'm good company
Girl you're gonna love me


Come and rest your head against my chest
'Cause I'm the one for you
You don't have to look no more
Your search is through


So girl if you like a big heart
That's in this for the long haul
Till we're rockin' on the front porch
And they're callin' me papaw
Till the last breath you breathe
Girl you're gonna love me


Just try it and see
Girl you're gonna love me

My daddy said just come home
I might as well come back to your own
You go out wanderin every night
You act a fool it just ain't right
I'll tell ya what
Well theres just one thing that pop don't understand
It's like catching bolts of lighting in your hand

A woman needs, to beleive
She can take the road she's never known
A woman needs a few second chances
A little room for dancing, all night long

Mama says she understands
Theres ust some things you can't tell to a man
I remember way back when
Wild and free it ain't no sin
Ill tell ya what, well the wind
Will figure out which way its blowin'
So it ain't no thing to not know where im goin'

A woman needs, to beleive
She can take the road she's never known
A woman needs a few second chances
A little room for dancing, all night long

Yeahhhh, ohh
A woman needs, to beleive
She can take the road she's never known
A woman needs a few second chances
A little room for dancing, all night long

A woman needs, to beleive
She can make her mind up on her own
A woman needs a few second chances
Sweet romancin
A little room for dancin, all night long

Lets run away, where nothing stands between me and you
Lets find a place, somewhere a little closer to a dream
And call it a home, where there's no right and there's no wrong
And we can be all alone

And i'll take off my halo, if you take off your wings
You dont have to be invincible cause i sure ain't no saint
You'll always be my angel no matter what you do
Cause you take me to heaven, just by bein you

Tell me a secret, tell me things that no one else should know
Even in your weakness, baby drop your guard, just let it go
Until everything explodes, and you dont have to feel ashamed
Baby just say my name

And i'll take off my halo, if you take off your wings
You dont have to be invincible cause i sure ain't no saint
You'll always be my angel no matter what you do
Cause you take me to heaven, just by bein you

When i see you standin there, you know it all becomes so clear
The way you look, the way you touch
I need the way you lift me up
This will never feel complete until there's nothing in between
And we have broke down every wall
Baby baby baby lets just fall

And i'll take off my halo, yeah and i'll take off my wings
You dont have to be invincible cause i sure ain't no saint
You'll always be my angel no matter what you do
Cause you take me to heaven, just by bein you
Oh you take me to heaven, just by bein you

Lets run away
Lets run away

You can settle down in Mexico
Runaway join a circus show
Whatever baby it's alright with me
Take a walk in the pouring rain
Sky dive from a jet airplane
Love like ours is all about being free

There's two chairs on the front porch
One's yours and one is mine
Four wheels in the driveway
That'll take us across the line

It doesn't really matter
If you wanna rock or roll
Just take me with you
When you go

Swim the ocean for a million pearls
Hitchhike all the way around the world
Fly to the moon in a rocketship, I don't care
Ride a camel cross the desert sand
Aail away to never, never land
Imagination can take you anywhere

So be the hero that rides off into the sun
Or a wild raging river always on the run
Change direction like the strong four winds that blow
Just take me with you when you go

Today, tomorrow and forever
Every turn you make
I want to be there
I want to be there

Live like a gypsy chase your distant dreams
Or get lost in the blues on Bourbon Street down in New Orleans
Believe in heaven if you want to save your soul
Just take me with you when you go
Just take me with you when you go...


When your heart is all alone every second
Seems so long
When it's just you, you can't see through
Those old clouds that rain so blue


But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you


When it's late, the sun hangs low
By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone




So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
At being on our own




The way I love you
The way I love you

My love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

There's only so many stars in the night
That can make up a milky way
And there ain't more
Than twenty four long hours in a day

But they say everything has a limit
That ain't exactly true
'Cause there ain't a limit to the love in my heart
Or the way that I feel about you

Even when the pyramids are gone
My love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

Well, I got two hundred thousand miles
On a rusty old beat up truck
And I hate to say but there's gonna come a day
When I'm gonna have to give her up

But darlin' since I met you
Well, here is how it is
I could live with losing everything
But I would die without your kiss

So if you think this fire we lit inside
Will burn out, you're wrong
My love goes on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on

I know that we can't spend
Every waking hour together
But I can hold you for tonight
And I can love you forever

Every time I think of what we've got
All I do is smile
'Cause the beginning to the end of time
Compared to this is a little while

I've heard raindrops'll turn into oceans
And oceans'll turn to dust
But there ain't a single force in the world
That'll have an effect on us

But that may be that the rocky
Rocky mountains don't last long
But my love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

On and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on gets on

Baby blue staring in the window pane just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she’s got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress, now her heart’s a mess
Praying  she will find a way to make it

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Searching for a sign in the night, even like a lonely string of lights
That’ll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road’s been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There’s more to this than just the breath you’re breathing

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

On The Way Down

You won’t forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath
And fly

Keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Ohh-oh, oh-oh
Fly
Fly


Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me?
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning?
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working?
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning?
Cause it's still burning


So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy


If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone please don't call me
And say you miss me, no


So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy


Woah
Oh have mercy


If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mmmh if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh have mercy
Oh have mercy
Have mercy

Golden Tee, shuffleboard, pinball, he's got the score
That everybody around here's tryin to beat
He's a six pack up when he walks in
Tells the band crank it up to 10
Then he's up dancin on his seat
Well he's a big mouth, yellin' hey play some free bird
Says give me three steps and nobody gets hurt
Then he takes off his shirt


There's one in every crowd
Brings the party in us out
Good time Charley with a Harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

Got a fliptop box of Marlboros
He'll bum a light and steal your girl
Then laugh at you for gettin' all upset, well everybody here knows his name
Makes everybody else look sane
When he's out, as far as you can get
In his mind he's a rock star, crankin' out that air guitar
Til the bartender says fool, get off my bar


There's one in every crowd
That brings the party in us out
Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

He's a hard drinkin man's man
And women love him when they can
He's a bartender's best friend
It ain't a party till he walks in


There's one in every crowd
That brings the party in us out
Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

It's usually me, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd, that's right

Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy - won't you look down over me
Cause I got a first-class ticket
And I'm blue as a boy can be

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Saw the ghost of Elvis
Down on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
And watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
There's a pretty little thing
Waitin' on "The King"
Down in the Jungle Room

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
You got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel plays the piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said
"Tell me are you a Christian"
And I said "Ma'am I am tonight"

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Walking in Memphis


Well, I’ve been living like a wild ol’ mustang
Out in Montana fields
Might’a earned me a bad reputation
But never stopped these wheels
From going and rolling too far
Running and gunning a little too hard
So un-reigned, so untamed, yeah


So God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you


Your soul is pure golden
Must’ve been true love you were grown in
Sent the sun rays to a dark place
On the same day, yeah, God made


God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you
More girls like you


It’s been a while since I stopped and prayed
But Lord have mercy look at her
He sure didn’t make no mistake when he put that angel on Earth
Yeah, God made …


God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you

First time i felt it
I think I was five years old
I was scared, had a nightmare
Mama was there for me to hold

Daddy he was different
He never said it much
But I heard him loud and clear
When he brought home that ball and glove

And it took on a brand new meaning
I wasn't just a boy no more
When she moved in next door...

Where you from?
What's your name?
Wanna go to my game?
Got the keys to my dad's old truck
Turn the radio on
Still remember the song
We held hands and there it was
Love....

The page just kept on turning
There i was with someone else
First time in my life time
I wasn't livin for myself

I knew i wasn't fallin
Anywhere I fell before
This place was different
It was deeper it was more...
Then it took on a brand new meaning
Yeah it was strong and it was true
Knew what I had to do...

Found a ring
Hit my knees
Couldn't talk
Couldn't breathe...
My heart had me all choked up
Said "I do,"
As we cried
Wedding bells
Waved good bye
The whole church knew it was
Love....

Then it took on a brand new meaning
When the docter said "It's time to watch your miracle arrive."

Thank the Lord
Cut the cord
Take her home
Help her grow
And complete the circle of
Love......


That anchorman
Says they're fighting again somewhere in the Middle East
The world prays for peace
There's a single mom
Just got laid off went and lost her job to some foreign hands
In some far away land


Last night in Oklahoma, some twister took thirteen
And they're prayin', they find the missin' three
God must be busy


That highway sign
Went from slow ahead to traffic's dead
Thought it couldn't get worse
Then that Amber alert
They say she's four, Colorado plates, headed out of state in a Chevy van
It's hard to understand


You can see it in the faces, of all those highway strangers
They're prayin' that God keeps girl from danger
God must be busy


And I know in the big picture, I'm just a speck of sand
And God's got better things to do, than to look out for one man
I know He's heard my prayers, 'cause He hears everything
He just ain't answered back, or He'd bring you back to me
God must be busy


That evenin' news
Ain't much changed, pretty much the same since I left home
Yeah, that war's still on
They found that little girl
She was soaking wet, half scared to death on the side of some road
Them prayers work you know


And the blood and the crips are at it, and there's a killer drought down south
And old folks can't afford the drugs, they can't live without
God must be busy


And I know in the big picture, I'm just a speck of sand
And God's got better things to do, than to look out for one man
I know He's heard my prayers, 'cause He hears everything
He just ain't answered back, or He'd bring you back to me
God must be busy


That anchorman
Says the fightin's worse, cities burn in the Middle East
The world prays for peace


Saturday night seeing you out
Pulling you in you're looking around
The look in your eyes I've already found
Why you're so on edge and figuring it out
What makes you tick? What makes you hot?
What did he throw in the boat to make it rock?
So many questions on why and why not
But on second thought

{Chorus]
These hands were made to hold you
And I wanna get to showin' you
Can't believe the things you've been through
Issues. Trusted him to stick with you
Now close your eyes while I kiss you 'cause I know
These hands were made to hold you
Hold you


Baby I'm down for taking it slow
We'll go as fast as you wanna go
And when the time's right
And you feel like
Sugar let me know
What did he say?
What did he do?
Why don't you put it on me?
What'd he put you through?
Tell me your story
Forget it, let's get onto me and you
And these hands have wanna


Hold you
And I wanna get to showin' you
Can't believe the things you've been through
Issues. Trusted him to stick with you
Now close your eyes while I kiss you 'cause I know
These hands were made to hold you
Hold you


These hands were made to hold you
I wanna get to showin' you
Can't believe the things you've been through
Issues. Trusted him to stick with you
Now close your eyes while I kiss you 'cause I know
These hands were made to hold you
These hands were made to hold you
These hands were made to hold you
These hands were made to hold you
These hands were made to hold you


Everybody down in Houston calls him "Texas"
Everybody way up North calls him "Cornbread"
You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him "baby"
Daddy called him "boy", his friends call him "crazy"


Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting, and the high, and the heat
And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him "whiskey"


Warm my body to the core just like a blanket
His face was so sweet then he took my breath away
Hit me so hard like a rock through a window
I knew I was in trouble from the moment I met you, boy


Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting, and the high, and the heat
And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him "whiskey"


Now the numb has set in
He's gone like the wind
And I can barely feel the pain


Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting, and the high, and the heat
And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him "whiskey"
I shoulda just called him "whiskey"
I shoulda just called him "whiskey"


All we need is a July hot Saturday night
A couple cans all cool and the needle on full and a countryside
Yeah, a hot little playlist, of your favorite songs
When I get you climbing up in the cab of this truck
Yeah you know it's on, know it's on


Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night


So give me that aw yeah, and take me there look
I'm a sucker for your kiss, wanna steal 'em from your lips baby, like a truck
Foot heavy on the floorboard, everywhere we go
I'm talking once in a lifetime, blowing your mind
Burning down these back roads


Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night




So give me that aw yeah, and I'll give you that all night
Girl, give me that let's go, and I'll give you that good good time


Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night


Yeah, a once in a lifetime night
Ooh girl, looking down the ride of one hell of a night
I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

It's been a year since last weekend when you swung by with an old friend
Carried out our future box by box
Stack of mail a tube of toothpaste
An empty zeppelin three cd case
Still a few things here that you forgot
They're just a bad excuse
Just something I can use
To call you

Come on over
Drink my wine
Waste my candles
Waste my time
Tell me lies I won't believe
Just don't wake me when you leave
Come on over
Kick me to the ground
Kiss me when I'm down

The bar you're in sounds like it's crowded
People laughin' people shouting
Where you gonna go at closing time
Just pay your tab
And I'll pay your cab
If you want to

Come on over
Drink my wine
Waste my candles
Waste my time
Tell me lies I won't believe
Just don't wake me when you leave
Come on over
Kick me to the ground
Kiss me when I'm down

Just an hour or two
Is better than none of you
I miss you

Come on over
Drink my wine
Waste my candles
Waste my time
Tell me lies I won't believe
Just don't wake me when you leave
Come on over
Kick me to the ground
Kiss me when I'm down
Kiss me when I'm down


Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends


I'm looking' down the barrel of Friday night
Riding' on a river of freeway lights
Goodbye city I'm country bound
Till Monday rolls around


Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends


Working in the grind is an uphill road
Punching that clock and carrying that load
I bust it all week and then I'm free
The weekend belongs to me


Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends


Give me some fresh air give me that farm
Give me some time with you in my arms
Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise


Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends


Where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends


He had plastic bags wrapped 'round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashin' 5 below
It was freezing rain and spittin' snow
He was curled up behind some garbage cans


I was afraid that he was dead, I gave him a gentle shake
When he opened up his eyes, I said, "Old man are you OK?"


He said, "I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
'Cause I was almost home"


Then he said, "I's just comin' 'round the barn
'Bout the time you grabbed my arm
When I heard mama holler, "Son, hurry up"
I was close enough for my old nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck


Cane poles on the tailgate, bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '55, that's as close as I've been"


"Yeah, I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man, I wish you'd just left me alone
I was almost home"


I said ,"Old man you're gonna freeze to death
Let me drive you to the mission"
He said, "Boy, if you'd've left me alone
Right now I'd be fishin'"


"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man, I wish you'd just left me alone
'Cause I was almost home" (Almost home)


Man I wish you'd just left me alone
I was almost home

Written by Kip Raines and Jeffrey Steele

Well, Grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar, blue collar of a man
He came from the school where you didn't need nothin'
If you couldn't make it with your own two hands
He was backwoods, backwards, used words like:
"No Sir," "Yes, Ma'am," "By God," "Be darned,"
"Hell yeah, I'm American."
In all the years he walked this earth
I swear all he did was work
He said: "The devil dreams on an idle horse
"So you listen to me squirt

"Don't get too high on the bottle
And get right with the Man
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can. "

Now Granny said: "Sonny, stick to your ganas
If you believe in something, no matter what
'Cause it's better to be hated for who you are
Than be loved for who you're not. "
She was five feet of concrete
New York born an' raised on a slick city street
She'd cold-stare you down, stand her ground
Still kickin' and screamin' at 93
I remember just how frail she looked in that hospital bed:
Takin' her last few breaths of life, smilin' as she said:

"Don't get too high on the bottle
Just a little sip ev'ry now and then
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can
And get right with the Man. "

Instrumental Break
(C'mon now.)

"I never let a cowboy make the coffee."
Yeah, that's what Granny always said to my Grandad
And he'd say: "Never tell a joke that ain't that funny more than once."
And "if you wanna hear God laugh, tell Him your plans."

"Don't get too high on the bottle
Get right with the Man, son
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can
And get right with the Man. "

Yeah
(Get too high.)
(Help somebody if you can.)

Babysitter said seven
She's fifteen minutes late
Jimmy's still playing in the bath
Cold macaroni on his plate
And I still haven't done my hair
I hate doin' my hair
It never comes out right

I must have changed my clothes
A half a dozen times
Ended up in this little black dress
I had to mend the hemline
And now I can't find my shoes
I can never find my shoes
God I hate this

Am I nervous?
Am I scared?
Is it worth it?
Should I even care?
What a tine to have these second thoughts
Man I like this guy
I really like him a lot

(Please let him be the right one)
Everything that I've been waiting for
(Please let him be the right one)
And all I've been praying for
(Please, please let him be the right one)
Let him be the dad, the friend, the man
(Please let him be the right one)
Let him cherish me for who I am
(Please let him be the right one)
Let him be the right one

Made it through dinner
Had a little too much wine
Probably talked too much
Went on and on about that little boy of mine
But he smiled, yeah he really smiled
I can't believe he smiled

Oh what a perfect night this has been
Should I say good-bye
Should I let him in
Calm down girl it's just a kiss
I know, I know, but it's been so long
Since I felt like this

(Please let him be the right one)
Everything that I've been waiting for
(Please let him be the right one)
And all I've been praying for
(Please, please let him be the right one)
Let him be the dad, the friend, the man
(Please let him be the right one)
Let him cherish me for who I am
(Please let him be the right one)
Let him be the right one

(Please let him be the right one)
Let him be the right one
(Please let him be the right one)
Everything that I've been waiting for
(Please let him be the right one)
And all I've been praying for
Let him be the right one
Let him be the right one

Bobby wants a ten-speed English racer
Jenny wants that fuzzy teddy-bear
Now your asking me what I'd like from Santa
For Christmas this year
There's a lot of things you could buy for me
But they wouldn't mean as much as you standing by that tree

Just put a ribbon in your hair darlin'
You'll be the best gift anywhere Christmas mornin'
There's no worldly treasure I'd like any better
Than you standin' there
Just put a ribbon in your hair

Colored boxes filled with fancy presents
They were mighty pretty sight it's true
But all those pretty things they just can't compare
To the beauty in you
Girl on Christmas day the greatest gift I know
Will be having you to hold underneath the mistletoe

Just put a ribbon in your hair darlin'
You'll be the best gift anywhere Christmas mornin'
There's no worldly treasure I'd like any better
Than you standin' there
Just put a ribbon in your hair

(Oohhh, baby)

This ain't no temporary, typical, tearful goodbye
This ain't no breakin' up, then wakin' up and makin' up one more time
This is gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone

Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone
She's gone!

This ain't no 'give it time, I'm hurtin' but maybe we can work it out'
Won't be no champagne, red rose, romance, second chance
This is gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone

Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone
She's gone!

This is gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone (gone)
She's gone (gone)
She's gone (gone)
She's gone!

She's gone!
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone

Long gone, don't be wrong, never comin' back, my baby's gone
She's gone
Wanna get home, sittin' alone, so pack your bags, and now she's gone
Never comin' back, she's gone
No, no, never
No, no, never
No, no, never
No, no, never comin' back
No, no, never
No, no, never comin' back


Well, I didn't know me, like I know me now
Sometimes you gotta get lost so you can get found
I've been scared of the dark
I've been scared of the light
But if you never get knocked down, you'll never learn how to fight


Imagine all of the dreams you're too scared to chase
You spend every last tomorrow looking back on yesterday
I've been where you are so many times before
These are moments when you find what you've been living for


This is where you fall
This is when you get up
This is where it all begins
This is where it hurts
This is when you learn that
This is where it all begins
Where it all begins


My Momma used to say when I was just a child
"Life's little ups and downs make it all worth the while"
Oh don't worry 'bout nobody cause nobody's keeping score
Yeah, your hardest days are a part of something so much more


This is where you fall
This is when you get up
This is where it all begins
This is where it hurts
This is when you learn that
This is where it all begins
Where it all begins


Starting over is a beautiful thing
You find out who you are through the pain


This is where you fall
This is when you get up
It's where it all begins
Where it all begins
It's where it hurts
This is when you learn that
This is where it all begins
Where it all begins
This is where it hurts
Where it all begins
Where it all begins


Oh, come ye
O come ye O come ye to bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels


O come let us adore him, o come let us adore him
Christ the lord


Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens
Of heaven above
Glory to god
Glory in the highest




Yea, lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus
To thee be glory given
Word of the father
Now in flesh appearing




The sun still hangin' in the sky
And the world is wide awake outside
And I know there's things we need to do
But I just wanna draw the blinds and...


Say goodnight
Oh won't you let me pull you into me
Go wherever all these kisses lead
Turn down the bed
Turn out the lights
And say goodnight


What's the point of trying to pretend
That we don't wanna just give in
Why are we holdin' onto this day
Let's just let it fade away and...


Say goodnight
Oh won't you let me pull you into me
Go wherever all these kisses lead
Turn down the bed
Turn out the lights
And say goodnight


Baby I don't want to wait
I just wanna hear you say
Goodnight
Oh won't you let me pull you into me
Oh go wherever all these kisses lead
Turn down the bed
Turn out the lights
And say goodnight
Say goodnight


Work, work all week long
Punching that clock from dusk till dawn
Counting the days till Friday night
That's when all the conditions are right
For a good time
I need a good time


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


I cashed my check, cleaned my truck
Put on my hat, forgot about work
Sun going down, head across town
Pick up my baby and turn it around
Good time
Ahh, I need a good time


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


Pig in the ground, beer on ice
Just like ole Hank taught us about
Singing along, Bocephus songs
Rowdy friends, all night long
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
Whew!


Heel toe, do-si-do
Scooting our boots, swinging doors
B & D, Kix and Dunn
Honking tonk heaven, Double shotgun
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time
Cause


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


Shot of Tequila, beer on tap
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
G with an O, O with a D
T with an I and an M and an E
And a good time
Shhheww, good time


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


Ahh, turn it up now!
A shot of Tequila
Beer on tap
A good looking woman
To set on my lap
A G with an O, an O with a D
A T with an I an M with an E
That spells good time
A good time
Ohh


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


Twelve o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock four
Five o'clock we know we're that's going to go
Closing the door, shutting them down
Head for that Waffle House way across town
Good time?
Ohh, we're having a good time
Ohh


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


Ohh, yea, a good time
I need a good time
Yea, a good time




The joke's on me and it ain't funny
Everybody but me could see the punch line coming
A mile away
I've heard it so many times I can tell it
To the T, believe me I could sell it
All day
It goes...


A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar


I'd laugh too if my heart would let me
Keeping it light will probably help to get me
Over you
I'm walking, talking, drinking proof
A cliché in a corner booth
Ain't nothing new


A guy walks into a bar](5105628), orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar




A guy walks into a bar](5105628), orders a drink

They fall for each other and end up lovers

Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

Muscles and money riding into the sun
Everybody wants fifteen minutes, to play every game and win it
Feel like McGwire hitting sixty-two homeruns
Do you feel like all that matters, is bigger, better faster
And you wonder if you really measure up
Well I do, and I will
Keep trying but still
Sometimes I need to be reminded who I truly am

I'm a brother, I'm a father, I'm a husband, I'm a son
A man who's work can not be measured just by work his hands have done
I'm a dreamer, I'm a lover, I'm a fighter, I'm a friend
And I'm doing the best I can
To be a modern man

You say you want man who's gentle, understanding and sentimental
Someone strong enough to let you be you
Lord knows baby I keep trying, and you know that I'd be lying
To say it's easy what I'm going through
But I do and for you
I'll keep trying but still
Sometimes I need to be reminded that you know who I am

I'm a brother, I'm a father, I'm a husband, I'm a son
A man who's work can not be measured just by work his hands have done
I'm a dreamer, I'm a lover, I'm a fighter, I'm a friend
And I'm doing the best I can
To be a modern man

I don't have all the answers but I've got a plan
Yeah I'm gonna love you and be who I am (oh who I am)

I'm a brother, I'm a father, I'm your husband, I'm a son
A man who's work can not be measured just by work his hands have done
I'm a dreamer, I'm a lover, I'm a fighter, I'm a friend
And I'm doing the best I can
To be a modern man

I'm a modern man

Got a new Toyota
Traded in the hatchback
Can't make the payment
But I'm not worried 'bout that
Cause I'm bulletproof

Went and got my hair cut
Got a tattoo
Nothin' lady-like
Wasn't even thinkin' 'bout you
Cause I'm bulletproof

Well I could stand in the middle of a thunderstorm
Holding a lightning rod on your roof
This could never shatter me
Don't smother me with sympathy
What makes you think I'm not over you?
Oh, I'm bulletproof

Gonna learn to drink me, some tequila
Light up a Marlboro Red
Dance myself brand new
In my high heels shoes

Well I could stand in the middle of a thunderstorm
Holding a lightning rod on your roof

This could never shatter me
Don't smother me with sympathy
What makes you think I'm not over you?
Oh, I'm bulletproof

Yeah are you boys lined up
Kiss me for a quarter
I'll be a freak show, hero
Shoot me down if you wanna
Cause this fragile little girl's
Got a new suit of armor

Well I could stand in the middle of a thunderstorm
Holding a lightning rod on your roof
This could never shatter me
Don't smother me with sympathy
What makes you think I'm not over you?
Oh, this could never shatter me
Don't smother me with sympathy
What makes you think I'm not over you?
Oh, I'm bulletproof
(Bulletproof)
I'm bulletproof

I keep having these disturbing dreams
My final days, the end of me
For some odd reason I get one last wish
And every time I wish for this...

Chorus:
Take me fast or take me slow
I don't really care how I go
In the daylight, or in the dark
Just don't let me die of a broken heart

The kinda pain that you just can't take
That sends a strong man to his grave
There's not a pill that can give you rest
Or fill that hole deep in your chest

Chorus

Nooooo
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

I've been crushed by that hurt before
There's no way I could take anymore
If I fell in love and I found it out it would happen again
I'd say take me now

Chorus. (x2)

No, don't let me die of a broken heart
No


You're probably sippin' lemonade and reading Hemingway
Underneath that tree out back in that same house
Where all that love was made
I'm sinkin' down on some corduroy couch
Empty bottles all around, quarter after two
And I'm still tryin' to start my day


Maybe I should call you up right out of the blue
Maybe you'll pick up and maybe I'll get through this time
'Cause all I wanna tell you is you were right
And I miss you and I'm sick of me too


My wandering eye, my little white lies
All the hell I've raised
All the times I made you cry like rain
Tired of lookin' at myself, wishin' I was someone else
Tired of nothin' to lose, tired of nothin' left
I've been thinkin' lately, maybe it's time to change


Maybe I should call you up right out of the blue
Maybe you'll pick up and maybe I'll get through this time
'Cause all I wanna tell you is you were right
I miss you and I'm sick of me too


I wanna be your everything, not just a bad memory
I'd rather be your sweet dream come true
I'm sick of me too


Maybe I should call you up right out of the blue
Maybe you'll pick up and maybe I'll get through this time
'Cause all I wanna tell you is you were right

Maybe I should call you up right out of the blue
Maybe you'll pick up and maybe I'll get through this time
'Cause all I wanna tell you is you were right
And I miss you and I'm sick of me too


I'm sick of me too
Yeah I'm sick of me
And I'm sick of me too


All the boats I've missed
All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I got kicked around
I've been black and blue
On my way to you

All the stars I've seen
All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passin' time
Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you


Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile


I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you


Yeah every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile


All the boats I’ve missed
All the hell I’ve caused
All the lips I’ve kissed
All the love I’ve lost
I thank God for that
I guess he always knew
I was on my way to you

On my way to you
On my way to you

She was a woman on a mission
Here to drown him and forget him
So I set her up again to wash him down
She had just about succeeded
When that low-down, no-good cheatin'
Good-for-nothing came strutting through the crowd

Oh, he was laying it on so thick
He never missed a lick
Professing his neverending love
Oh, but I never will forget
When she stood up and said
So I guess you think we're just gonna kiss and make up, don't you
That's when she said

Why don't you kiss, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Me and you, we're through
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this goodbye

Well, the next thing I recall
She had him back against the wall
Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone
She was putting him in his place
And I mean right up in his face
Dragging him down a list of done-me-wrongs

Well, it was just about now
That the crowd gathered 'round
They've come to watch him pay for his every sin
She called him everything under the sun
And when we thought that she was done
She reared back and she let him have it again, man
She said, she said

Why don't you kiss, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Hey, me and you, we're through
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this

Hey, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Me and you, we're through
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this goodbye
Hey, kiss this goodbye (see ya)

Go ahead baby, overreact
Tell me how you feel, don't hold back
It's been way to long since we had a good fight
We both know how we both get
When tempers get heated you know what comes next
So come on baby, lets have it out right now

Chorus:
Slam the door if you want to
Throw the telephone across the rom
Kick everything up against the wall
Let's make ourselves some room
Yeah, let's figt it out baby
'Cause I love makin' up with you

I love the way you look when you're trying to be tough
So let's think of a reason to get us both riled up
Let's cross that line tonight, boy, anything goes

Chorus:
Slam the door if you want to
Throw the telephone across the rom
Kick everything up against the wall
Let's make ourselves some room
Yeah, let's figt it out baby
'Cause I love makin' up with you

Light the candles and pour the champagne
First let's get everything out of the way

Chorus:
Slam the door if you want to
Throw the telephone across the rom
Kick everything up against the wall
Let's make ourselves some room
Yeah, let's figt it out baby
'Cause I love makin' up with you

Yeah turn out the lights baby
You know I love makin' up with you

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I got a buddy that wakes up worrin' about stocks and bonds
He's up and he's down and he only smiles
When the markets strong
I spend my whole week wages
At the dance on Saturday night
I won't never grow a portfolio
But hey that's alright

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I got a cabin in the country and the tin roof rattles
When the rain comes down
Where the wind through the pine helps me unwind
While the world goes 'round

I got a woman that fills my heart so full
That it overflows
And how it gets any better than this
Brother I don't know

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love


They’re the in crowd, we’re the other ones
It’s a different kind of cloth that we’re cut from
We let our colors show, where the numbers ain’t
With the paint where there ain’t supposed to be paint

That’s who we are
That’s how we roll
The Outsiders, The Outsiders


Our women get hot, and our leather gets stained
When we saddle up and ride 'em in the pouring rain
We’re the junkyard dogs, we’re the alley cats
Keep the wind at our front, and the hell at our back


That’s who we are
We do our talking, walk that walk
Wide open rocking
That’s how we roll


Our backs to the wall
A band of brothers
Together, alone, the Outsiders
We’re the riders, we’re the ones burning rubber off our tires
Yeah, we’re the fighters, the all-nighters
So fire them up and get a lil higher

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh


We’re the bad news
We’re the young guns
We’re the ones that they told you to run from
Yeah, the player’s going to play, and a haters going to hate
And a regulators born to regulate
When it hits the fan, and it all goes down
And the gloves come off
You’re going to find out just


That’s who we are
We do our talking, walk that walk
Wide open rocking
That’s how we roll


Our backs to the wall
A band of brothers
Together, alone, the Outsiders
We’re the riders, we’re the ones burning rubber off our tires
Yeah, we’re the fighters, the all-nighters
So fire them up and get a lil higher

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
You’re going to know who we are


Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

That’s who we are

(Danny Wells/Anthony Smith/Ron Harbin)

Billy Joe had a bumper sticker on the back of his beatup Chevrolet
Said this truck eats fords for lunch so I pulled up beside him my new mustang
I was just getting ready to say boy that trucks seen it's last meal
But I was wanting to climb in that Chevy when I saw what was sitting behind that wheel

Chorus:
Mornin' sun found a new mustang
Abandoned in a Walmart parking lot
Note on the seat said "Don't tow me away"
Didn't stop the gossip tongues from waggin'
'Til next day somewhere around 3 o'clock
No tellin' what they're talkin about
What's going 'round
It's too late to worry about that now

Where do men so big and bad learn all them words so sweet and soft
It made my world spin 'round so fast I thought it was gonna sling me off
Red mud on the finders might have gave a clue as to where we'd been
And no one knows just what went on except the moon, me and him

Repeat chorus

Now that we come showin' up
Rumors bouncin' off of that truck
Just a let 'em stare at him and me
'Cause I don't care about anything but us

Repeat chorus


Give me skies of black and blue, the way you make me feel
Give me skies of green and red, cold winds that make it real
Storms are brewing deep within of hurt and loss and pride
It's good to see the world in pain when I take a walk outside


When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try
When it rains, Some people get down, They're sporting a frown, so I fit right in
Yeah, the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way, I'd take the rain


I don't care about politics or the hypocrites on my TV
I'm not mad at the girl who left because she couldn't be with me
So make up your theories about the scandals and the lies
Start out depressed then everything comes as a pleasant surprise



It's not your fault, I know you try
And I'm not the only thing in your life
But these long nights
Get to me like a bad dream
And I die

A Woman gets lonely, baby
If you could only love me
The way you used to do
If you would hold me darlin'
Tell me you want me
More than anything
Cause I need you
I need you to be my man
A woman gets lonely

I miss your touch, the man I knew
Those secret ways you turn me loose
I'm not strong now
And I can't go on living this way
Without love

A Woman gets lonely, baby
If you could only love me
The way you used to do
If you would hold me darlin'
Tell me you want me
More than anything
Cause I need you
I need you to be my man
A woman gets lonely

A Woman gets lonely
Maybe tonight it will be right
Maybe tonight you will be mine
Come on, hold me
Hold me like you know me

A Woman gets lonely, baby
If you could only love me
The way you used to do
If you would hold me darlin'
Tell me you want me
More than anything
Cause I need you
I need you to be my man
A woman gets lonely


I'm pushing you away each time I pull up that ol' barstool
Drownin' you in every drop I drink
Telling you to go to hell but I'm talking to myself
'Cause you're not around to hear what I think
I'm trying to teach my heart to hate you but it ain't workin' right
Now the truth is I'm only
Drinkin' me lonely tonight


And Lord, it's more than just thirsty that I'm feeling inside
'Cause these tears I've been crying have left me bone dry
I wish the bartender had a cure I could buy
But the truth is I'm only
Drinkin' me lonely tonight


He said I'd have to choose between your love and this old bar room
I just laughed but I guess you knew best
Who cares who's right or wrong tonight, my better half is gone
And this whiskey's laying claim to all that's left
So I'll just order up another and pretend I'm all right
When the truth is I'm only
Drinkin' me lonely tonight


And Lord, it's more than just thirsty that I'm feeling inside
'Cause these tears I've been crying have left me bone dry
I wish the bartender had a cure I could buy
But the truth is I'm only
Drinkin' me lonely tonight


So I'll just order up another and pretend I'm all right
When the truth is I'm only
Drinkin' me lonely tonight

I was ten, I was thin, I was playing first base
With a secondhand glove and dirt on my face
In nowhere, Virginia
Who'd ever figure that kid in the yard would go very far

It was 419 Lakewood, had no silver spoons
Just an old beat-up upright that played out of tune
Now I'm singing and living the life that I love
And when I count my blessings, I thank God I was an American child

An American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child

Seven pounds, three ounces, she's got my nose
And she's into my heart as deep as it goes
With a promise that's more than just someone's last name
Anyone's equal, in late August came an American child

An American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child

My grandfather would have been eighty today
But in '45 he fell down beside an American child

An American child
Oh, an American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child
Oh, an American child


She said what she wants is a man to be faithful
A true heart somebody willing and able
To stay by her side through thick and thin
A tender touch every now and then
She's not hung up on fairy tales
Or some dream at the bottom of a wishing well
Fancy cars or diamond rings
What she wants most are the little things


That's what she gets
That's what she gets
That's what she gets for loving me


At times I lay awake at night
Stare at her laying by my side
Knowing there in her heart as she sleeps
She can forever count on me




Whatever turns her on
I'm here to do it
Till the day they write my name in stone
I'll live to prove it



I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well, I'm getting older, too

So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
Landslide will bring you down


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white




I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white


May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

She's in the kitchen at the crack of dawn
Bacon's on, coffee's strong
Kids running wild, taking off their clothes
If she's a nervous wreck, well it never shows
Takes one to football and one to dance
Hits the Y for aerobics class
Drops by the bank, stops at the store
Has on a smile when I walk through the door
The last to go to bed, she'll be the first one up
And I thought I was tough

She's strong, pushes on, can't slow her down
She can take anything life dishes out
There was a time
Back before she was mine
When I thought I was tough

We sat there five years ago
The doctors let us know, the test showed
She'd have to fight to live, I broke down and cried

She held me and said it's gonna be alright
She wore that wig to church
Pink ribbon pinned there on her shirt
No room for fear, full of faith
Hands held high singing Amazing Grace
Never once complained, refusing to give up
And I thought I was tough

She's strong, pushes on, can't slow her down
She can take anything life dishes out
There was a time
Back before she was mine
When I thought I was tough

She's a gentle word, the sweetest kiss
A velvet touch against my skin
I've seen her cry, I've seen her break
But in my eyes, she'll always be strong

There was a time
Back before she was mine
When I thought I was tough


Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Always left out, never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood


Now, your buddies get their rocks off on Top 40 radio
But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard
And think Jeff Tweedy is one bad mother
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood


One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightnin' hands
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
They'll be helpless to your musical charms
And they'll all hold up their hands
They'll all wanna dance
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood


First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandanna
She was hotter than the Devil's hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers
Jackson Pollock, and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions
So he turned to his daddy's old .410
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood


Had an axe to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood


So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
They tried to file my points, sand my edges
And I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, I'm Mr. Misunderstood


They're standing in line, chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was
And hell if they know what they're trying to find
If it ain't that same old, been-done kind
Yeah, gives the head-scratchers fits
Wondering how in the hell they missed
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood


Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
I'm Mr. Misunderstood (let's go out of here)


Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na (I understand)
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na (I understand)
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na (I understand)
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na (I understand...)
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na


When I look in her eyes, it ain't no surprise
Sparks start a flying like the 4th of July
She gets me so hot, my heart starts a popping'
When we get to kissing, there ain't no stopping
When it comes to love, she ain't no slacker
My little darlin' is a firecracker


When I light the fuse, I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick
Son of a gun, she's fun to handle
And she packs a punch like a roman candle
She's a pack of black cats in a red paper wrapper
My little darlin' is a Firecracker


We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
We're a match made in heaven and it ain't no joke
But I'd sure hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing going and it feels so right
She's a firecracker, she's the light of my life


She goes off with a great big bang
Boys, I tell yea it's a beautiful thing
She takes off, you better hang on tight
She's a blonde bottle rocket in the middle of the night
When she makes love she's a heartattacker
My little darlin' is a Firecracker


We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
We're a match made in heaven and it ain't no joke
But I'd sure hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing going and it feels so right
She's a firecracker, she's the light of my life

Yea, we gotta good thing going and it feels so right
She's a Firecracker
She's the light of my life

We gotta good thing going and it feels so right
She's a Firecracker
She's the light of my life





Turn it up some
Alright boys, this is her favorite song
You know that right
So, if we play it good and loud
She might get up and dance again
Ohh, she put her beer down
Here she comes
Here she comes
Left, left, left right left
Whoo


Hustlers shootin' eight ball
Throwin' darts at the wall
Feelin' damn near ten feet tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all
Ol' T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out his chair
Poor ole boy, it ain't his fault
It's so hard not to stare


At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk
(Aww son)


Now Honey, you can't blame her
For what her mama gave her
It ain't right to hate her
For workin' that money-maker
Band shuts down at two
But we're hangin' out till three
We hate to see her go
But love to watch her leave


With that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
With that honky tonk badonkadonk
(Ooh, that's what I'm talkin' bout right there, honey)


We don't care about the drinkin'
Barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start a shakin'
When she gets the urge to dance
Drivin' everybody crazy
You think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look but you can't touch


That honkey tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk


That honky tonk badonkadonk
Yeah, that honky tonk badonkadonk
(That honky tonk badonkadonk)
That's it, right there boys, that's why we do what we do
It ain't for the money, it ain't for the glory, it ain't for the free whiskey
(That honky tonk badonkadonk)
It's for the badonkadonk
(That honky tonk badonkadonk)


People think we're nearing the end of time
But we've had enough and we've drawn the line
Our flag is up since our people went down
And we're together from the country to town
We live back in the woods you see
Big city problems never bothered me
But now the world has changed and so have I
And America can survive, America will survive!
We can plow our fields all day long
We can catch our fish from dusk 'til dawn
Yeah, we have toughed it out a time or two
These are dark days but we're going to pull through
We grow good old tomatoes, we got hometown pride
America can survive, America is going to survive


'Cause you can't scare us out, you can't make us run
What we got here is freedom and fun
We say grace and we say "ma'am"
If they don't like that, we don't give a damn


We came from the West Virginia coal mines
The Rocky Mountains and the big city skylines
Hey, we can hit back and we're going to be fine
'Cause this old country can survive, America can survive
I had a good friend in New York City
Never called Hank, he called me hillbilly
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a street-smart man
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway lights
And I'd send him some of that homemade scuffling wine
He was lost like so many in the terrible strife
And we're all asking God, now why? Oh why?
I read, "A tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye"
And that's an old slogan we're going to revive
'Cause America can survive, America will survive




We're from North California and South Alabama
And all they've done is unite the whole land
There's no more Yankees and Rebels this time
But one united people that stand behind
America can survive, America will survive
America can survive, America is going to survive

Didn't I make ya proud
Go and lay my life down
When you called my name
I thought I stood for somthin'
Was doin' the right thing
When I went away
Now bein' back should be so simple
But I keep gettin' these big signals
From everyone
Why do folks sit and judge me
Who ain't seen what I've seen
Or did what I done?

Didn't I burn
Didn't I bleed
Enough
For you?
I've faced your fears
Felt pain
So you won't have to
Yeah, didn't I do my best
And wasn't home here when I left?

I've seen boys fall to pieces
Grown men cry out for Jesus
Til they're black and blue
I thought God was on our side
Weren't we supposed to be the good guys
That would never lose?
Cuz' I don't see no ticker, tape
Or 5-mile parade sayin'
"Thank you, son."
Just folks that sit and judge me
Who ain't seen what I've seen
Or did what I done

Didn't I burn
Didn't I bleed
Enough
For you?
I've faced your fears
Felt pain
So you won't have to
Yeah, didn't I do my best
And wasn't home here when I left?


Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open


The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open


Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open


So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just got to keep your eyes open


Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes


Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open


Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping


Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open


Life was great, wouldn't change a thing
I had it all, but with you I had more
But out of nowhere, out of the blue
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling


Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober


I'm on the floor, cursing at the door
Broken hearted with a pounding head
And I know, I gotta let you go
So the liquor helps me forget
Your name, your face
This pain I can't erase


Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober


Now you're gone
You moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling...


Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

I stepped out into the blue
Felt the wind hit my face
Before my shoot opened I felt my heart race
I was fallin
Oh that's just fallin

Off the coast of australia
I dove way down deep
For all that I saw of that Great Barrier Reef
It was nothin
Compared to you it was nothin

I got lightning in my vains
Thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sensation half way
Around the world and lookin' back
On what we had
I've done it all I've seen it all but
I can't find a feelin' like that

I wound up in some town in spain
Runnin with the bulls
Tryin to catch another thrill with a thousand other fools
We were runnin
Ah but thats just runnin
When I started pushin 30
It started pushin back

Well how was I to know till now you'd be such a hard act to follow
Nothin seems to follow

I got lightning in my vains
Thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sinsation half way
Around the world and lookin' back
On what we had
I've done it all I've seen it all but
I can't find a feelin' like that

It's like flyin down some back road at midnight
With you eyes closed and the head lights off
Your life is searchin everywhere can't find that feelin anywhere
Your all I want, now all I want is that...

Lightning in my vains
Thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sensation half way
Around the world and looin back
On what we have
I've done it all i've seen it all but I can't find a feelin' like that

Thats right I've done it all
I've seen it all but I can't find a feelin like that


Dragon tales and the "water is wide"
Pirate's sail and lost boys fly
Fish bite moonbeams every night
And I love you


Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh my love will fly to you
Each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams


The rocket racer's all tuckered out
Superman's in pajamas on the couch
Goodnight moon, will find the mouse
And I love you


Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh my love will fly to you
Each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams


God bless mommy and match box cars
God bless dad and thanks for the stars
God hears "Amen," wherever we are
And I love you


Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh my love will fly to you
Each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams

Well, a hammer fell down on a .44 primer
And that was one less problem in South Carolina tonight
Wrong or right

She just looked to me as she finished her tale
The blank expression went another pale shade of gray
There was nothing to say

In the shadows of her face I saw the scars
That you get when you live where love is hard
And she said

"Don't you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat."
"Don't you shrug it off until you've walked a mile in my bare feet."
"There are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play."

Well, I put the cuffs on her and sat her in the car
Walked inside, he was layin' on the floor stone dead
Been shot in the head

There were whiskey bottles and dope by the chair
A starving baby with nothing to wear but tears
So the picture was clear

He had finally pushed her way across the line
And the badge I wore was losing all its shine
And she said

"Don't you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat."
"Don't you shrug it off until you've walked a mile in my bare feet."
"There are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play."

I just stood there thinkin' how justice is blind
But after thirty five years you learn to read the signs
So I made up my mind

I took the cuffs oof her and I walked her back in
Wiped the gun off and wrapped it in his right hand
Where it should've been

And the morning paper read in black and white
It's just another senseless case of suicide
Suicide

Oh, but don't you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat
Don't you shrug it off until you've walked a mile along my beat
There are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play

Well, a hammer fell down on a .44 Primer
And that was one less problem in South Carolina tonight...

Something 'bout the way she’s wearing her dress a little tighter
Something 'bout the way she’s starin', she’s lookin' to start a fire
Something 'bout the way she’s dancin' and drinkin' chill Patron
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long


Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

Something 'bout the way she’s blushin' you can tell she isn’t sure
Let you know she’s up to something she’s never done before
Tonight she wants to hold a stranger but not the one at home
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long


Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

If I had a woman like that
Man I’d let her know
I’d hold her tight
I’d hold her close
Do anything, do everything to let her know
She’d never ever be alone


Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, Lord if she’s lonely now
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long


I'm sure you've heard my reputation it's all over this small town
But there's a little bit of fire under all that smoke
You know how word gets around
Back in the day you were a straight A student
Daddy's little girl, honey what are you doing
Talking about letting your hair down
We'll take a ride on the wild side of town


If you want a bad boy then baby you got it
Got a bad toy sitting in the parking lot
Take you to the wrong side of the tracks
Baby you ain't going to want to come back
Because I'm a free bird and damn proud of it
You're a sweet girl, are you sure you want to ride with me?
Going to raise some hell, going to make some noise
If you want a bad boy
Want a bad boy


Well I'll be out by your driveway when your mom and dad lay down
You can climb on out that window babe
And we'll get on out of town
I'll call up all my rowdy friends
We'll throw down where the dirt road ends
I'll have you back before the rooster crows
Girl, your mom and daddy ain't got to know


If you want a bad boy then baby you got it
Got a bad toy sitting in the parking lot
Take you to the wrong side of the tracks
Baby you ain't going to want to come back
Because I'm a free bird and damn proud of it
You're a sweet girl, are you sure you want to ride with me?
Going to raise some hell, going to make some noise
If you want a bad boy
Want a bad boy


Slide over here


If you want a bad boy then baby you got it
Got a bad toy sitting in the parking lot
Take you to the wrong side of the tracks
Baby you ain't going to want to come back
Because I'm a free bird and damn proud of it
You're a sweet girl, are you sure you want to ride with me?
Going to raise some hell, going to make some noise
If you want a bad boy
Want a bad boy


Girl, you know you want a bad boy


I broke most of Mama’s dishes
She banned me from the kitchen
When I was a kid

I tore Daddy’s truck to pieces
Left it in a heap
That no mechanic could fix

You don’t believe me
I can see you laughing
But trust me
I’m an accident waiting here to happen


'Cause I break things
Anything I touch
I just get around and
Then I’m bound to tear ‘em up

Yeah, I make things
Snap and fall apart
So if you wanna hold me, boy
You’d better watch your heart
'Cause I break things


You say I’m nothing you can’t handle
You’re tougher than enamel
Well, baby
We’ll see

I’m like a wrecking ball coming
You’re better off running
Far away from me

Don’t get me wrong now
Baby, I adore ya
It’s only right that
I give you fair warning




Rain is wet
The desert is dry
That’s the way it’ll always be

Fire is hot
It’s dark at night
The sun comes up in the east



I break things


When I was nineteen, I threw my stuff in the car
Headed up to the Rockies, took a job at this bar
Selling beer to the locals and just barely getting by
On the tips from the rich kids, they're on daddy's dime
But from the moment she walked in one night
I knew I'd be all right


In Telluride, snow falling down
I was waking up in that sleepy little town
In her eyes, my world came so alive
I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride


We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire
Casting shadows on the cabin wall, drowning in desire
Confessin' all our secrets and laughin' out loud
So high up on that mountain, I thought we'd never come down
It was a dream we were living in
And I was the happiest I'd ever been


In Telluride, snow falling down
Waking up with her in that sleepy little town
In her eyes, my world came was alive
I never will forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride
Oh, oh, yeah


It ended just like a movie scene
And I had to play the part
Of the lover who stood there
And watched her leave
Me with the frozen heart


In Telluride, snow falling down
Standing there alone in that sleepy little town
In her eyes, my world came so alive
I never will forget the day she said goodbye


Telluride, snow falling down
I was waking up in that sleepy little town
In her eyes, my world came so alive
I never will forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride
Oh, in Telluride

Tell me, how'd we ever get this far
And lose each other
We say we're gonna stay good friends
But I know better

You leave so little room for doubt
You seem to have this all worked out
But there is one thing before you leave

How, how am I supposed to live without you
Now, how do I go on breathing
When the dream that I've been living's left me now
Tell me how

It feels to be so sure
Its really over
How we gonna tell our friends
We're not together

When people ask where you are
They break another piece of my heart
Can you tell me what I'm supposed to say

How, how am I supposed to live without you
Now, how do I go on breathing
When the dream that I've been living's left me now
Tell me how

Before you turn and walk away
And turn your back on yesterday
And turn us into just a memory

How, how am I supposed to live without you
Now, how, do I go on breathing
How, how, am I supposed to live without you
Now, how, do I go on breathing
When the dream that I've been living's left me now
Tell me how


Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands


He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means to love someone


We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom


He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means to love someone




He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means to love someone


He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means to love someone

Love someone, no

Driving through town just my boy and me
With a happy meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldn't have the toy
Till his nuggets were gone
A green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
His fries went a flying and his orange drink covered his lap
Well then my four year old said a four letter word
That started with "s" and I was concerned
So I said son now now where did you learn to talk like that



He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you

We got back home and I went to the barn
I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said Lord please help me help my stupid self
Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turning on my son's Scooby Doo nightlight
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands
And spoke to God like he was talking to a friend
And I said son now where'd you learn to pray like that



He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We like fixing things and holding mama's hand
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you



With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said my little bear is growing up
He said but when I'm big I'll still know what to do



Cause I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
By then I'll be as strong as superman
We'll be just alike, hey won't we dad
When I can do everything you do
Cause I've been watching you


Yeah, you got every guy in here
Spinning around spilling their beer
Bet you came out to have a good time
What you say you leave your friends with mine?
Oooh, ooh, yeah, they'll be alright
Ooh, I just wanna see you shine


Girl you're tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl
Yeah, let me see you girl


Whatcha think about taking that chance
Taking a ride, taking my hand
Kicking this crowd, ditching this club?
This night's been waiting on us
Ooh, ooh, save your best moves, ooh, ooh
Yeah, 'til I get us where we're getting to


Girl you're tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl


I can see you getting my tailgate rocking
Moving your hips like wind moves cotton
You can get the whole wide country side hopping


Bring the beat back
Aw, come on with me girl


Yeah, you're tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl
Yeah, let me see you girl
Come on come on come on, let me see you girl

Parody of "How Do You Like Me Now" by Toby Keith (Toby Keith/Chuck Cannon) Tokeco Tunes/Wacissa River Music (admin. by MRBI) (BMI)

Yeah I was always the lazy one
A Southern Californian
But I've got some kinfolk on the Mason-Dixon line
So this summer just for fun
Hopped in my DeLorean
And headed for my uncle's farm for a short time

I thought that I would be huntin' and fishin'
I misunderstood him somehow
So far there's nothin' but chores here to mention
I didn't mind feedin the sows

But HOW DO YOU MILK A COW?
How do you milk a cow?
I wasn't in FFA
This cow must think i'm crazy
Up under it this way
I'm sittin' here a pullin', but there ain't nothin' comin' out
Oh E I E I Oâ€¦
How do you milk a cow?

Yeah I love it here in Tennesse
But these farmers all make fun of me
Can't haul much hay in a tiny sports car
So I got myself a 4 wheel drive
Learned to spotlight deer at night
And I've got shearin' sheep right down to an art

One thing's for sure
I hate shovelin' manure
It gets all over my overalls
Them horses need shoein'
I hear Bessie mooin'
So I thought maybe I'd ask you all

HOW DO YOU MILK A COW?
How do you milk a cow?
I think it's safe to say
A man could get arrested for this in LA
This heifer must be empty 'cause she ain't puttin out
Oh E I E I O
Tell me how do you milk a cow

(Spoken)
This song is absolutely an "udder" disaster
I hope I don't get mad cow diease

How do you milk a cow?
I no longer care
I'm gettin sick and tired of smellin' dairy air
I'm headin' back to Cali
And I'm turnin' in my plow
Oh E I E I O
How do you milk a cow?


You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel
Left all alone


Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this
Long & winding road


I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home


You know that I've seen
So many romantic dreams
Up in lights, falling off
The silver screen


My hearts like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing
Keeps me together
At the seams


I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home


Um, I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Yeah... I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home


I might not have a million dollars in the bank
But I've got food on my table
And gas in my tank

I might not have designer sheets
On a king size bed
But I lay down at night with a roof over my head

Yeah, I've got friends who love me
A big blue sky above me
And your two arms around me, baby
Every night


Isn't that everything?
I don't need anything
It's only the simple things I believe
That matter most in life

I'm more than satisfied
All that I have is all I need
Isn't that everything?


Now I'm not saying I don't dream
From time to time
Every girl I know
Loves the way a diamond shines

But when the party's over
And the glitter starts to fade
It's all about your piece of mind
At the end of every day

I know Jesus loves me
Up in that sky above me
I see that morning sun again
And feel alive




Yeah, I've got friends who love me
A big blue sky above me
And your two arms around me, baby
Every night

I know Jesus loves me
Up in that sky above me
I see that morning sun again
And feel alive



Isn't that everything?
Isn't that everything?

She shaves his face
She combs his hair
She helps him find his rocking chair
She cooks his meals
She wipes his mouth
And the window that he's looking out
She reads him books
She speaks his name
Oh every day is much the same
She sighs that sigh from deep within
The one that says
She misses him

She misses his gentle touch
And the way he used to make her laugh
She misses the man he was
In all of those old photographs
So strong, so kind, so sweet, so smart
The man who stole her very heart
She misses him

His children come on Saturday
They're at his feet
His grandkids play
It's sad they don't know him at all
He's just the one they call grandpa
They take out his trash
They mow his lawn
Things he can't do since he's been gone
She's grateful that they're pitching in
And like everyone
She misses him

She misses his gentle touch
And the way he used to make her laugh
She misses the man he was
In all of those old photographs
So strong, so kind, so sweet, so smart
The man who stole her very heart
She misses him

And yes they're still together
After all these years
But sometimes you can almost feel
The sadness in her tears

She misses his gentle touch
And the way he used to make her laugh
She misses the man he was
In all of those old photographs
So strong, so kind, so sweet, so smart
The man who stole her very heart
She misses him

Billy's standing out by a west Texas highway
With his thumb in the morning air
He's spent 18 summers in the dust of Odessa
Never getting nowhere
But he's got him a misspelled cardboard of
Albuquerque
Standin' in the breakdown lane
He ain't lookin' for a ride so much as he's looking for a

Change, a little something different for cryin' out loud
Change
Even for the worse, it would be better somehow
Sometimes you just cross that line
Where everything is more of the same
When it's do or die, step aside, turn the tide
Something's gotta change

Betty's walkin' out of a tattoo parlor
She's got curlers in her hair
She still can't believe she had a little red rose
Put right on her derriere
And she's still gotta pick up that red lace teddy
And a bottle of pink champagne
Well her husband doesn't know it
But tonight well
He's in for a

Change, a little something different for cryin' out loud
Yeah a change
Even for the worse would be better somehow
Sometimes you just cross that line
Where everything is more of the same
When it's do or die, step aside, turn the tide
Somethin's gotta change

Now who of us hasn't been heading home on Friday
Sitting at some traffic light
Wondering what would happen if we just took a left
Instead of takin' that faithful ole right
It's the human condition, part of us wishes
That life wouldn't get so tame
And we all know better than to think that's ever gonna

Change, a little something different for cryin' out loud
Yeah a change
Even for the worse would be better somehow
Looking for a change
Change
Yeah a change
Looking for a change, yeah

I drink my Coke, I read the paper
I sit and listen to the 6 o'clock news
It's like the whole world has gone to pieces
And we're all part of the wrecking crew
Ain't nothing so broke we can't fix it
It just needs a little TLC
Yeah in a dry spell what can you do but
Be the rain everybody needs
Bring on the love, I know you got in in ya
Bring on the love and take it through the night
Drive it from California to Virginia
Ain't nothing else that's gonna make it right
So bring on the love, bring on the love
Ain't no big mystery, ain't rocket science
Don't take a genius to figure it out
A little mercy, a little kindness
Yeah baby, ain't that what it's all about?
Bring on the love, I know you got in in ya
Bring on the love and take it through the night
Drive it from California to Virginia
Ain't nothing else that's gonna make it right
So bring on the love, bring on the love
Ooh yeah
Alright
Ooh yeah
Bring on the love, I know you got in in ya
Bring on the love and take it through the night
Drive it from California to Virginia
Ain't nothing else gonna make it right
So bring on the love, bring on the love
Drive it from California to Virginia
Ain't nothing else that's gonna make it right
So bring on the love, bring on the love
Alright


I cCome home late at night
With my boots in my hand
Stumble in the back door
Being quite as i can
And i know she's there in bed
Cold and all alone
And she's crying
Because i'm breaking up our home


And She Knows
The hell I'm going through
In this world
Inside my head
There's a devil
In the bottle
And he want's
To see me dead


I Fall into her arms
And she helps me with my clothes
I Guess she stays On with me
Because she really knows
That I'm trying Lord
To find my freedom
By escaping to the only
Freedom i've ever known




Yes there's a devil
Living in the bottle
And he Want's
To see me dead
And it's killing her too
Watching me die this Way


There's no need to hide anything
Baby just know what you bring
Will always be enough
All of those things that you do
Are the reasons that I fell for you
And why, I believe in us


Baby shoot straight from your heart
You'll never miss your mark
Baby always shoot straight from your heart
Let truth be the path that you choose
There ain't no way we can lose
Baby always shoot straight from your heart


We're gonna make some mistakes
'Cause baby I sure ain't no saint
I swear I'm in for the long haul
It doesn't matter how far
I love you just how you are
I will answer when you call



It's gonna go a little something like this
I'm gonna lean in to give you a kiss
You're gonna get a little tingle in your lips
And I bet you'll want another
I've been waiting for a pretty long time
Been standing in a pretty long line
Now I'm staring in your pretty little eyes
Girl, don't you make me suffer
I'm about to show you some love
Girl, I think you best buckle up
Look at our small town spinning around
We've got our feet dangling high off the ground
Can you believe, baby, how good it feels
Falling in love, falling in love on a Ferris wheel
Falling in love
I can see the top of your house
Bet your daddy's getting worried 'bout now
Probably got that telescope out
And he hates my arms around you
Operator says, I'm sorry, we're stuck
I say girl, how lucky for us
Look at our small town spinning around
We've got our feet dangling high off the ground
Can you believe, baby, how good it feels
Falling in love, falling in love on a Ferris wheel
Look what we've found
A hundred feet off the ground
Don't you look down, look at me
And our small town spinning around
We've got our feet dangling high off the ground
Can you believe, baby, how good it feels
Falling in love, falling in love
Look at our small town spinning around
We've got our feet dangling high off the ground
Can you believe, baby, how good it feels
Falling in love, falling in love on a Ferris wheel
Falling in love, on a Ferris wheel
Falling in love
We go 'round, we go 'round, we go 'round
We go 'round, we go 'round, we go 'round
We go 'round, we go 'round
On a Ferris wheel, falling in love

What if that road that you're taking's a dead end?
What if love leaves you all jaded and broken?
What if that limb breaks you're climbing out on?
Yeah, what if it all goes wrong?

But, what if it all goes right?
What if it all works out?
What if the stars line up and good luck rains down?
What if you chase your dreams and it changes your whole life?
Yeah, what if it all goes right?

What if that road is a beautiful slow drive?
What if that love ends up lasting a lifetime?
What if that limb holds you oak tree strong?
What if this time nothing goes wrong?

But, what if it all goes right?
What if it all works out?
What if the stars line up and good luck rains down?
What if you chase your dreams and it changes your whole life?
Yeah, what if it all goes right?

What if you climb to the mountain top and touch the sky?
Grab a cloud as it passes by?
You might fall you might fall
But then again you might fly

What if it all goes right?
What if it all works out?
What if the stars line up and good luck rains down?
What if you chase your dreams and it changes your whole life?
Yeah, what if it all goes right?


Tick tock, I'm on the clock and I'm feeling like
This job's just 9 to 5'ing my life away
It's like I'm back in school and I'm in the last class
And I'm passing time until the bell ring
Having visions of summertime
Wait a minute now, that's just later tonight
Tan legs and tailgating, it's all up in the moonlight
And by the way, it's pay day


Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies, let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
We live it up for the weekend


Backwoods looking like Panama City
A bunch of jacked up trucks and bikinis
Got a Yeti full of good ideas
Like I ain't worried 'bout driving, I'mma stay right here


And I'mma live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies, let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we're at it again
We live it up for the weekend


Somebody said something 'bout church on Sunday, amen
Somebody said something 'bout work on Monday
Shh, don't say it again


Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies, let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we're at it again
We live it up for the weekend


Live it up, live it up for the weekend
Live it up for the weekend
Live it up, live it up for the weekend
Live it up, live it up
It's the weekend


From a phone booth in Cheyenne
I made a promise to Diane
No more rodeos
I'd gone my last go 'round
The same promise that I made
In San Antone and Santa Fe
But tonight I saddled up
And let her down


Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild, and her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away


She watched me drive around her block
Gettin' courage up to stop
To make her one more promise
That I can't keep
The way I love the rodeo
I guess I should let her go
Before I hurt her more
Than she loves me


Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild, and her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away


Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild, and her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away


Taking down your neighbor won't take you any higher
I burned my own damn finger poking someone else's fire
I've never gotten taller making someone else feel small
If you ain't got nothing nice to say, don't say nothing at all


Just ho​e your own row, yeah, and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy


Nobody's perfect, we've all lost and we've all lied
Most of us have cheated, the rest of us have tried
The holiest of holies even slip from time to time
We've all got dirty laundry hanging on the line


Just ho​e your own row, yeah, and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy


Pouring salt in my sugar won't make yours any sweeter
Pissing in my yard ain't gonna make yours any greener
And I wouldn't know about the rocks in your shoes
So I'll just do me and, honey, you can just do you


Just ho​e your own row, yeah, and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy


You're doin' all you can, to get in them old jeans
You want that body back, you had at seventeen
Well, baby, don't get down, don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause the way you fill 'em out, hey, that's alright with me


I don't want the girl you used to be
An' if you ain't noticed, the kids are fast asleep, and you're...


One hot mama
You turn me on, let's turn it up, and turn this room into a sauna
One hot mama
Oh, what do you say, babe? You wanna?


Well, I know sometimes you think, that all you really are
Is the woman with the kids, and the groceries in the car
And you worry about your hips, and you worry about your age
Meanwhile I'm tryin' to catch, the breath you take away


Oh, an' believe me, you still do
Baby, all I see, when I look at you, is...


One hot mama
You turn me on, let's turn it up, and turn this room into a sauna
One hot mama
Oh, what do you say, babe? You wanna?


I can't imagine me lovin' someone else
I'm a lucky man, I think Daddy's got himself


One hot mama
You turn me on, let's turn it up, and turn this room into a sauna
One hot mama
Oh, what do you say, babe?
Oh, now what do you say, babe? You wanna?


You're one hot mama
Let's turn this room into a sauna, yeah
What do you say, babe?
What do you say, babe?

I burn that dirt, hug that road
Plug my lip with a fist full of Skoal
12 gauge cock, shift down low
Bounce mud tires like a bass on a pole

Up ahead, something ain't right
It ain't a deer in my KC lights
Oh sweet jesus, a city boy prius
Flingin' up mud, so I start a singin'

Hey (Hey) city boy stuck
He's worthless as a one point buck
Never heard of a four-wheel-drive
Now he's spinnin' spinnin'
Spinnin' spinnin' spinnin'
Them tires. Hey (Hey) city boy
Stuck penny-loafers didn't bring
No luck, should I throw him a rope?
Nope Hell no! Not me!
I'm rollin' on rollin' on by YEE-YEE!!!

Back and forth, the mud got thicker
Kick good dirt on his Democrat sticker
Run his mouth, getting all pissed
When you shoulda' bought a car
That you don't bug in. I got a shotgun
Ridin' shotgun no room to give him a lift
I pull over, crack a cold one on his
Shoulder and put in another dip, and yell

Hey (Hey) city boy stuck, he's worthless
As a one point buck, never heard
Of a four-wheel drive, now he's spinnin'
Spinnin' spinnin'
Spinnin' spinnin' them tires
Hey (Hey) city boy stuck penny-loafers
Didn't bring no luck, should I throw him
A rope? Nope Hell no! Not me!
I'm rollin' on rollin' on by YEE-YEE!!!


Hey City boy, I'm Earl Dibbles Jr
I'm a country boy
You're a long way from town
To be runnin' your mouth. You see them
Tires spinnin' like that, us country boys
Use nothin' but mud tires 4X4
You got your hair slicked back in
Your skinny jeans, collar popped
Up and your car's itty bitty
Better turn around and go
Back to the city YEE-YEE!!!


You can pop that clutch you can
Pop that collar, I'm a pop this top
While I holler. You can pop that
Clutch you can pop that collar
I'ma pop this top, while I holler

Hey (Hey) city boy stuck, he's
Worthless as a one point buck
Never heard of a four-wheel-drive
Now he's spinnin' spinnin' spinnin'
Spinnin' spinnin' them tires

Hey (Hey) city boy stuck
Penny-loafers didn't bring no
Luck, should I throw him a rope?
Nope Hell no! Not me! I'm rollin'
On rollin' on by YEE-YEE!!!


He don't put a good dip in
Don't crack a cold one, don't fix
Dhe tree, don't rope stuff
Don't shoot the gun
Barbed wire tattoo
Don't even go all the way around
YEE-YEE!!!


She keeps it all together
I always come unwound
She's cool calm and collected
I wanna paint the town
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a dancehall Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a lonestar neon light
She has another side
That no one sees but me
She is the only one
That brings me to my knees
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away


When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look


She sparkles like a diamond
She twinkles like a star
She's like a ray of sunshine
That always melts my heart
And when I'm feeling empty
Her love makes me whole
Just like a country breeze
That soothes my weary soul




Slow dancin'
Romancin'
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but her beautiful smile
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but a beautiful smile
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a neon light


There's a rumor goin' 'round
That it looks like splitsville between us
But all of that talk's just talk
So don't you believe it
'Cause I got a call from my baby
And she was all "guess what?"


We're makin' up
Our on again off again is on again
We're makin' up
She really wants to make it work
I'm still so in love with her
Forget about everything you heard
We're makin' up


Well, I'm the first to admit
That the road's been a little bit bumpy
But don't you think for a moment
That she don't love me
Take your nosey little nose and get a whiff
Of these roses on the seat of my truck


We're makin' up
Our on again off again is on again
We're makin' up
She really wants to make it work
I'm still so in love with her
Forget about everything you heard


Yeah, we argue a little to much
Maybe we broke up more than once
Ah, but this is the part I love


We're makin' up
Our on again off again is on again
We're makin' up
She really wants to make it work
I'm still so in love with her
Forget about everything you heard


We're makin' up
Our on again off again is on again
We're makin' up
She really wants to make it work
I'm still so in love with her
Forget about everything you heard
We're makin' up


We're makin' up
Our on again off again is on again
We're makin' up
We're makin' up


Happy people don't cheat
Happy people don't lie
They don't judge, or hold a grudge, don't criticize
Happy people don't hate
Happy people don't steal
Cause all the hurt sure ain't worth all the guilt they feel


If you wanna know the secret
Can't buy it, gotta make it
You ain't ever gonna be it
By takin' someone else's away
Never take it for granted
You don't have to understand it
Here's to whatever what puts a smile on your face
Whatever makes you happy, people


Happy people don't fail
Happy people just learn
Don't think they're above the push and shove
Just wait their turn
They always got a hand, or a dollar to spare
Know the golden rule or what you're goin' through
Even if they never been there


If you wanna know the secret
Can't buy it, gotta make it
You ain't ever gonna be it
By takin' someone else's away
Never take it for granted
You don't have to understand it
Here's to whatever what puts a smile on your face
Whatever makes you happy, people




These days ain't always easy to find
They're the ones that you want standing by your side
No time for greed, if they need some, give 'em a slice
And we'll all be happy people


Well, life is short
And love is rare
And we all deserve to be happy while we're here


The body's a temple, that's what we're told
I've treated this one like an old honky-tonk
Greasy cheeseburgers and cheap cigarettes
One day they'll get me if they ain't got me yet


'Cause I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow


My friends all grew up, they settled down
Built nice little houses on the outskirts of town
They work in their office, drive SUVs
They pray for their babies and they worry 'bout me


'Cause I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow


I'm always running
Son of a gunning
I've had a good time it's true
But the way I've been going
It's time that I toned it
Down just a notch or two
Oh yeah


Well I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow
Well I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow


Yeah I need to rewind real slow
Yeah I still got some miles to go


Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone


Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere


I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in


Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot señioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere


I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You’re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb


Some beach, somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up that atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere
On some beach, somewhere


That water tower's got the sun going down behind it
If there’s a good time in this town, girl, we're gonna find it
You looked so damn good climbing up in my Chevy
Tried to play it cool but I knew already
By the way you looked in the dashboard lights
It was gonna be one of those nights


Got the kenwoods banging that rock n' roll
Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go
I can ride you round town or drive you down some old back road
I love the way you lean that seat back, steal my ball-cap
Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watching your hair fly out the window
Just letting the night roll
And I can't wait to see where it goes


We can run the reds down Main Street dodging the blue lights
Or disappear off into the corn out past the county line
Baby keep on keep on swaying to the back-beat
Long as you're right here right here beside me
You make the call baby, I don't care
We can take this anywhere



Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go
I can ride you round town or drive you down some old back road

Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watching your hair fly out the window
Just letting the night roll
And I can't wait to see where it goes



Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go
I can ride you round town or drive you down some old back road

Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watching your hair fly out the window
Just letting the night roll
And I can't wait to see where it goes



And I can't wait to see where it goes
I can't wait to see where it goes, oh yeah
Just letting the night roll

Lately I've been lonely
Lord knows I don't like that feeling
Anymore than you like feeling lonely too
I don't know which one's to blame
For almost putting out our flame
But for me it's not the thing for us to do

The way it was, the way we were
Baby, you and me is where it was at
And I want, I want us back

Girl, we've come too far
For us to give up on tomorrow
Where we've shared so many good time yesterdays
If I know you like I think I do
I know that you don't want to lose
The me and you, I'm dying to save

The way it was, the way we were
Baby, you and me is where it was at
And I want, I want us back

I want to feel your love all over me
Wrapped up in us is where I want to be
I want, I want
I want to feel your love all over me
Wrapped up in us is where I want to be
I want, I want us back

Lately I've been lonely
Lord knows I don't like that feeling
Anymore than you like feeling lonely too


Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight


Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh


A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank and there we got upset




In a one-horse open sleigh


Whooo umm yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today


Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long


Through all these cities and all these towns
It is in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors


Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Give me give me give me give me yeah


Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye

Ooh, yeah

There ain't no load that I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors


Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Give me give me give me give me yeah

In my next life, I won't cuss so much
I won't ever touch that first cigarette
In my next life, I'll stay away from bad boys
I'll listen to that voice inside of my head

I won't wake up and look in the mirror
Wondering what I did last night

But in this life, I wanna have a good time
I wanna live fast, hit it as hard as anybody has
Till they turn out the lights
If I get to come back, I promise you that
I'm gonna walk a straighter line

In my next life, I'll keep my shirt on
When I'm at Mardi Gras, getting loose and free
In my next life, I won't do body shots
I won't think I've got to try everything

I'm gonna be a little angel
Who gets her kicks flying right

But in this life, I wanna have a good time
I wanna live fast, hit it as hard as anybody has
Till they turn out the lights
If I get to come back, I promise you that
I'm gonna walk a straighter line
In my next life

In this life, I wanna have a good time
I wanna live fast, hit it as hard as anybody has
Till they turn out the lights
If I get to come back, I promise you that
I'm gonna walk a straighter line
In my next life, mmm

I'll keep my shirt on when I'm at Mardi Gras, mmm

If it ain’t broke, you can bet that I’m gonna break it
If there’s a wrong road, I’m damn sure gonna take it
Where there’s smoke, my pocket lighter sparked the fire
Where there’s blue lights, just read me my rights

No, they don’t make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ain’t gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim, hell, I’m to blame

Where there’s a love, I tell ya, girl, I love to hate it
Where there’s a do not touch, my finger print done stained it
Where there’s a train wreck, sit on back and watch me crash
Where there’s a what, you say, damn right I said it

No, they don’t make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ain’t gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim, hell, I’m to blame

For breaking your heart, taking this living a little too hard
Drinking too much and playing too loud, where there’s a scar I carved it out

No, they don’t make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ain’t gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim, hell, I’m to blame

I know where to aim, hell, I’m to blame


Ooh yeah


I love the way you wear those worn-out blue jeans
Walking all around in the big sunshine
Baby, let me believe that you're perfect
At least for a little while


And you don't have to tell me what you're thinking
You can keep all that to yourself
Baby, we got such a good thing going
Don't show me that you're someone else


'Cause I'm acting as if this blue sky's
Never gonna rain down on me
I'm telling myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely
Unless there's something I've missed
I'm acting as if
(As if, as if, as if)
(As if, as if, as if)


We don't have to have that conversation
Baby don't you think it's going fine
We don't need to send out invitations
To tell the world that you're mine


'Cause I'm acting as if this blue sky's
Never gonna rain down on me
I'm telling myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely
Unless there's something I've missed
I'm acting as if


As if your sweet kiss is never gonna fade away
And the way you look at me will never change
'Cause I love the way you wear those worn-out blue jeans
Walking all around in the big sunshine


'Cause I'm acting as if this blue sky's
Never gonna rain down on me
And I'm telling myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely
I'm acting as if this blue sky's
Never gonna rain down on me
I'm telling myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely


Unless there's something I've missed
Unless there's something I've missed
I'm acting as if
(As if, as if, as if) oooh yeah
(As if, as if, as if)
Oh I'm acting as if
(As if, as if, as if)
(As if, as if, as if)


Pour a drink and take a sip of it
Feelin' like a hypocrite
Couple more and I don't give a shit
I never used to talk, I never used to talk like this


I’m sorry I named the album ‘Montevallo’
And I’m sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
I’m sorry you can’t listen to the radio
And drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham
I know you want your privacy
And you’ve got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans
With these songs you gave to me
'Member the first time you stayed with me?
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMAs with me
Two years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk, barely holdin' on, on ABC
Hope your dad still prays for me


Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around


A year ago, I was in a hotel room in Phoenix
Wonderin' if it's ever okay to lie
'Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
But I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life
But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye
Every night, you'd fill the bathtub up
Lie there for hours, put your face under water and cry
I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
Turn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers
I know you think my dreams came true
Since you been gone, singin' these songs are just something to do
The only dream I ever had was you
I hope you know I'm still in love, it's the kind you can't fall out of


Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around


I know this might seem like a contradiction
And the last thing you need is more unwanted attention
But you changed your number, and moved
And this is the only way I could reach you
So wherever you are, turn it up and listen


Hannah Lee, I'm on my way to you
Nobody can love you like I do
I don't know what I'm gon' say to you
But I know there ain't no way, know there ain't no way
Know there ain't no way we're through

Quarter moon
Always makes me think of you
Are you thinking of me too
When you see it shine?

It’s kind of sad
But i'm smiling
Imagine that
'Cause we were lucky to have what we had
If only for a time

Didn't we set the nights on fire
Did ever a flame burn any higher
Wasn't it so sweet
Wasn't it
Didn't we love?

It's ok
Sometimes I just get this way
I can’t forget you anyway
I wouldn’t even try

I'd rather fall
Than never to have flown at all
It was heaven after all
If only for a time

Didn’t we set the nights on fire
Did ever a flame burn any higher
Wasn't it so sweet
Wasn't it
Didn't we love?

Oh didn’t we have it all back then
Will I feel that way again?

Didn’t we set the nights on fire
Did ever a flame burn any higher
Wasn’t it so sweet
Wasn’t it
Didn’t we love?

Isn't it bitter sweet
Isn't it
Didn't we love?


Talk about an uphill battle
2000 acres of beans and cattle
But he don't ever get a rattle
He just goes 'til the sun goes down
Hydraulic fluid on his jeans
Red dye diesel and ten rows between
A cold one on the porch and a good night's sleep
Y'all hold 'em up with me now


Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife that loves him every night
Raising a son or raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer


Subdivisions creeping on in
Neighborhood kids keep jumping his fence
He could double his money
But that'd be the end of a promise he'll never break
Cause he looked his daddy in the eye
And he's got that stubborn pride
He'll be here 'til the day he dies
No, he wouldn't have it any other way


Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife that loves him every night
Raising a son or raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer




Here's to the farmer that loves his day in the sun
Won't sell that ol' half-ton
Nobody knows better 'bout a hard-earned dollar
Just tell him how far he's gotta go and he'll go farther
Here's to the farmer
Here's to the farmer
Thank you, boys

It was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running
Daddy’s old Winnebago

Wing and a prayer down 65
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it

To Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Like a storm, time rolls on
You can’t hit pause, that's just the deal
Most days in life don’t stand out
But life’s about those days that we all like

Rocking Randall
Getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
‘til the Alabama sun was breaking

Over Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

When the winds go cold
And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind

Tonight I’m in Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Talladega
Talladega


It's just another simple
Voicemail message
I'll pick you up and we'll do
Dinner by the fire
And we'll just watch it snow
It's from a year ago
Baby, I love you
And I can't wait to see you tonight
I've been thinking about you
All day long
She pushes nine to save
But still can't erase 'cause --


It makes her feel close
Makes her smile
It's like he's with her almost
Til the tears take over
She's still in hell
But she tells herself
She's ready to let him go
Because that makes her feel close


It's just a worn out
Notre Dame t-shirt
She's gotten mad
And tried to throw that thing away
At least a hundred times
But she's got it on tonight
He used to wear it on the weekend
Just runnin' around
Probably forgot he even left it
Behind
She says it keeps her warm
Oh, but it's so much more


It makes her feel close
Makes her smile
It's like he's with her almost
Til the tears take over
She's still in hell
But she tells herself
She's ready to let him go
Because that makes her feel close


To saying goodbye, getting
On with her life
Maybe give love another try
One more try
Oh, one more try


It makes her feel close
Makes her smile
It's like he's with her almost
Til the tears take over
She's still in hell
But she tells herself
She's ready to let him go
Because that makes her feel close
It makes her feel close
Makes her feel close


It's just a worn out Notre
Dame t-shirt
She's gotten mad and tried
To throw that thing away
At least a hundred times
But she's got in on tonight


Jackknife, brake at the traffic stop
Interstate looking' like a parking' lot
Fat boy flying on a Fat Boy bike
Weaving' in and out and passing' me by


I honked my horn and shot the bird at that crazy SOB
Yeah, but deep down, I was wishing' it was me


But if I had one, I'd have to say
I'd probably do the same dang thing
Pull her to the shoulder and let that steel horse run
I'd be hell on wheels if I had one


Called my brother said, "How you've been?
We ain't been fishing' since I don't know when"
He said, "This graveyard shift's a graveyard grind
I got more bills than I got time"


I'd love to weigh the line but my wife just stay on my case
I said "I guess I know who wears the pants around your place"




Sitting' on a bar stool talking' to a lady
She's running' my tab up, calling' me baby
Buy her a drink she'll let you chase her
And watch her shake her money maker


Boy if I had one I'd have to say
I'd probably shake it the same damn way
Hike it up high 'cause I could get it, son
I'd never buy another beer if I had one
You know things would be different if I had one


That's what I'd do if I had one of those
I'd do it just like that, right there
Things would be different if I had one, too
But I don't, but if I had one, yeah buddy, ooh buddy

Never seen the Mona Lisa
Never walked across the moon
Never been to Casa Blanca
But I've been to Cancun
I'll never make the Fortune 500
On what I get paid

Please don't pity me
'Cause I've got everything I need

Life don't get no better
I could live forever and never top this
Oh, I'm in poll position
Got a sweet suspicion there ain't nothin'
I've missed
Baby look at us
Standing in the middle of this ultimate love

When I was seventeen I shook
Joe Namath's hand
Once I won karaoke singin' "Piano Man"
One time in Vegas I won me 700 bucks
That's all real cool stuff but it don't
Measure up

Life don't get no better
I could live forever and never top this
Oh, I'm in poll position
Got a sweet suspicion there ain't nothin'
I've missed
Baby look at us
Standing in the middle of this ultimate love

Well, I don't know too much, but I know this love
Is bigger than the both of us

Life don't get no better
I could live forever and never top this
Oh, I'm in poll position
Got a sweet suspicion that there ain't nothin'
I've missed
Baby look at us
Standing in the middle of this ultimate love
Love, love

I'm tired of spinning my wheels
I need to find a place where my heart can go to heal
I need to get there pretty quick
Hey mister what you got out on that lot you can sell me in a pinch

Maybe one of them souped up muscle cars
The kind that makes you think you're stronger than you are
Color don't matter no I don't need leather seats
All that really concerns me is

Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed

I'd like to trade in this old truck
Cause it makes me think of her and that just slows me up
See, it's the first place we made love where we used to sit and talk
On the tailgate all night long but now she's gone
And I need to move on
So give me

Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed

Throw me them keys so I can put some miles between us
Tear off that rearview mirror there's nothing left to see here
Let me lean on that gas
Oh she catches up fast
So give me

Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed

That's what I need
I'm tired of spinning my wheels
I'm tired of spinning my wheels


On your side of the bed, there's a picture of our wedding day
A clock that don't work and the bible that your daddy gave
It's on the window side, where the moon creeps in at night
Staring at the ceiling, lying here all alone
I said a prayer for you then I said one of my own
But you don't reach for me, when you lie down quietly


Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed


On your side of the bed there's a burned out candle flame
A letter I started but I didn't know what to say
No I couldn't write it down, so I'll try to say it now


Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed


Aren't you even going to make a sound?
Your side of the bed
Turn the other way when I turn the lights down
Your side of the bed
Are you lonely? Like I'm lonely?


How, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed


On your side of the bed
Are you still awake, on your side of the bed


I see her laying by the poolside every day
She ain't got a lot on
She ain't got a lot to say


She wouldn't look my way
But buddy, what do you expect
I'm just the fix-it-up boy at the apartment complex


And she'll go out dancing' 'bout 7:15
Climb into the back of a long limousine
I know where she's going
She's going downtown
I'm going downtown, too, and take a look around


See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm trying hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man


I'm just sitting 'round waiting on a telephone call
After water pipe exploded in the living room wall
If your washer and dryer in need of repair
You know the handyman's waiting
And he'll be right there


Twenty-four hours
Seven days a week
If it's getting clogged up or maybe starting to leak
Just ring up my number, baby, give me a try
You know I got all the tools
And I can satisfy

See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't asked her out yet
'Cause I don't know if I can
You see a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man, man


See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm trying hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man
Ain't no high maintenance woman
Gonna fall for a maintenance man, no

Stars on the river
Stars in the sky
Stars that are falling
Stars burning bright
Stars disappearing
Stars come to light out of the dark

I see stars in every headlight
And I wonder where they go
I see stars that are stranded by the side of the road
I see stars that look like raindrops sticking to the hood of my car
I'm seeing stars

Wishing on stars
Only when you see 'em
Is like asking God for help
Only when you need it
But I'm wishing anyway
I'm wishing anyway
Wishing on stars
Only when you see 'em
Is like asking God for help
Only when you need it
But I'm wishing anyway
I'm wishing anyway

Tonight there's stars on the river
Stars in the sky
Stars that are faded like the stars in her eyes
One lonely tear drop
One long goodbye
Hit me hard
I'm seeing stars

Wishing on stars
Only when you see 'em
Is like asking God for help
Only when you need it
But I'm wishing anyway
I'm wishing anyway

I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars
(Stars on the river, stars in the sky)
I'm seeing stars


Got Little Wayne pumping on my iPod
Thumping on the subs in the back of my crew cab
Redneck rocking like a rockstar
Sling a little mud off the back, we can do that
Friday night football, Saturday Last Call, Sunday Hallelujah
If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud
Then you know what I'm talking about


Let me hear you say, Truck Yeah
Wanna get it jacked up yeah

We can love it on up yeah
'Till the sun comes up yeah
And if you think this life I love is a little too country
Truck Yeah


Our party in the club is a honky tonk downtown
Yeah that's where I like to hang out
Chilling in the back room
Hanging with my whole crew
Sipping on a cold brew, hey now!
Got a mixed up playlist, DJ play this
Wanna hear a country song
If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud
Throw your hands up now, let me hear you shout


Truck Yeah
Wanna get it jacked up yeah

Let me hear you say, Truck Yeah
Wanna get it jacked up yeah
Let's crank it on up yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up yeah
'Till the sun comes up yeah
And if you think this life I love is a little too country
Truck Yeah

You picked me up at seven
I could see it in your eyes
And halfway through the movie
It was still on both our minds
So why put it off one minute more
Let's do what we wanted to
When I first opened the door

Kiss me now...cause you know you will
Kiss me now...why wait until
The end of the night when it's awkward and shy
And there's so much at stake that we're too scared to try
Kiss me now...why go on like this
Kiss me now...get it over with
I'll make it easy on you
I want you to
Kiss me now

The way we're both distracted
It makes it hard to talk
This ice is easily broken
If we trust in what we've got

Kiss me now...cause you know you will
Kiss me now...why wait until
The end of the night when it's awkward and shy
And there's so much at stake that we're too scared to try
Kiss me now...why go on like this
Kiss me now...get it over with
I'll make it easy on you
I want you to
Kiss me now

You don't have to ask...you know what I'll say
And who knows what will happen next
If we get it out of the way

Kiss me now...why go on like this
Kiss me now...get it over with
I'll make it easy on you
I want you to
Kiss me now

She's a warm summer breeze with bleach blonde hair
Like a fine red wine she can take you there
She's a walk in the sand at sunset
She's the top pulled down on the 405
She'll take you higher than Humbolt sky
She's an earthquake
And you're the fault line
So, when you feel the ground, start movin' around
Hold on tight you're in for a ride


Cause she's so California
She's a wild fire out of control, headed for ya
So, when you get burned, don't say I didn't warn ya
Cause she's so California

She's a black Mercedes on Laurel and Vine
She's a low cut dress
She's a Hollywood sign
She's a dead head on a Friday night
Oh, and she's so cool, breaking all the rules
Rising star, she'll break your heart



She's so California


There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening
In a conversation, 'bout the way things use to be
I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door
I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor
Hanging onto every word
Man, the things I heard
It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school uphill both ways
We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor
Course that was back before the war
Yea your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say


That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of


Son graduating college, that was momma's dream
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned Eighteen
That's when you got a fast car, and think you got everything
I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith
I ended up broke down in some town north of L.A
Working maximum hours, for minimum wage
I fell in love next thing I know
Babies came and the car got sold
Sure do miss that old Hot Rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
Dad I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said let me tell you right now


That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
No need to make a million just be thankful to be working
If you're doing what you're able
Putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of


And if all you ever really do is the best you can...
Well, you did it man


That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
Now that's something to be proud of

6 A.M and Bobby's wakin' up
Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes
Goes to his sister's room across the hall
"Hey Daisy rise and shine"
He pours two bowls full of Captain Crunch
Puts a fresh pot of coffee on
He wakes his momma up off the couch
"The bus is here, we love you mom"

He made the breakfast
He did the dishes
So she wouldn't have to

Oh he's only ten
Just comin' of age he oughta be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike
Just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house

It's late at night and Larry King is on
Momma's up on the couch again
Bobby hears them all talk about
That awful war his daddy's in
So he runs off, straight up to his room
Don't want his momma to see him right now
He climbs in bed and says a silent prayer
Then he cries his little blue eyes out
Don't wanna let her down

Oh he's only ten
Just comin' of age he oughta be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike
Just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house

It's finally Saturday
Bobby gets a phone call
Another world away from home
He says, "I love you dad"
Daddy says it right back
"Wish I could reach through this phone
And hug you, and Daisy, and your mom
I'm so proud of you son."

He's only ten
Just comin' of age he oughta to be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike
Just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house

It's 6 A.M and Bobby's wakin' up
Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes

If you see me hold my hand over my heart
Before I start the Pledge of Allegiance
There's a reason
It's to honor those who died

And if you see me close my eyes and bow my head
Before I break bread with my family
It ain't a habit, it's important
It's my right

I work half the year for me
The other half for Uncle Sam
While he's bailin' out those sinkin' ships
And drownin' the little man

I watch the news and have to wonder
If this country's goin' crazy
Talkin' 'bout how much they love it here
But how they want to rearrange it

I'm just your Average Joe
And that makes me smart enough to know
There's a bunch of us out here
That feel the same

Wanna keep our God, our freedom
A little money in the bank

Y'all can keep the change

Now the fat cats on the hill actin' so brilliant
Ain't smart enough to notice
That we're angry
And that America's in trouble

If they don't wise-up and stop
Bustin' out the blocks that were laid
As a foundation, well, our nation
Could wake up in a pile of ruble

They say we're makin' progress
But it's a big old shame to me
Common sense ain't near as common
As it used to be

I watch the news and have to wonder
If this country's goin' crazy
Talkin' 'bout how much they love it here
But how they want to rearrange it

Well, I'm just your Average Joe
And that makes me smart enough to know
There's a bunch of us out here
That feel the same

Wanna keep our God, our freedom
A little money in the bank

Y'all can keep the change

I bet our grandpas are gettin' dizzy
Down there in their graves
Rollin' over and over
Over what's goin' on these days

I watch the news and have to wonder
If this country's goin' crazy
Talkin' 'bout how much they love it here
But how they want to rearrange it

I'm just your Average Joe
And that makes me smart enough to know
There's a bunch of us out here
That feel the same

Gonna keep our God, our freedom
A little money in the bank

Y'all can keep the change

Just keep the change
Y'all can keep the change

I guess I'm just a little bit scared I guess I'm not a strong as I thought
When I see you lying there I worry about losing you
I used to think of only me but that was long ago
Now I find it hard to conceive life without you

Baby I don't want to be the one to face this life all alone
At the end of the day when the sun goes down
I want you right here in my arms... forever
Every little smile every move you make
It's like a dagger to my heart took my breath away
All I ask is that you be mine forever... forever

Think about what you're doing here
If you're anything less than sincere
Tell me now and let yourself out the door
No harm no foul, kill me now, save me all the pain
But if you feel the way I do stay
Let me make love to you

Baby I don't want to be the one to face this life all alone
At the end of the day when the sun goes down
I want you right here in my arms... forever
Every little smile every move you make
It's like a dagger to my heart took my breath away
All I ask is that you be mine forever... forever

Forever

Baby I don't want to be the one to face this life all alone
At the end of the day when the sun goes down
I want you right here in my arms... forever
Every little smile every move you make
It's like a dagger to my heart took my breath away
All I ask is that you be mine forever... forever

Forever, forever, forever

Guess I'm just a little bit scared
I guess I'm not as strong as I thought
When I see you lying there


She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got


If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you


The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then


If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you


Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard


If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you

She was there in the stands
Come rain or come shine
She was the lady that smiled all the time
I know times were hard, but she never let on
No, it wasn't easy
But she was so strong

And she believed in me
When I just gave up
She took all my worries
And she gave me love
She rocked me to sleep
With a sweet lullaby
I thank God for that woman in my life

So many bruises
And young broken hearts
And ill-fated arrows that all missed their marks
And I found a lover, like there's never been
She's my baby's mother
And she's my best friend

And she believes in me
When I just give up
She takes all my worries
And she gives me love
Yeah, she rocks me to sleep
With a sweet lullaby
I thank God for this woman in my life

Now she's two years old
And she's my biggest fan
And I'm wrapped 'round the fingers
Of her little hand

And she believes in me
When I just give up
She takes all my worries
And she gives me love
Yeah, I rock her to sleep
With a sweet lullaby
I thank God for this woman in my life
Oh, I thank God for this woman in my life

"No ablo Espannol"
Was all I knew of the local lingo
That old pocket guide to Mexico
Wasn't much help to this out of place Gringo
When I checked into my motel room
Was helped by a brown-eyed senorita:
She said: "Buen venidos, Senor: blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
"Como esta. Buenos dias."
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said:
"Boy you won't ever forget it."
They that Spanish is the language of love
Well, I love that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it

As I followed her down the hallway
I was tryin' my best not to stare
The angel before me was a rare beauty indeed
Jay-Lo had nothin' on her
She winked an' she smiled at me sweetly
Said: "Senor, a qui esta sou mas vez
"Muy bappo," an' somethin' 'bout "ho ho's."
An' I thought: "Oh, baby, whatever you say."

I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said:
"Boy you won't ever forget it."
They that Spanish is the language of love
Well, I love that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it

Later that evenin' in a local cantina
A Mariachi band was playin'
She held me close so her body would know
That my body knew what she was sayin'

I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said:
"Boy you won't ever forget it."
They that Spanish is the language of love
Well, I love that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
No, I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it


I catch myself wishing
You were whispering my name
Every star, every scar
Every mark upon my heart
Up and fades away
I feel myself missing
Everything I threw away
Every dream, every scene
Every song we'd ever sing
Got lost in yesterday


I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight


Do you find yourself wondering
If I still think about you
Every thought, every step
Every tear and every breath
I swear I do
Yeah, that's all I ever do


I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight


Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
If I can kiss you tonight
If I could kiss you tonight


T minus 3, 2, 1
Ignition


She walked up, said she needed a drink
I said whatcha want, she said, whatcha think?
I took a sip and we were slipping away
To a little corner table to the left of the stage
It was just some random night in July
No, there wasn't no fireworks up in the sky
Thought it was nothing, we were just having fun
Next thing you know


(Three, two, one) We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pocket
Sun coming up, couldn't stop it (Woah, woah)
When she talked, I just wanted to listen
Just like that we were kissin'
Whenever I get to reminiscin'
I think about how it started out
As a what's up, catch a buzz
Talkin' bout whatever, ended up being the best night ever


We were there, till they closed down the bar
Then we spent a couple hours leaning up on your car
Watched the stars fade out, my head on your shoulder
Saying baby, please don't let it be over
I've been everywhere all over this town, tryin' to recreate it
But I never found, whatever it was, whatever we had
No nothing no, nothing's gonna ever top that


We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pocket
Sun coming up, couldn't stop it (Woah, woah)
When she talked, I just wanted a little listen
Just like that we were kissin'
Whenever I get to reminiscin'
I think about how it started out
As a what's up, catch a buzz
Talkin' bout whatever, ended up being the best night ever


Wasn't even trying to fall in love
But just like that, 3-2-1


We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pocket
Sun coming up couldn't stop it (Woah, woah)
When she talked, I just wanted a little listen
Just like that we were kissin'
Whenever I get to reminiscin'
I think about how it started out
As a what's up, catch a buzz
Talkin' bout whatever, ended up being
The best night
What's up, catch a buzz
Talkin' 'bout whatever, ended up being
The best night ever


(Woah) best night ever
Woah, woah
(Woah, woah) Best night ever

Girl you got me going
Yea I think you know it
Oh I'm ready for this ride
So come on take my hand
Cuz only you, you understand
How to kick this feeling into

Drive all night with me
Sing my favorite song and sleep
Under the stars on the hood of our car
It's all I've ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to
See you in the pale moon light
Just the way ya look tonight
And maybe some day
If love comes our way
We'll be walking in the meadow in the early spring
You'll be twirling in a sundress wearing my ring
Can you see it
Girl I believe em that
It's true
All I ever wanted
All I ever really wanted was you

If life is what you make it
Here's my chance ill take it
You know I wanna make you mine
I have this picture in my mind
You were in it all the time
So baby hold on tight

And drive all night with me
Sing my favorite song and sleep
Under the stars on the hood of our car
It's all I've ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to
See you in the pale moon light
Just the way ya look tonight
And maybe some day
If love comes our way
We'll be walking in the meadow in the early spring
You'll be twirling in a sundress wearing my ring
Can you see it
Girl I believe em that
It's true
All I ever wanted
All I ever really wanted was you

All I ever wanted
Was to see you in the pale moon light
Just the way ya look tonight
And maybe some day
If love comes our way
We'll be walking in the meadow in the early spring
You'll be twirling in a sundress wearing my ring
Can you see it
Girl I believe em that
It's true
All I ever wanted
All I ever really wanted was you


There's something 'bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay
We were crazy then we were over
We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster


Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you


There’s something in the bittersweet
The feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment
All I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying when they played it


Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh I still think about you


There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
I think about you and me


Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you
I still think about you
Yeah, I still think about you


There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody

I tell you what, we're in a rut, we're in a deep rut
So habitual, predictable I tell you what we oughta do
We oughta drive away, fly away, find a way to get away
We need a break from the same old, same old nothin' new
Wanna go out on a limb, on a whim, yeah
That's the kind of mood I'm in

Let's go somewhere, nowhere we've heard of
Hang the sign out, "Do not disturb us"
Get a wake up call about three p.m
That's the kind of mood I'm in
A little shake up, take the chain and rattle it
Try to catch the wind and saddle it
Fall in love all over again, yeah
That's the kind of mood I'm in

I tell you this, I want a kiss, I want a long kiss
The kind of deep down, move the ground thing you used to do to me
I wanna dance a little, dream a little, baby, just live a little
Make my heart rate elevate, bring it up a few degrees
Get me gone with the wind, now and then, yeah
That's the kind of mood I'm in

Let's go somewhere, nowhere we've heard of
Hang the sign out, "Do not disturb us"
Get a wake up call about three p.m
That's the kind of mood I'm in
A little shake up, take the chain and rattle it
Try to catch the wind and saddle it
Fall in love all over again, yeah
That's the kind of mood I'm in

Any hemisphere, change of atmosphere
Get me outta here right now

Let's go somewhere, nowhere we've heard of
Hang the sign out, "Do not disturb us"
Get a wake up call about three p.m
That's the kind of mood I'm in
A little shake up, take the chain and rattle it
Try to catch the wind and saddle it
Fall in love all over again, yeah
That's the kind of mood I'm in


Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale


Time slows down
Whenever you're around


Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale


Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale


Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah


But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale


Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down


But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way


But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale


Today was a fairytale


We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "hello"
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "please don't go," and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Oh, oh


I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring


And said: "Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'"


Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Because we were both young when I first saw you


Church bells ringing on our wedding day
Climbed in that limo and rode away
Guess you'll always hear some people say
Man, they're never going to make it

We settled in and we settled down
In this quiet little seaside town
You are the rock I built my world around
And life will never break it


We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And we are two, true believers


It wasn't easy getting here today
Sometimes you stumbled or I lost my way
But every roadblock was a chance to say
Take my hand I'm here beside you

We worked and made it through the toughest parts
Now every day is another chance to start
To look around and see where we are
It's where we were trying to get to




We are one before our God in Heaven
Oh, we are one road when the going gets rough
We are one now and forever
We are one name, one life, one flame



Her little blond hair's blowin', she's swingin' while her daddy's mowin'
The grass, and the dog needs a bath
But he's chasing the cat up a tree
I'm lookin' out the window, happy just watching my world go round
And I think to myself, how lucky can a girl be

I've got everything, more than I ever dreamed
I love my life
I thank God for all I have
And that I love this man
Who loves his wife
I love my life
I love my life

Twenty kisses goodnight, turn the little butterfly night light on
'til the monster is gone and she's finally fallen asleep
We tiptoe downstairs, cuddle up and we kiss in the big chair
And I smile and you whisper, now it's just you and me

I've got everything, more than I ever dreamed
I love my life
I thank God for all I have
And that I love this man
Who loves his wife
I love my life
I love my life

Blue and pink in the nursery
Gold and silver anniversaries
Dancing in the living room
Our little girl, and me and you

I've got everything, more than I ever dreamed
I love my life
I thank God for all I have
And that I love this man
Who loves his wife
I love my life
I love my life


My dearest son, it's almost June
I hope this letter catches up with you and finds you well
It's been dry but they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same ol' in Johnsonville
Your stubborn ol' daddy ain't said too much
But I'm sure you know he sends his love
And she goes on, In a letter from home


I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared
And our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh like there's something funny
'Bout the way I talk, when mama sends her best y'all
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home


My dearest love, it's almost dawn
I've been layin' here all night long
Wonderin' where you might be
I saw your mama and I showed her the ring
Man on the television said something
So I couldn't sleep
But I'll be alright, I'm just missin' you
And this is me kissin' you
X's and O's in a letter from home


I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh cause she calls me honey
But they take it hard, 'cause I don't read the good parts
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home


Dear son, I know I ain't written
And sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen
It occurs to me I might not have said it, so I'll say it now
Son, you make me proud


I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs
'Cause ain't nothin' funny when a soldier cries
And I just wipe my eyes
I fold it up and put in my shirt get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

You ain't even trying but everything stops when you walk in a room
Tell me how you do it
You make me want to fall just looking at you

The sound of your voice and the touch of your skin
Sending chills up my spine
The taste of your lips, the spell of your kiss
I can't deny

There's something 'bout you and all the little things that you do
Girl I can't explain it
No matter how hard I try to put my finger on it
There's just something 'bout you
Something 'bout you got me feeling something brand new
I think I'm going crazy
It's more than just your mind, it's more than just your body, baby
It's just something 'bout

Caught up in a moment
Lost in the way that you're looking at me
You don't even know it
If you could only see what you're doing to me

The sound of your voice and the touch of your skin
Sending chills up my spine
The taste of your lips, the spell of your kiss
I can't deny

There's something 'bout you and all the little things that you do
Girl I can't explain it
No matter how hard I try to put my finger on it
There's just something 'bout you
Something 'bout you got me feeling something brand new
I think I'm going crazy
It's more than just your mind, it's more than just your body, baby
There's just something 'bout you

Maybe it's the way that you touch me
Maybe it's the way that you look tonight
Something I can't understand but I know I can't live without

There's something 'bout you and all the little things that you do
Girl I can't explain it
No matter how hard I try to put my finger on it
There's just something 'bout you
Something 'bout you got me feeling something brand new
I think I'm going crazy
It's more than just your mind, its more than just your body, baby
There's just something 'bout you

Just something 'bout you baby

Floorboard's filled with baby toys
And empty coke bottles and coffee cups
Driving through the rain with no radio
Trying not to wake her up

Cell phone says "low battery"
God, what if I break down?
I'm just looking for an exit with a lotta lights
A safe little interstate town

Just a cheap hotel
With a single bed
And cable TV
Is good enough for me and Emily

Someday when she's old enough
She's gonna start asking questions about him
Some kid at school brings his Dad for show and tell
And gets her little mind a-wondering
"Where's my Daddy?
Do I have one?
Does he not love me like you do?"

Oh, maybe I'll find someone
To love the both of us
And I'll tell her
When she's old enough to know the truth

Will it break her heart?
Will she understand
That I had to leave?
That's what was best for me and Emily

That house was never clean enough
His dinner never warm enough
Nothing I did was ever good enough to make him happy
So I guess he gave me what he thought I deserved
But it would kill me if he ever raised his hand to her

Big rigs are throwing rain on my windshield
And I feel like they're laughing at me
Finally the storm is lettin' up
And the morning is breaking free

It's a brand new day
It's a second chance
Yesterday is just a memory
For me and Emily

Floorboard is filled with baby toys
And empty coke bottles and coffee cups
Least there's one good thing that he gave me
And she's starting to wake up

Hehehahahaha...


Don't make me come over there and love you
I'd be beside you in a single bound
Don't make me come over there and love you
'Cause I will right now


I don't need any explanation
For why I crave all your honey talk
Don't make me come over there and love you
'Cause it's a short walk


You better tone down your persuasion
Start behaving before I go and fall apart


My heart's been on a long vacation
But now it's beating like a cha, cha, cha
Don't make me come over there and love you
'Cause I will right now




Don't make me come over there and love you
Because it's looking like the perfect spot
Don't make me come over there and love you
And give all I got


Don't make me come over there and love you
'Cause I will right now
Yes, I will right now
Don't make me come over there and love you


I get kissed by the sun
Each morning
Put my feet on a hardwood floor
I get to hear my children laughing
Down the hall through the
Bedroom door
Sometimes I sit on my
Front porch swing
Just soaking up the day
I think to myself, I think to myself
This world is a beautiful place


I have been blessed
And I feel like I've found my way
I thank God for all I've been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones
That love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed


Across a crowded room
I know you know what I'm thinking
By the way I look at you
And when we're lying in the quiet
And no words have to be said
I think to myself, I think to myself
This love is a beautiful gift




When I'm singing my kids to sleep
When I feel you holding me
I know



She burns too hot, plays too rough
She's got a dress full of dangerous stuff
The way she looks tears me apart
But the way she loves me nearly stops my heart

If her lovin' don't kill me
Don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill
If her lovin' don't kill me then nothing will

My doctor told me I looked kinda ragged
He said: "What happened, boy? Did you fall off the wagon?"
I said: "It ain't my drinkin' or my smokin' doc
"It's my drop dead darlin' rockin' me around the clock."

If her lovin' don't kill me
Don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill
If her lovin' don't kill me then nothing will

Ev'ry night, she tears me up
She gives it good and I can't get enough

And if her lovin' don't kill me
Don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill
If her lovin' don't kill me then nothing will

If her lovin' don't kill me
Don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill
If her lovin' don't kill me
Then I swear nothin' ever will

Nothin', nothin' will
(If her lovin' don't kill me.)
I'm invincible
(If her lovin' don't kill me.)
If her lovin' don't kill me
(If her lovin' don't kill me.)
(If her lovin' don't kill me.)
(If her lovin' don't kill me.)
(If her lovin' don't kill me.)

Oooh
Oh, oh

Let me tell you now
This field ain't ever been plowed
But that don't mean it can't
It just ain't happened yet
But, baby, you seem to see past the weeds
So before you take a chance on me
Let me warn you what you're gonna get

It's gonna be a hard row, but it'll be worth it
'Cause I know, underneath the surface
What's a-waiting if you dig a little deeper down
Keep doin' what you're doin', patiently
'Cause nothin' worth growin' comes easily
Lovin' me's gonna be like workin' unbroken ground

I guess you could say that I've been the one to blame
'Cause I'm the one that built this fence
Keepin' people out of my heart
Baby, you somehow got to me
An' found a way to plant a seed
So let me say, before you go too far

That it's gonna be a hard row, but it'll be worth it
'Cause I know, underneath the surface
What's a-waiting if you dig a little deeper down
So keep doin' what you're doin', patiently
'Cause nothin' worth growin' comes easily
Lovin' me's gonna be like workin' unbroken ground

Oh, it's gonna be a hard row, but it'll be worth it
'Cause I know, underneath the surface
What's a-waiting if you dig a little deeper down
So keep doin' what you're doin', patiently
'Cause nothin' worth growin' comes easily
Lovin' me's gonna be like workin' unbroken ground

Ooh, lovin' me's gonna be like workin' unbroken ground

Mmm
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)
Oooh, keep doin' what you're doin

(La, la, la, la la.)
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)
Ooh baby
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)
Workin' unbroken ground
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)

(La, la, la, la, la.)
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)
Workin' unbroken ground
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)

(La, la, la, la, la.)
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)
Ooh baby
(La, la, la, la, la, la.)
Workin' unbroken ground
(La, la, la, la, la, la...)

I hear people sayin'. We Don't need this war
But I say there's some things worth fightin' for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep em' by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're gettin in
Before you start your preachin' let me ask you this my friend

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And you say we shouldn't worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbin for you and me
It'll just breed anger is what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out lookin' for a fight
Well after 9-11 man I'd have to say that's right

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And we vow to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

I'v been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten
All the people killed
Yes some went down like heroes
In that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten
About our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden

Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?!

I always get the door for a lady, I don’t care if she’s 4 or if she’s 80
I don’t need a Jag, I got a tractor,I won’t apologize for things that matter
Pop a cold beer after five, drop everything go wet a line
I believe in the USA, 4 wheel drives and Jesus Saves

Freaks like me, just outside of the in crowd
Freaks like me, out of style and damn proud
Raise a hand, ‘cause I’m a fan
Of everyone who has turned out to be
Freaks like me

Yeah, I can’t seem to smell or tell the difference
Between a pile of bull or a pile of politicians
Give me old folks and old boots
And Deep fried and deep roots and
Six packs and six strings and two dollar blue jeans

Freaks like me, just outside of the in crowd
Freaks like me, out of style and damn proud
Raise a hand, ‘cause I’m a fan
Of everyone who has turned out to be
Freaks like me
Freaks like me

Pop a cold beer after five
I believe in the USA, 4 Wheel Drives and Jesus Saves

Freaks like me, just outside of the in crowd
Freaks like me, out of style and damn proud
Raise a hand, ‘cause I’m a fan
Of everyone who has turned out to be
Freaks like me
Freaks like me
What you get is what you see
Freaks like me
Yeah, freaks like me

I stood there in the middle of the church of the broken people
Listened to the walking wounded tell their stories
My turn came I told 'em my name. I said this ain't my first time
Then a man started talking how the devil and the bottle was ruining my life
With last night on my breath I stood up and said...

It ain't the whiskey
It ain't the cigarettes
It ain't the stuff I smoke
It's all these things I can't forget
It ain't the hard times
It ain't the all nights
It ain't that easy
It ain't the whiskey that's killin' me

So what do you got for this empty spot inside of me?
The deep dark hole where love used to be
Before she ripped it out and ran into the arms of someone else
Y'all sit in this room and you talk like you got some kind of remedy
Well I hear what you're telling me
But I've got all the proof I need

It ain't the whiskey
It ain't the cigarettes
It ain't the stuff I smoke
It's all these things I can't forget
It ain't the hard times
It ain't the all nights
It ain't that easy
Cause it ain't the whiskey that's killin' me

I've done everything to drown this hurt inside
But I can't wash you off of my mind

It ain't the whiskey
It ain't the cigarettes
It ain't the stuff I smoke
It's all these things I can't forget
It ain't the hard times
It ain't the all nights
It ain't that easy
Cause it ain't the whiskey that's killin' me

It ain't the whiskey that's killin' me


They used to call me lightning
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song

I met a dark haired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yea


Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun


She was sitting on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac DeVille
He grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said no free rides for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for, no

She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
Said if you're dumb enough to chase us, man
You're dumb enough to die


Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun, yeah


We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're running from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came to a town
With a name I could not spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel

I woke up to sirens
And the sound of running feet
There were fifty Federales
Locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my .44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back

Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
There's only one thing left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air


Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun

Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun


Saw a man in the movies that didn't have a heart
How I wish I could give him mine
Then I wouldn't have to feel it breaking all apart
And this emptiness inside would suit me fine


It's times like these
I wish I were a tin man
You could hurt me all you wanted
And I'd never even know
I'd give anything just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart and I wouldn't need a soul


I couldn't see your leaving coming
You took me by surprise
Even now it still seems like a dream
But I know I can't be dreaming
Because as I lay down each night
The pain so great that it won't let me sleep


It's times like these
I wish I were a tin man
You could hurt me all you wanted
And I'd never even know
I'd give anything just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart and I wouldn't need a soul
Well I'd give anything just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart and I wouldn't miss you so


I have been dragging' around your sensitive ego
Making sure that your bags arrive on time for the dog and pony show
A little suitcase like a brick
It kinda makes it hard to get a good grip
I drop your troubles off at the conveyor belt
I'll hand you a ticket to go get it yourself


At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
I'm packing' it in, so come and get it


If it ain't obvious what has set me off today
Behind every woman scorned is a man who made her that way
Go on and take your little business trip
With that sweet little habit that you can't kick
You better call your momma when you get to town
Cause I ain't gonna be hanging' around


At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
I'm packing' it in, so come and get it


Come and get it!


Come and pick it up, pick it up
Before I blow it up in flames
You better pick it up, pick it up
Baby, I'm leaving everything


At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
I'm packing' it in, so come and get it


Come and get your shit!

Home is where my heart is still beating
I don't know when I'll see her again
I hate to see her cry when I'm leaving
But now I'm a thousand miles away again

She feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks back I'm behind her
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away
She feels like Carolina

It's hard to understand the way I'm living
I know she thinks I'm never coming home (never coming home)
But I miss her pretty smile, and I'm coming back in a little while
But I'm a thousand miles away again

She feels like Carolina (feels like Carolina)
Looks like California (looks like California)
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks back I'm behind her
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away
She makes me feel like home's not so far away

No matter how far I go, you know I can't stop thinking about her
And there's nothing like the way I feel, the way I feel when I'm beside her
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

She feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
She feels like Carolina (feels like Carolina)
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway

When she looks back I'm behind her (feels like Carolina)
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away

Carolina
California

Like home's not so far away

She feels like Carolina (feels like Carolina)
Looks like California
She makes me feel like home's not so far away
She makes me feel like home (so far away)
She makes me feel like home's not so far away


This morning is Monday
Where are you now
Teasing my memory
Teaching me how to lay low
When I don't want to

Your love is elusive
This I know now
It's making me crazy
Leaving me out in the open
When I don't want to


Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down
More than I've already been

Just like a wildfire
You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby
I should be ashes by now


The moment of pleasure
Just never do last
They're gone like a suitcase
Full of your past
Long gone and in a hurry




You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby
I should be ashes by now

Just like a wildfire
You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby


I should be ashes by now

Ooooo, ashes by now
Ooooo, ashes by now

As much as you burn me, baby
I should be ashes by now

You were a whip around town
Tinted windows down
Alabama bound
Dixieland delight

You were a summer silhouette
A Sunday cigarette
A hand me down cassette
A turn on a dirt road dime

You were a rock that
Thrown back
George Strait tee too tight

Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
It's like the record stopped spinning
And you're gone again and
I'm stuck here alone
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
I turn it up, you turn me on
It takes me back
It takes all night long

I'm the Jack without the rocks
A sun without a drop
A quarter in the slot of an unplugged jukebox joint
And I'm a Gibson missin' all of my damn strings

Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
It's like the record stopped spinning
And you're gone again and
I'm stuck here alone
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
I turn it up, you turn me on
It takes me back
It takes all night long

Yeah it hard to admit it
Your boy is addicted
As soon as I hit it, it plays and I miss it
And now I'm tied to a train
Down memory lane
Stuck on repeat
Repeat the same old same

Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
It's like the record stopped spinning
And you're gone again and
I'm stuck here alone
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
I turn it up, you turn me on
It takes me back
It takes all night long

Yeah it hard to admit it
Your boy is addicted
As soon as I hit it, it plays and I miss it
And now I'm tied to a train
Down memory lane
Stuck on repeat
Repeat the same old same

Can't get you out of my head, girl
Can't get you out of my head

Put on my high heels
My little red dress
And sugar cookie perfume
And I don't care if you know I'm trying
It's time that you got a clue

You say you wish
That you could find a girl like me
It's hilarious
How obvious can one girl be?

Yeah, it might feel a little bit funny at first
But I promise we can figure it out
Let me show you tonight
That it's time we stop messing around
Kiss me now, kiss me now

I see you smiling
I catch you staring
More than a friend would do
I'm dropping hints like
Like it's my job
Why, why you keep playing it cool?

Did you call me over just so we could hang out?
Boy, this little game you're playing
Is really freaking me out

Yeah, it might feel a little bit funny at first
But I promise we can figure it out
Let me show you tonight
That it's time we stop messin' around
Kiss me now, kiss me now

I know, I know
I get it
You're the gentleman type
But lean a little closer
Let me change your mind

Yeah, it might feel a little bit funny at first
But I promise we can figure it out
Let me show you tonight
That it's time we stop messin' around

Yeah, it might feel a little bit funny at first
But I promise we can figure it out
Let me show you tonight
That it's time we stop messin' around
Kiss me now

Kiss me now
Kiss me now
Kiss me now


I didn't see it coming
The kiss was so unpredictable
And maybe it's the mystery
In you that I'm addicted to it
It's overrated knowing somebody so well
It takes away the fire, yeah


It's funny when you tell me you don't think you're all that interesting
I beg to differ, with you I'm out here on the edge of my seat
And every minute guessing, holding my breath you're fueling that fire


And baby, you're my wild card
My perfect little twist of fate
You're my first spark, shot in the dark
Favorite part of everything
And baby, you're a sweet surprise
Lucky like a shooting star
You're a strong, free, just what I need, wild card
Hey, yeah


I'm an unsuspecting dreamer
Just marching through my every day
You don't follow any leaders
You make your mark, and make a change
You could see that I was living, oh
But baby, now I'm living the life, yeah


You can blame it on the gravity
The reason that I'm falling
But the truth is I would jump
And girlm you're everything I've wanted
It's a revelation, yeah, kind of elevation
Learning to fly


And baby, you're my wild card
My perfect little twist of fate
You're my first spark, shot in the dark
Favorite part of everything
And baby, you're a sweet surprise
Lucky like a shooting star
You're a strong, free, just what I need, wild card
Yeah


You're my wild card
Got me happy like a holiday
Out of the blue, been waiting on you, praying for you every day


And baby, you're a sweet surprise
Looking like a superstar
You're a strong, free, just what I need, wild card


(All I need)
(All I needed)
Oh, baby!
All I need
All I needed
You're my wildcard
Baby, you're my wild card
You're my wildcard
Baby, you're my wild card


He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone


But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me


September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe


When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me


And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"


When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me
Mmmm


He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"

A little baby told God
Hey I'm kinda scared, don't really know if
I wanna go down there
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball
But that's a great big place and I'm so small

Why can't I just stay here with you?
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?'
And God said, 'Oh child, of course I do
But there's somebody special that's waiting for you'

So hush now baby don’t you cry
Cuz there’s someone down there waiting who’s only goal in life
Is making you sure you’re always going to be alright
A loving angel tender tough and strong
It’s almost time to go and meet your Mom

Now when she’s talking to you
Make sure you listen close
Cause she’s gonna teach everything you’ll ever need to know
Like how to mind your manners to love and laugh and dream
And she’ll put you on the path that’ll bring you back to me

So hush now baby don’t you cry
Cuz there’s someone down there waiting who’s only goal in life
Is making you sure you’re always going to be alright
A loving angel tender tough and strong
Come on child it’s time to meet your Mom

I got a little game that I play
And I call it "Try to beat the morning paper home"
I ain't very good but I get a lot of practice
Even won once a month ago
Of course there was a girl involved that wasn't gonna let me rest
But I've always said I can sleep when I'm dead


If there's somethin' goin' on within a hundred miles from home
Ya gonna hear my V-8 sing
Long as I can beat the train and they got a passing lane
Baby, I ain't gonna miss a thing
Life's too fun and I'm too young and the night ain't over yet
Like I said I can sleep when I'm dead

It ain't no fun if ya ain't got money
So I always make it in to work
The trick is to leave at least a half an hour
To brush my teeth and change my shirt
Keep a closet full of Red Bull and Visine to hide the red
I don't need the rest, I can sleep when I'm dead


When I get tired, I'll go to bed
All that I can say is that it hasn't happened yet

If there's somethin' goin' on within a hundred miles from home
Ya gonna hear my V-8 sing
Long as I can beat the train and they got a passing lane
Baby, I ain't gonna miss a thing
Life's too fun and I'm too young and the night ain't over yet
Like I said I can sleep when I'm dead
Like I said
Like I said
I can sleep when I'm dead

(I ain't even tired yet)


Well my heart didn't skip a beat
When I saw you standing there
Looking like some kind of angel
Like you were walking on air
And the earth didn't move
When you first said my name, I didn't feel a thing
No, not me
My heart didn't skip a beat


This ain't no love song
I just felt like getting my guitar on
And singing a tune, singing about you, yeah
Feeling good and tapping my shoes
And all this stuff I'm making up
Well, you probably won't be hearing it on the radio
But then you never know
So baby if you want, you can sing along, but this ain't no love song


I couldn't sleep last night
But you weren't on my mind
And I went for a drive last night
But if you saw me driving by
Well, I must have took a wrong turn
I must have been thinking something else
Had a melody in my head
Yeah, maybe that's why I couldn't sleep last night




Love song
Love song
Sing it to, you baby
Sing it to you baby, all night long


Yeah half this stuff I'm making up
Well, you probably won't be hearing it on the radio
But then you never know
So baby if you want, you can sing along, but this ain't no love song


Love song
Love song
This ain't no love song

If I Could Take it All and change it take the past and rearrange it i would baby yes i would
If i could figure out the reason go back in time and change the season i would baby yes i would
And I'd be the man you can't live with out i would Rewrite the parts
And turn you back around
I would do anything to bring you back but it's all over and you're gone and i just can't do that

And just for one more chance is somthing I could do to make it good Baby i would

I went to see her dad for a sit down man to man
It wasn't any secret, I'd be asking for her hand
I guess that's why he left me waiting
In the living room by myself
With at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf
She was


Playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him
In her eyes I'm prince charming
But to him I'm just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella


I leaned in towards those pictures
To get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say
"Now, ain't she somethin son?"
I said "Yeah, she's quite a woman"
And he just stared at me
And I realized that in his eyes she would always be


Playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him
In her eyes I'm prince charming
But to him I'm just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella


Oh, he slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him
That's when I could see it too


She was playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him
If he gives me a hard time
I can't blame the fellow
I'm the one who's stealing -- cinderella


If your mind's as cluttered as your kitchen sink
If your heart's as empty as your diesel tank
If all your white t-shirts have stains
If you've got some goods and got some ink
Well then, we should be friends


If you borrow dresses like you borrow time
If you dream all day and drink all night
If you're looking for love but willing to fight
Over men and momma's and Miller Lites
Well then, we should be friends


I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I read the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains


If you paint your nails while you cut your loss
If you like acting like you're the boss
If everything your daddy says
Is something you can put stock in
Well then, we should be friends


I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I wrote the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

One, two, three..


If you use alcohol as a sedative
And bless your heart as a negative
If you ride your white horse like the wind
If what you see is what you get
Well then, oh, we should be friends
(Alright)


Well then, oh, we should be friends
Well then, oh, we can be friends

You look so peaceful sleeping
You don't know that I'm leaving but I'm gone
Well I did my best to beat 'em, but in my head the demons said move on
When you wake up you're gonna curse my name
But as some time goes by I hope and pray

When you think of me
Remember the way that I used to be
Remember the times I held you tenderly
Remember the way that I love you

I think about the night I met you
I swore I'd never forget you, well I won't
I think about the way you live and breathe beside my dreams forever
Well you'll be better when I'm gone
Cuz I know you're gonna fall in love again
I'm sorry this is how it has to end

When you think of me
Remember the way that I used to be
Remember the times I held you tenderly
Remember the way I love you
When you think of me

As I pick up these bags and turn around
I say a little prayer and hope somehow

When you think of me
Remember the way that I used to be
Remember the times I held you tenderly
Remember the way that I love you

When you think of me
Remember the way that i used to be
Remember the times i held you tenderly
Remember the way that I love you

When you think of me
When you think of me
When you think of me
When you think of me


Well the weather man says it's going to be a hot one, heard it on the radio
Load up the boat, grab your girl if you got one, nice little breeze going to blow
Baby I'm on my way to come and get you, meet me at the end of your drive
Grab your shades and your string bikini and your Coppertone 45


Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good times, girl let me look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet, honey let your hair down too
I know a spot down on the river, underneath the Sycamore tree
Save all your kisses, but bring on your sweet love, pour it all over me
All over me


We can build us a fire when we run out of daylight, let it light up your face
Lay on a blanket, listen to the river, get a little carried away
Well I can take a side kiss on your sweet lips, ain't going to want it to end
So when the morning comes, we'll roll on out, and do it all over again




Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on


Pour it all over me
All over me


I've got dreams and aspirations
And I'm pretty good at conversations
I've got a heart I want to give
But I need someone to share it with
I love music and don't mind dancing
I'm easygoing, a little bit old-fashioned
I'm a sucker for sunsets, but the trouble is
I need someone to share it with


We're living all alone together
Like we don't even know each other anymore
I miss my friend, I miss my lover
We can rediscover everything that made us fall in love before


If you've got time you don't mind spending
I've got a world that feels like it's ending
Cause Baby, you're my life, but I can't live like this
I need someone to share it with




I miss my friend, I miss my lover
We can rediscover everything
That made us fall in love before
Because I've got dreams and aspirations
And I'm pretty good at conversations
And I've got a heart I want to give
I just need someone to share it with




Just a girl born in Dixie
Washed in the blood
And raised on the banks
Of the Mississippi mud
She always had a thing
About falling in love with a bad boy

Yea, they could see it all coming
But her daddy never dreamed
She'd grow up that fast
You know what I mean
The way a girl gets
When she turns 17
Kind of crazy


She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her


She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her


She kissed her mama goodbye
Said I'll be sure 'n phone you
She called from a truck stop
In Tucson Arizona
With amazing grace
We made California line
And then my gypsy life
Started taking its toll
And the fast lane got empty
And out of control
And just like an angel
She saved my soul from the devil


She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her


She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her


Now she holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her
God love her
Me and God love her


Well it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were 'do not disturb'
Checkout was s'posed to be noon but we slept in 'til three


She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key


Well I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no


She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah


We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but


She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Yeah
She kept it


She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key



Yeah she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Ooh
She kept the hotel key

Why is that sad look in your eyes? Why are you crying?
Tell me now, tell me now, tell me why you're feeling this way?
I hate to see you so down

Makin' you cry, makin' you feel blue?
Is there anything I can do?

And I'll do my best to make it better
I'll do my best to make the tears all go away

Just tell me where it hurts, now tell me
And I'll love you with a love so tender
And if you let me stay, I'll love all of the hurt away

Where are all those tears coming from? Why are they fallin'?
Did somebody somebody somebody leave your heart in the cold?
You just need somebody to hold

So baby, give me a chance to put back all the pieces
Take your broken heart, make it just like new
There's so many things I can do

Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby
And I'll do my best to make it better
I'll do my best to make the tears all go away

And I'll love you with a love so tender
Let me stay, I'll take all your hurt away
Tell me where it hurts now, baby

Oooh, yeah, yeah

I've been known to walk away
From love before
When it got serious I took off
Runnin' for the door

Made a point not to get hurt anymore
But there's no way I'm out
'cause I've nowhere to be
Now that love is here
Know that I won't break

'Cause I ain't scared to fall in love
Take my heart I'm not afraid
To give it up, to you, to you

Ain't no fear I can't fight
I'm ok girl when I look in your eyes
I like what I see in them
And I ain't scared

I ain't holding nothing back
I know its right
There's no monster in my head
Making me think twice

All our phobias are fallen, were just lies
You make me crazy baby, all shook up inside
The more you get to me, the more I'm terrified

But I ain't scared to fall in love
Take my heart I'm not afraid
To give it up, to you, to you

Ain't no fear I can't fight
I'm ok girl when I look in your eyes
I like what I see in them
Baby I ain't scared, no

I'll show you what I'm made of baby
I can take it there
I ain't holdin' nothing back
I know its right so

Baby I ain't scared
To fall in love
Take my heart
I'm not afraid
To give it up, to you, to you

Ain't no fear I can't fight
I'm ok girl when I look in your eyes
I like what I see in them
And I ain't scared

I ain't scared to fall in love
I ain't scared to give it up to you

Oh, o-oh-oh oh

I ain't scared to fall in love
I ain't scared to give it up to you

I didn't know you were gonna be at that bar when I walked in
'Til I walked in
I looked up, saw your face, turned around
And I walked back out again
Then I thought there's too much that we shared
So I made myself get ahold of myself
And walked back in
And went right up to you
I could feel you were caught off gaurd
Neither one of us knew just what to do
So I said
How's it been, been a while
Tell me how's your Mama
You said "good, you can sit down if you wanna"
I said I was just thinkin 'bout Oklahoma
The wild roller coaster ride we had that summer
Before we knew it we were on our 2nd glass of wine
Sittin there talkin' just like
We had never said goodbye

Well even after all that time well it clicked just like before
Maybe a little more
Before we knew it they were closing up the joint
Yea, stackin them chairs
Lockin them doors
I asked the waitress would she mind if we slept there
And stayed for breakfast
We both laughed
You grabbed your purse
I paid our tab
Standing underneath the moon
I couldn't help but ask
What you say we take a stroll down by the river
What a night, girl can you believe this weather
I been thinking we were pretty damn good together
You said yea wonder why did we ever let it go
I said I don't know but after seeing you tonight
Well it feels just like
We had never said goodbye
Never said goodbye

I been thinking maybe we should give it one more try
Like we never said good bye


Sitting on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You Waiting on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waiting on a woman


When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waiting on a woman


He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waiting on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waiting on a woman


And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just cause she can do it
Boy it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it
She'll take her time because you don't mind
Waiting on a woman


I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any
I hope she takes her time, cause I don't mind
Waiting on a woman


Honey, take your time, cause I don't mind
Waiting on a woman

I heard you slippin down the hall
Tell me did your shadow trip and fall
Over you babe
Movin that slowly

Did you think you could waste my time
Come messin 'round with my mind
Did you think you could?
Well you don't know me

Where'd you get that alibi?
Did it fall out of the midnight sky
Or did you find it
On the side of the road?

And tell me
Did you have to make a deal?
Or wrestle for control of the wheel
From your conscience, I'd like to know
Where do you go?
On your way home

You know some day I'd like to fly
Like a bat out of Nashville
Why don't you help me?
And tell me the truth?

'Cuz the truth is gonna set you free
If you keep on lyin to me
I might stay right here
Just to spite you

Where'd you get that alibi?
Did it fall out of the midnight sky
Or did you find it
On the side of the road?

And tell me
Did you have to make a deal?
Or wrestle for control of the wheel
From your conscience, I'd like to know
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
On your way home
On your way home

Where'd you get that alibi?
Did it drop out of the midnight sky
Or did you find it
Lyin' on the side of the road?

Was it ever a long long drive?
Did you ever stop once to cry?
Was I worth it?
I think I know
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
On your way home
On your way home

This was bound to happen
It was just a matter of time
This town is just too small for
Us to really say goodbye
You're smiling that smile that
You get when you're nervous
Like you don't quite know what to do
But this is me you're talking to
This is me you're talking to

I've heard you met somebody
It didn't take you very long
And I'll admit it isn't easy
Knowing you've moved on
But I can see how you could make any woman
Fall deep in love with you
This is me you're talking to

Me, the one who really knows you
Me, the one whose heart you've broken
Me, the one who was still hopin'
You might be missing me

We don't have to do this
We don't have to act like friends
As much as I would love to
I really just don't think I can
You don't have to tell me that you really love me
After all we have been through
'Cause this is me you're talking to

Me, the one who really knows you
Me, the one whose heart you've broken
Me, the one who was still hopin'
You might be missing me

Oh, and you don't have to say that you do
This is me you're talking to
This is me you're talking to


I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Everytime I see you, I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes


I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven


When we touch, when we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes


I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven


When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away


I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
Oh, yes I do
I wanna be inside your heaven


Well we grew up down by the railroad tracks
Shootin' BBs at old beer cans
Chokin' on the smoke from a Lucky Strike
Somebody lifted off of his old man
We were football flunkies
Southern rock junkies
Crankin' up the stereos
Singin' loud and proud to "Gimme Three Steps,"
"Simple Man," and "Curtis Loew"
We were good you know


Got some discount knowledge at the junior college
Where we majored in beer and girls
It was all real funny 'til we ran out of money
And they threw us out into the world
Yeah the kids that thought they'd run this town
Ain't runnin' much of anything
Just lovin' and laughin'
And bustin' our asses
And we call it all livin' the dream


And these are my people
This is where I come from
We're givin' this life everything we've got and then some
It ain't always pretty
But it's real
It's the way we were made
Wouldn't have it any other way
These are my people


Well we take it all week on the chin with a grin
Till we make it to a Friday night
And it's church league softball, holler 'bout a bad call
Preacher breakin' up the fight
Then later on at the Green Light Tavern
Well everybody's gatherin' as friends
And the beers are pourin' till Monday mornin'
And we start it all over again




We fall down, and we get up
We walk proud, and we talk tough
We got heart, and we got nerve
Even if we are a bit disturbed




You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine, always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind


Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind


Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flying
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference with sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
"I love you" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind


Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind


When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin'
Don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind


Alabama on the boombox, baby

Big stars breaking out through the indigo

Tail lights disappear in 'bout a mile or so
Down a county road

Baby sayin baby, let's do this
Rocket in a bottle with a fuse lit
Bout to lift it off, I'm bout to twist it off


Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin up a faded out 4x4

Sometimes my nails match my lips
And my jeans hug my hips
But I don't feel like doing all that right now
He's on his way over
And my hair's in a ponytail holder
And my true colors are coming out

CHORUS:
He better love me when my roots are showing
Or I'll pack up my boots and be going bye-bye-bye-bye-bye
If it's me that he's impressed with
Anything I might be dressed in
Ought to be just fine
If he's the one for me I'll know it
He better love me when my roots are showing

If overalls turn him off
If he don't like the way I talk
Well, that's alright with me
I am a product of
My momma, daddy, and the place I love
What he gets is what he sees


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed


And now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl


Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it, he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, "Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?"
And Daddy said, "You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye"


But now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American


And when they got married
And decided to have one of their own
She said, "Be honest, tell me what you want"
And he said, "Honey, you oughta know
Sweet little, beautiful, one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American"


Now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl


All-American girl

I don't wanna hurt nobody
Don't wanna make nobody cry
I don't wanna do wrong
I don't wanna do wrong
I don't wanna tell no lies
I'm lovin' you, lovin' you against my will
Lovin' you, lovin' you against my will

I don't wanna hear the phone ring
Don't wanna hear your voice on the line
I don't wanna come to you
I don't wanna come to you
I don't wanna give in this time
Girl I'm loving you, lovin' you against my will

Your love is like a deep dark river
Pullin' me out to sea
The harder I try to resist you
The weaker I seem to be

I don't wanna turn down your side street
I don't wanna pull in your drive
Don't wanna see you standin' there
Don't wanna see you standin' there
Don't wanna see that look in your eyes
Girl I'm loving you, lovin' you against my will

Your love is like a deep dark river
Pullin' me out to sea
The harder I try to resist you
The weaker I seem to be

I don't wanna feel your heartbeat
I don't wanna taste your kiss
I don't wanna call your name
I don't wanna call your name
I don't wanna want you like this
Girl I'm lovin' you, lovin' you against my will
Lovin' you, lovin' you against my will


You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mamma, pushed daddy around
Before you took off in his car
Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snowed, but you can't fool me
We both know who you are


Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy


I was haulin' this hay, to Uncle Joe's farm
I thought of us bare foot kids in the yard
Man it seems we were just catchin' snakes in the barn
Now you're caught up in this mess
I can use a little help unloadin' these bales
I can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail
Ain't a glamorous life, but it'll keep you outta jail
And not worry us all to death


Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy
Come on home, boy


Homeboy... Yeah...
You can't hold back the hands of time
Mamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind
I wish you'd come on back and make it all right
Before they're called...home, boy


Homeboy
Come on home, boy
Homeboy
Come on home, boy


I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd
Oh, but I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself


And tonight, I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh woah, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat


I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder, baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?


And tonight, I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat


I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest


And tonight, I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

If I had big arms like Aaron Tippin
I could have all the country girls flippin'
Tight jeans like Neil McCoy
I'd have all the ladies sayin' 'come here boy'
An Elvis quiver in my voice
From all the women I could have my choice
John Michael Montgomery charm
I'd have cuttin' wood honeys hangin' on my arms
Yeah I'd be on top of the world
I'd have all the pretty girls
And I'd be in on all the action
If I had long legs like Alan Jackson
If I had George Strait's famous smile
I'd have the women just a goin' hog wild
Eyes just like Tracy Byrd
I'd give 'em love lessons like they deserve
Jump around like Brooks 'n Dunn
Little Miss Honky Tonk would be number one
If I could growl like ol' Conway
Sayin' 'Hello Darlin' when they come my way
Yeah I'd be on top of the world
I'd have all the pretty girls
And I'd be in on all the action
If I had long legs like Alan Jackson
If I had Billy Ray's way of shakin'
I'd have the ladies' hearts achy breakin'
Put the girls in a screamin fit
If I had hair like Travis Tritt
Leather pants like Dwight Yokam
I'd have 'em all on the dancefloor smokin'
Wore a hat just like Garth Brooks
I'd be the one gettin' all the looks
Yeah I'd be on top of the world
I'd have all the pretty girls
And I'd be in on all the action
If I had long legs like Alan Jackson
I'm sure all the girls agree
That I could use some of these things
I'd be in on all the action
If I had long legs like Alan Jackson
I'd be the main attraction
If I had long legs
Like Alan Jackson


I can love you in the morning
I can love you all day
I can love you even more when I get home
I can love you every second
To the ends of the earth
Where needing you's the only thing that's on
My broken one track mind


Girl, I love you crazy
It comes so easy, after all we had
I could love you with all my heart
But the hardest part is
I just can't love you back


I could write a thousand letters
Call a hundred times a day
Or try to drown my sorrow at the bar
I could go down to the church
Get on my knees and pray
But it still won't change the way things really are
Won't bring you back again




I can love you for all I'm worth
To the ends of the earth
But I just can't love you back


She was circling the Holiday Inn
Just about to go around again
When her cell phone rang and it was him saying, "Room 183"
They've never done this before, but when he met her at the door
They broke out smiling because they were sure that this is what they need
She said, "Mama's got the kids"
And he said, "We got the room for the weekend"


They love their kids and their house and that dog in the yard
Oh, and their neighbors for the most part
They love each other, but it's hard to be lover's
When life gets in the way
Sometimes love needs a holiday


He hung up the "DO NOT DISTURB"
To shut out the rest of the world
48 hours of just him and her
You can't get this at home

She pulled the covers back and
He said, "Yeah I'm in to that"
They flopped down together and took a nap
No you can't get this at home
They woke up in each other's arms
And that's where they spent the rest of the weekend




Room service dinner with candles and wine
A night with no homework and no baby crying
They hold each other like they used to do
He whispers, "Girl, I've missed you"




Needs a holiday
He hung up the DO NOT DISTURB
Love needs a holiday
(Love needs a holiday)
Just shut out the rest of the world
Love needs a holiday
(Love needs a holiday)

I got a street light green
I got an old mustang
I got a small town get out anywhere but here dreams
And an open road
What am I waiting for
Well I'm five years in to a two year plan
Still standing here with the walls closing in
Behind this open door
What am I waiting for
Oh oh what am I waiting for
I stayed here for love watched it disappear
Now there's nothin but yesterdays holding me here
I can't take no more
What am I waiting for
Oh oh what am I waiting for
Well these blue skies and sunshine and good times
Are mine for the taking
I'm always saying I'm crazy for staying
So what am I waiting for
Ooh
I can hear God now
From a silver cloud
I got plans for you child
What you worried about
You know life's too short
What are you waiting for
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Yeah these blue skies and sunshine and good times
Are mine for the taking
I'm always saying I'm crazy for staying
So what am I waiting for
Oh oh what are you waiting for

Jack was a wreckless rebel boy from Tennessee
In and out of trouble with the law
Still something in his eyes looked like where she wanted to be
And he had never seen
Something so beautiful
Jenny's daddy wore a sheriff's badge
And one night Jack asked him for her hand
He said "Get real son, she's got bigger plans"
And you're crazy boy
If you think you're that man
Jack said

(Chorus)
Jenny will you run
Jenny will you run away with me
Hold me girl let's get away
And chase that open road
Follow what you feel
Remember what is real
It's you and me
No one can take this love away
Please tell me that you'll go
Jenny will you run
Whoa
She wrote a note, then tiptoed across the floor
They were headed straight for Vegas lights
Oh but daddy's just don't sleep through slowly creaking doors
And he yelled out "Don't you dare back out that drive"
Jack said

(Repeat Chorus)
Rearview blue and red
Jenny's heart was pounding
Highway up ahead
Oh oh she loves him
If you've got any doubts baby I'll pull over now
But I'm ready to slam this pedal through the ground
Come on

(Repeat Chorus)
Ah Jenny will you run
Whoa

There's brunettes, blonde girls
Blue jeans, string of pearls
Take you on a trip around the world girls
Love has a 1,000 faces
Love has a 1,000 faces

There's debutantes, drama queens
Glued to Bride magazine
Half caff, two pump, no whip in the Coffee Bean
Love has a 1,000 faces
Love has a 1,000 faces
But I see you
Before I ever knew you
Before I ever knew you
I dreamed of you
I dreamed of you

There's small town, itty-bitty
Tomboy in a big city
Turn your head when the light ain't red
Stop traffic, kind of pretty
Love has a 1,000 faces
Love has a 1,000 faces
But I see you

Before I ever knew you
Before I ever knew you
I dreamed of you
I dreamed of you, yeah

You're a storm at night, thunder crashing
Mystery, full of passion
Quiet as a Sunday morning
Change without any warning
Love has a 1,000 faces
Love has a 1,000 faces
But I see you
I see you
I see you
Baby, I see you
And I see you
Before I ever knew you
Before I ever knew you
Before I ever knew you
Before I ever knew you
I see you


You say your every day
Is a bad dream that keeps repeatin'
Maybe you should've thought about that
When you were cheatin'
How do you like that furnished room, the bed, the chair, the table
The TV picture comes and goes, too bad you don't have cable
How do you like that paper plate
And those pork-n-beans you're eatin'


Maybe you should've thought about that
When you were cheatin'


How do you like that beat up car, I think it's fair we traded
Your pick up truck is running fine, it's a cozy ride for datin'
Yes, I've been out a time or two, and found the comfort I've been needin




You made your bed and your out of mine
You lie awake and I sleep just fine
You've done your sowing, now you can do the reaping




Now what became of what's her name
After she spent all your money
Did she leave you just like you left me, well sometimes life is funny
Yes I'll be glad to take you back, just as soon as I stop breathin


Maybe you should've thought about that
Oh, maybe you should've thought about that
Maybe you should've thought about that
When you were cheatin'


Today, he told her that he loved her
Put a ring around her finger
And promised her forever together
Today, she smiled for all the pictures
And he was right there with her
Making all the memories without me
And it hurts to say this out loud
Looks like she's really gone now


Today is the happiest day of her life
I should be happy for her today
So tell me why are these tears in my eyes?
I know I should be happy for her
But I've lost everything
I've lost everything I've ever wanted today


Today, I thought about the moment
I could have said I loved her
And promised her forever together
Today, today it really hit me
That she don't really miss me
She's found a new beginning
And I'm wishing I had one more chance
God knows it's too late for that


Today is the happiest day of her life
I should be happy for her today
So tell me why are these tears in my eyes?
I know I should be happy for her
But I've lost everything
I've lost everything I've ever wanted today


Today is the happiest day of her life
I should be happy for her
But I've lost everything
I've lost everything I've ever wanted


Today, he told her that he loved her
Put a ring around her finger

There's a photo in my baby book
Of the first step that I ever took
I ended up on my butt with a puzzled look
Ever since I've been kinda confused
When life tripped me up I was easily bruised
But time has a way of healing wounds
Now, I'm a guy who does what he feels
But I never seem to spot that banana peel
With eyes shut tight and nerves of steel
I'm takin' the plunge, baby head over heels

Fallin' never felt so good
It don't scare me like I thought it would
Tumblin' down, droppin' fast
I got a feelin' that it's gonna last
Here I come baby ooh, ooh, ooh
Fallin' in love with you

Who can say what may lie in store
Smooth sailin' on a sea of love or
Runnin' aground on a rocky shore
Now that I've found you I'm not lettin' go
'Cause I've been searchin' high and low
Only one thing that I know
The higher you take me the deeper I go

Fallin' never felt so good
It don't scare me like I thought it would
Tumblin' down, droppin' fast
I got a feelin' that it's gonna last
Here I come baby ooh, ooh, ooh
Fallin' in love with you

Fallin' never felt so good
It don't scare me like I thought it would
Tumblin' down, droppin' fast
I got a feelin' that it's gonna last
Here I come baby ooh, ooh, ooh
Fallin' in love with you

Fallin' never felt so good
It don't scare me like I thought it would
Tumblin' down, droppin' fast
I got a feelin' that it's gonna last
Here I come baby ooh, ooh, ooh
Fallin' in love with you...

Another year has come and gone
And I'm still here
Holdin' on
To this riffle and
A picture of my kids
Sayin' it's a holiday
Sure as hell don't feel that way
Don't think Jesus meant for it to feel like this


A paper star on a plastic tree
Cotton Snow in a manger scene
Do the best we can to make it feel like home
Turkey Dinner on paper plates
Sargent bows his head to pray
BoomBox playin' Silent Night
Camouflage and Christmas Lights

They're probably up on the hill by now
Bundled up, and sleddin' down
Catchin' snowflakes on the edge of their tounges
Standin' up at the top would be
The prettiest girl I've ever seen
Whispering a quiet prayer for all of us

A paper star on a plastic tree
Cotton Snow in a manger scene
Do the best we can to make it feel like home
Turkey Dinner on paper plates
Sargent bows his head to pray
BoomBox playin' Silent Night
Camouflage and Christmas Lights

Some say I'm a hero
But I'm just a dad
Just tryin' to protect the most precious thing I have
Someday I'll be home again
And our world will be right
But for tonight

A paper star on a plastic tree
Cotton Snow in a manger scene
Do the best we can to make it feel like home
Turkey Dinner on paper plates
Sargent bows his head to pray
BoomBox playin' Silent Night
Camouflage and Christmas Lights

Thank God it's a silent night
Camouflage and Christmas Lights:)

I've been working as a temp
At the local factory
I hope they hire me on full time
I've got shoes to buy
And a mouth to feed

I drive a buy here, pay here truck
It ain't new, but it is for me
It ain't much but it fires right up
And get me from A to B

What puts the dirt underneath my nails
What keeps the calluses on my hands
Family man

They're a world my world revolves around
My sacred piece of solid ground
The flesh and bone that gives me strength to stand
They are a fire in my drivin on
The drive behind my comin home
The livin, breathin, reason that I am
A family man

There's dirty shirts to wash
Dishes in the sink to do
And there's how many times
Does 17 go into 52

There's bedtime prayers to pray
Sleep tights and I love you's
And then there's a pair of eyes
I get to lose myself into

What keeps me keepin the faith
What makes me believe I can
Family man

They're a world my world revolves around
My sacred piece of solid ground
The flesh and bone that gives me strength to stand
They are a fire in my drivin on
The drive behind my comin home
The livin, breathin, reason that I am
A family man

There's a fire in my drivin on
The drive behind my comin home
The livin, breathin, reason that I am
A family man

A family man


We were sitting up there on your momma's roof
Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move


Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me


Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?


It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand


So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me


Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?



So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon

And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle



When the preacher man said, "Say I do"
I did and you did too

Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?


Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?



Yeah baby I love you a lot

I really think we've got a shot

Are you gonna kiss me or not?

So you're tired and you're beat and you worked all week
And you need a place where you can let it go
Where the girls go wild and the boys play hard
And you need a little more than just the radio

Well, here's your open invitation
With ust a couple regulations
And warn you, son, only come to have
We don't take kindly to serious

So leave your troubles at the door
Unless you want some in here

Welcome to my house, buckle up tight
Everybody sings and drinks and laughs and gets high
It's the country music, a little soul
It's a rock and roll rodeo

We don't tolerate no sittin' around
Everybody's dancin', groovin', and gettin' on down
So before you come in here with some kind of attitude
Better read the house rules

Around 11 o'clock when the front door locks
And the boys start raisin' the bottle
Where the girls do the thing with the Mardi Gras beads
You know they're gonna show 'em if they got 'em

And no matter what your story
A good time is mandatory

Well, rule number seven says don't touch the women
But they can grab whatever they want to

Welcome to my house, buckle up tight
Everybody sings and drinks and laughs and gets high
It's the country music, a little soul
It's a rock and roll rodeo

We don't tolerate no sittin' around
Everybody's dancin', groovin', and gettin' on down
So before you come in here with some kind of attitude
You better read the house rules

There's no such thing as last call
We'll pick 'em up when they fall
We share the same bathroom stall
Says the sign on the wall

One, two, three

Welcome to my house, buckle up tight
Everybody sings and drinks and laughs and gets high
It's the country music, a little soul
It's a rock and roll rodeo

We don't tolerate no sittin' around
Everybody's dancin', groovin', and gettin' on down
So before you come in here with some kind of attitude
Boy, before you come walkin' in here with any kind of attitude

Lord, you better read the house rules
Oh, soh, you better read the house rules
Two, three, Jay
You better read the house rules

Excuse me, excuse me
I'm gon' need to see some I.D. on that girl right there


The scent that you left on my pillow
The sound of your heartbeat with mine
The look in your eyes like a window
The taste of your kiss soaked in wine


Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing


Guess you forgot what you told me
Because you left my heart on the floor
Baby, your ghost still haunts me
But I don't want to sleep with him no more


Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing


They say time is the only healer
God, I hope that isn't right
Cause right now I'd die to not remember


Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
I'm haunted by the memories of
Every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing

The word is faithful, look it up
It don't mean sneakin' around
Behind my back like you ain't gettin' enough
How 'bout forever, just look it up
It means through thick and thin and
Pitchin' in even when the times get tough

The word is easy, look it up
And you'll see a picture of that piece of trash
Ridin' 'round in your pickup truck
Let's try liar, just look it up
But you'll need boots to wade through all the bull
You tell me when you come home drunk
It's just like you to be so clueless
Cause you never thought I'd do this

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up

You said you're sober, look it up

It's right next to hell is freezin' over, flyin' pigs
And all that stuff
And how bout baby, look it up
It's what you call me and it's how you act
Every time I call your bluff
It's just like you to keep denyin'
Save your whinin' and your cryin'

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up

The word's forgiveness, look it up
It's what Jesus has in store for you
But I don't no matter what
Quit your beggin' and your prayin'
Can't you hear what I've been sayin'?

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up

Asshole

Just look it up, look it up

I remember the summer I turned 16
And that old Jalapie daddy gave to me
It had holes in the floor and just a 305
But I didn't care cause I could finally drive
There wasn't much to do in my hometown
So every weekend night we would all go down

Yeah there were freaks and hippies in my high school
Football players all trying to be cool
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer when the cops drove by, till the coast was clear
Kids falling in a out of love on the hoods of Chevys, in the beds of trucks
We were stumbling our way through life till our senior year
But man we sure did learn a lot in that Wal mart parking lot

She had long blonde hair and sea green eyes
The most beautiful thang I'd ever seen in my life
But I was young and dumb and didn't have a line
And all I could say was can I call you sometime
She just said no and walked away
And that was the first time I felt my heart break

Yeah there were freaks and hippies in my high school
Football players trying to be cool
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer when the cops drove by till the coast was clear
Kids falling in and out of love on the hoods of chevys, in the beds of trucks
We were stumbling our way through life till our senior year
But man we sure did learn a lot in that wal mart parking lot

Yea, we did a lot of livin'
It was small town teenage Heaven

Yeah there were freakes and hippies in my high school
We were all just tryin to be cool
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beers when the cops drove by till the coast was clear
Kids fallin in and out of love on the hoods of chevys, in the beds of trucks
We were stumblin our way through life till our senior year
But man we sure did learn a lot in that wal mart parking lot
In that Wal-mart parking lot
I had my first kiss, my first love, got my ass kicked but I got back up
Lost my way, found it again had one long buzz and a dozen best friends
Oohhh, oohhh
In that wal mart parking lot

It's the little things that mean the most to me
Like wakin' up with you this close to me
Watch the sunrise
There in your eyes
Sleepy smile
Tangled hair
Mornin' love
Girl I swear

This is the life
The one we're livin'
These are the days
We've been given
This is the love
Now and forever
And we only get one chance to live it right
This is the life

Life is funny let's just laugh at it
Who knows what's comin' after it
Our days are numbered
Filled with wonder
Let's raise our glass
To the years
Make love last
While we're here

Oh, this is the life
The one we're livin'
These are the days
We've been given
This is the love
Now and forever
And we only get one chance to live it right
Oh, this is the life
This is the life

This is the life
The one we're livin'
These are the days
We've been given
This is the love
Now and forever
And we only get one chance to live it right
Yeah, we only get one chance but that's all right
‘Cause this is the life
This is the life

Don't want to read the paper
Or turn on the news
Don't want another helping of the same old blues
Don't want to call nobody
Or answer the phone
What I want is everybody to leave us alone

(chorus)
Let us sit down in the porch swing
Sip a little ice tea
Play with the kids in the yard
Hey it's time to get lazy
Had enough crazy
Life ain't got to be so hard
Oh, life don't have to be so hard

No it don't

Want to stop and smell the roses
I don't want to run
Want to catch up on the talkin that we hadn't done
The only big decision that I want to make
Is do we take this conversation down to the lake

(chorus)
Or do we sit down in the porch swing
Sip a little ice tea
Play with the kids in the yard
Hey it's time to get lazy
Had enough crazy
Life ain't got to be so hard
Oh, life don't have to be so hard

More time with you less time for worry
More slowing down less in a hurry

(chorus)
So we can sit down in the porch swing
Sip a little ice tea
Play with the kids in the yard
Hey its time to get lazy
Had enough crazy
Life ain't got to be so hard
Oh, life don't have to be so hard

No it don't baby


There's a barstool downtown with my name on it
There's a party crowd promising a good time
But I ain't goin'
Used to be, I'd be there
Throwin' a couple down
But now one leads to two, and two leads to four
And before I know it, I'm thinking about


Standing at the end of the drive
Your tail lights fading into the night
Screaming your name in the pouring down rain
Watching you leave us behind
So I don't go out on the town
All the whiskey I had, I poured out
My heart needs time to get over you and me
And that's where I go when I drink


Sometimes I feel like I could have a few
But I know better your memory's no quitter
And every time I do, I'm...


Standing at the end of the drive
Your tail lights fading into the night
Screaming your name in the pouring down rain
Watching you leave us behind
So I don't go out on the town
All the whiskey I had, I poured out
My heart needs time to get over you and me
And that's where I go when I drink


One drop, you flood my mind
Like a river of goodbye
And I'm..


Standing at the end of the drive
Your tail lights fading into the night
Screaming your name in pouring down rain
Watching you leave us behind
So I don't go out on the town
All the whiskey I had, I poured out
My heart needs time to get over you and me
And that's where I go when I drink


When I drink
That's where I go when I drink


Your lips, your eyes, don't wanna let go
Your skin on mine, I'm losing control
Hear the rumble in your chest
Feel the wind comin' off your breath
Your curves ain't slowin' me down
Ain't nothin' gonna stop us now


You're fire, I'm lightnin'
We're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin'
Girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come alive
It's insane, baby
We're like thunder in the rain


Twisted, tangled like a hurricane
We shake these walls like an earthquake
Hear the rumble in your chest
Feel the wind comin' off your breath
The way you're callin' out my name
Makes me hard to contain


You're fire, I'm lightnin'
We're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin'
Girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come alive
It's insane, baby
We're like thunder in the rain
We're like thunder in the rain


You're fire, I'm lightnin'
We're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin'
Girl, we're a perfect storm


You're fire, I'm lightnin'
We're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin'
Girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come alive
It's insane, baby
We're like thunder in the rain
We're like thunder in the rain

I remember when it all began
You couldn't keep your body
From my hands
I remember nights we felt
So close
How we got so distant
I don't know
So as you plan
Your brand new life
Keep this one thing in mind

If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again
The door's wide open
Baby walk right in
I'll be waitin'
'Til the end of time
Heart and mind
Now just like back then
If you ever feel
Like needin' someone
Who will love you
Like I've always done
Girl I'll show you
Some things never end
If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again

People change
And baby so do dreams
They move along
To where the grass is green
So I won't hold you down
To what we had
Last thing I wanna do
Is make you sad
But if things don't fly your way
Girl it's never too late

If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again
The door's wide open
Baby walk right in
I'll be waitin'
'Til the end of time
Heart and mind
Now just like back then
If you ever feel
Like needin' someone
Who will live you
Like I've always done
Girl I'll show you
Some things never end
If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again

How he got that GI Joe in the church this morning
I don't know but he ain't listening to the preacher
Like his mama taught him to
She's wanting me to cross the aisle
Go, sit over there with him awhile
Make him turn around and sit up straight
Stop playing in the pew
To watch him is all that I can do

Cause I look at him and I see a boy
And I see trouble and I see joy
See innocence and headstrong
And a heart full of dreams

I look at him and I'm so amazed
I'm so proud and then sooo afraid
That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree
Yeah I look at him and I see me

Already says when he grows up
He's gonna have a big ole truck
And I can see him getting stuck
On some private property

He'll take chances, he'll take dare's
And keep his mama and me scared to death
When he goes out at night
You know I'll bet we'll never sleep
I guess I get what my dad got from me

Cause' I look at him and I see a teen
Having fun doing stupid things
I see roadblocks I see mistakes
I see heartbreak he can't see

I look at him and I'm so amazed
I'm so proud and then sooo afraid
That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree
Ohhh I look at him and I see me

I look at him and I see me
Breaking down one day
As he packs up all his things
To move awayyyyy

I look at him and I'm so amazed
I'm so proud and then sooo afraid
That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree
Yeah I look at him and I see me


Just what I had in mind thinking about the weekend
Standing by the Yeti with the party lights plugged in
Got a jug of feel good, going around
There's just one thing missing, baby, right about now


I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you


I see you dancing over there with your girlfriends
Got your fine self showing off that sun tan
You keep smiling that smile at me
Like you're reading my mind, and you know


I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you


I need a sweet little somethin' like you, girl
Sliding into my world
Yeah, I've been needing it all night
Slow kinda just right
Honeysuckle sweet little somethin'


I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin'

Sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you

I wanna ride you round in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl, you got some serious
Sweet little somethin' like you

The way you slide that across the seat
Looking so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little somethin' like

I wanna ride you round in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl, you got some serious
Sweet little somethin' like you

The way you slide that across the seat
Looking so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little somethin' like you

I've got a number on a napkin, a poundin' in my head
Takes everything I've got to crawl out of bed
I lost a hell of a woman, freedom caught me on the chin
But I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in

The sun came up again this morning
I got a call from a long lost friend
Planned us a little road trip down to New Orleans
It ain't much but it beats where I've been

Yea I'm doin' alright
I'm doin' alright
I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in

Well I'm gettin' better at barely gettin' by
When I look at her picture I don't break down and cry
And all this time on my hands it's gettin' easier to spend
Cause I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in

The sun came up again this morning
I took my old fastback for a spin
Now when it rains it ain't always pouring
And I'm learning how to live again

Yea I'm doin' alright
I'm doin' alright
I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in

Yea I'm doin' alright
Yes I'm doin' alright
Yea I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in

Yes I'm doin' alright
Yea I'm doin' alright
Yea I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in


I have always been a little shy
I've always been the quiet type 'till now
I never let my feelings show
I never let anybody know
Just how much I was so deep in love
But now that you're in my arms


I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world
To know just what I'm all about
I love to love you out loud


You keep bringing out the free in me
What you do to my heart just makes me melt
And I don't think I can resist
But I've never been one to kiss and tell
A love this true can't be subdued
So I'm gonna let out a yell






Baby, I want the whole world to see
Just how good your love looks on me




Baby, I love to love you out loud
Yeah, I love to love you out loud


This might come as quite a shock
But I've given it a lot of thought
This thing that's come between us can't be ignored
I've taken all I can
And this is where it's gotta end
'Cause I can't be your friend anymore


And I can't be accused
Of not being there for you
How many nights have you shown up at my door?
I hope you understand
That this wasn't in my plans
But I can't be your friend anymore


And it's killing me to know you
Without having a chance to hold you
And all I wanna do is show you how I really feel inside
You can run to me, you can laugh at me or you can walk right out that door
But I can't be your friend anymore


So baby now it's up to you
Do I win or do I lose
Will my heart fly or lie broken on the floor
Well take me as I am
'Cause I wanna be your man
But I can't be your friend anymore


And it's killing me to know you
Without having a chance to hold you
Yeah all I wanna do is show you how I really feel inside
You can run to me, you can laugh at me or you can walk right out that door
But I can't be just friends anymore


We can't just be friends anymore


Old school McGraw coming out of my doors
Had to pull over, couldn't take it no more
Got this thing running in park, hazards lighting up the dark
I was just out driving around
Wasn't scanning for a memory to slow me down
But damn, if yours didn't baby
I'd'a paid that DJ not to play it


Cause I'm sitting here knowing what its gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar, it ain't the beer, it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear you say you miss me tonight
Yeah, anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on, said it is what it is
But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside
Baby, I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time


People slowing down, wanna see what's wrong
I got my hand out the window just waving 'em on
Cause I don't wanna have to explain
Don't want no one to see me this way
Don't need no gas, don't need no ride
Everything on this Chevy is running just right
I just need another minute or two
'Til this song's over like me and you


I'm sitting here knowing what its gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar, it ain't the beer, it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear you say you miss me tonight
Yeah, anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on, said it is what it is
But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside
Yeah, baby, I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time


Yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on, but I'm here like this
Off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside
Yeah, baby, I'm broke down, but it ain't the truck this time
No, it ain't the truck this time


I got nowhere go, nowhere to be
I'm nobody, baby, if you don't love me


Hey girl, what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing
But I sure do like your style
And I can see you came to rock
In your blue jeans and white tank top;
Man that look drives me wild


And it's hey now here we go
D-j don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more
Been here since the sun went down
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
Gonna get a little bit sideways...
Sideways


Ain't no need to fight
You all take that redneck stuff outside
That's what parking lots are for
Once you're out you ain't coming back
The man on the ropes ain't got no slack
Man they're busting down the door!




That's right
Hey now here we go
(hey now here we go)
D-j don't you play nothing slow
Got to make them want to (what?)
Got to make them want to (what?)
Got to make them want to come back for more


Hey now here we go
D-J don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more
Been here since the sun went down
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
Going to get a little bit sideways (na na na na na)
Sideways...sideways...sideways


Hey girl what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing


Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue


Crowded street, busy feet, hustle by him
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by


Should you stop? Better not, much too busy
You'd better hurry, my how time does fly
And in the distance the ringing of laughter
(Willie Nelson)
And in the midst of the laughter he cries


Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Oh, pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue



Grandma got runned over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe

She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog
And we'd begged her not to go
But she'd left her medication
So she stumbled out the door into the snow

When they found her Christmas mornin'
At the scene of the attack
There were hoof prints on her forehead
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back

Grandma got runned over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
(On her way home)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
(Say there's no Santa)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe)

Now we're all so proud of Grandpa
He's been takin' this so well
See him in there watchin' football
Drinkin beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle

It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder:
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?

Grandma got runned over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
(Midnight before Christmas)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
(Say there's no Santa)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe)

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And a blue and silver candle
That would have just matched the hair in grandma's wig

I've warned all my friends and neighbors
"Better watch out for yourselves
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves."

Grandma got runned over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
(Minding her own business)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
(What do you mean there's no Santa?)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe)
Sing it, Grandpa!

Oh

She got me, to stop drinking
And for that, I'm thankful
She almost pulled off, pulling me through
And she got me standing upright
Even had me coming home nights
But she never got me over you

She almost had me had me where you have me
She almost did what you still do
She got me thinking straight again
But I don't think she understands
She never got me over you

She almost had me had me where you have me
She almost did what you still do
She got me thinking straight again
But I don't think she understands
She never got me over you

On a plane to the West Coast, laptop on my tray
Papers spread across my seat, a big deadline to make
An older man sitting next to me said, "Sorry to intrude
Thirty years ago my busy friend, I was you
I made a ton of money and I climbed up the ladder
Yeah, I was superman, not what does it matter

I missed the first steps my daughter took
The time my son played Captain Hook in 'Peter Pan'
I was in New York, said 'Sorry son, Dad has to work'
I missed the father daughter dance
The first home run, no second chance
To be there when he crossed the plate
The moment's gone now it's too late
Fame and fortune come with a heavy price
Son, don't miss your life."

Funny you should say that, I was sitting at the gate
My daughter called, she made straight A's and they're off to celebrate
Scrolling through the pictures of my little family
My daughter with her mom and friends, not a single one with me
They know I love 'em, I know they know I care
The truth is half the time, I'm not even there

I missed our fourth and fifth anniversary
Our girl was early by a week
Her sister had to hold her hand
I was in L.A., she said "I understand"
I missed her first day of school
Then what kind of crazy fool
Lets such precious moments pass
We all know time goes way too fast
Hold on tight cause it don't happen twice
Don't miss your life

When I get off this plane, I'll buy a turn-around ticket
Saturday's her eighth birthday and I'm not gonna miss it

There'll be balloons and birthday cake
And I'll clean up the mess they make
My mom and dad are drivin' in
I haven't seen 'em in God knows when
My wife will probably say to me
"I thought you were supposed to be in Portland
For a few more days", I'll take her in my arms and say
"I heard some words that hit me hard last night
A man said: 'Don't miss your life'."


Hey girl, I’m just a small town run around
I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I’m more a fishin’ in the dark nitty gritty boy
So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is


Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night ‘til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that


When I’m with you I can see down the road girl
Not just the gravel one we’re travelin’ on girl
And I’m bettin’ that it’s gonna be a wild ride
But I promise that I’m gonna be there by your side
I think we got another memory in the makin’
So baby let’s take it, take it


Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night ‘til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that


I ain’t gonna do it like a pretty city boy
I’m a fishin’ in the dark nitty gritty boy
So let me love you


Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night ‘til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that


Baby, I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that


When the lights go down
He'll be filling a pan with a broom in his hand
In some dive across town
He'll be wiping the bar, and mopping the floor
Counting his tips, and locking the doors
Wrestling the Devil that tells him to pour another round
When the lights go down
She'll be calling her friends from her Mercedes Benz
But it's too late now
They were there for the fame, the flash, and the thrill
For the drop of the name, the parties, the pills
As another star falls from the Hollywood Hills without a sound


When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be
When the lights go down and truth is all you see
When you feel that hole inside your soul
And wonder what you're made of
Well we all find out
When the lights go down


When the lights go down
At the end of the day when this game that I play
Has gone another round
As I lay there alone on this big empty bed
With nothing but thoughts of you in my head
I think of the things that I wish I had said
When you were still around


When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be
When the lights go down and the truth is all you see
And I wonder if all my life's about the sum
Of all my fears and all my doubts
When the lights go down



Just a slow down small town
Just a deep south home crowd
With nothing to do and nothing to lose
The same old paper and same old news

We'd ride around 10:30 on a Friday
We'd hurry to a parkin lot
With all our friends
Turning up the heat when
We finally made it to the weekend

We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open

She was made for the fast lane
She was more than just a pretty face
First time lover, we spent that summer
Doing nothing but getting away

We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open

We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open

(Just a slow down small town)
Wide open
(Just a deep south home crowd)
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open
Wide open

Trans-Am, t-top's down
Red-light in my home town
Nothin' to do, just cruisin' around
With a couple of my best friends
So he pulls up in this blue Mustang
Finest thing we'd ever seen
All cowboy'd up in his hat 'n jeans
Only one thing to do when he pulled away

We went flyin' down the interstate
Chasin' those Texas plates
Seventeen, we couldn't wait
To see where the road might lead
Not a care in the whole wide world
Just three Oklahoma girls
Wantin' a piece of the Lone Star state
Chasin' those Texas plates

Blue letters read Cowboy fan
Texas flag on top of them
He looked like the kinda man
You can't take home to Mama
He went slow for a couple of miles
Flashin' lights an' tradin' smiles
Then he stepped on the gas an' he waved goodbye
An' we couldn't catch up but we had to try

We went flyin' down the interstate
Chasin' those Texas plates
Seventeen, we couldn't wait
To see where the road might lead
Not a care in the whole wide world
Just three Oklahoma girls
Wantin' a piece of the Lone Star state
Chasin' those Texas plates

Oh yeah
We were flyin'

An' I still love to remember
That Trans-Am and that summer
And just how good it felt.....

When we went flyin' down the interstate
Chasin' those Texas plates
Seventeen, couldn't wait
To see where the road might lead
Not a care in the whole wide world
Just three Oklahoma girls
Wantin' a piece of the Lone Star state
Chasin' those Texas plates

Oh yeah, chasin' those Texas plates


I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and
I'm gonna play some flip-cup and
Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger
And throw a 20 on the corn hole game
If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid
The way that it's going, the keg gon' be floating


All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on


Girl you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want you can pet on my Harley
I sit you up on a kitchen sink
Stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feeling we gone by this evening


All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on

Don’t need a hotel or a high-rise
A big ol’ boat with a fancy name
Don’t need a backseat
Don’t need no rusty truck bed
We can leave that dust on that ol’ porch swing


Let’s get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass
Lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field


Now we got that California king
In the back of that Georgia double-wide
And I’m ‘bout to bust out the seams
When I get you to the country side
What’s that sound like to you?
Cause it sounds dang good to me
Just hit me with a smile when you’re ready to leave


Let’s get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass
Lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field


Find an old pasture where the cows ain’t been for a while
Wanna see your blue eyes where the flowers grow wild
Little after midnight, morning dew on our skin
Promise you won’t nobody, nobody know where we’ve been


Let’s get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass
Lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field


Love me in a field
Love me in a field
In a big ol’ field

I was looking for a cheap car in the Sunday classifieds
When an ad jumped out
And hit me right between my bugged out eyes
It was a two-year-old Mercedes
For seven hundred bucks
I couldn't make my tremblin' fingers
Dial that number fast enough

The woman who picked up the phone
Said yes it's still for sale
But I had about a thousand calls
So you better move your tail

When I drove up that long driveway
With the cash there in my hands
She met me at the garage in a short skirt and a tan
When we took it for a test drive
I couldn't believe my luck
She said I'll throw in those Arnold golf clubs there in the trunk

None of this was makin' sense
But then it dawned on me
When she referred to her old man as that cheatin' S.O.B

It was a classic case of a woman scorned
She'll make that man wish he had never been born
She's a forty something year old judge and jury
He'll have no fury like revenge of a middle aged woman

So she took me out to breakfast
Put it on his credit card
And by the time they poured the coffee
She was pouring out her heart

Stories of his sneakin' round and sorted escapades
Secretaries, waitresses, and bimbos half his age
She said you know there's one thing I outta thank him for
Well, he ticked me off so much
I put new locks on the doors

Well, I believe good wine and women get better with time
And if you ask me that man's a fool
Or else he must be blind
I'll never know his motives
Can't get inside his head
But I'm drivin' that Mercedes
And I'm sleeping in his bed

Well, I believe good wine and women get better with time
And if you ask me that man's a fool
Or else he must be blind
I'll never know his motives
Can't get inside his head
But I'm drivin' that Mercedes
And I'm sleeping his bed

Revenge of a middle aged woman


I know I oughta feel guilty about something…
I just can't think of what it might be

I miss the look of surrender in your eyes
The way your soft brown hair would fall
I miss the power of your kiss when we made love
But baby most of all

I miss my friend
The one my heart and soul confided in
The one I felt the safest with
The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again
And let the light back in
I miss my friend

I miss the colors that you brought into my life
Your golden smile, those blue-green eyes
I miss your gentle voice in lonely times like now
Saying it'll be alright

I miss my friend
The one my heart and soul confided in
The one I felt the safest with
The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again
And let the light back in
I miss my friend

I miss those times
I miss those nights
I even miss the silly fights
The making up
The morning talks
And those late afternoon walks

I miss my friend
The one my heart and soul confided in
The one I felt the safest with

She picked up the telephone
All she heard was dial tone
She really thought she heard it ring this time
She said what am I thinking I must be only dreaming
Or maybe it's the hundred times he's crossed my mind
Just tonight

She said maybe I miss your loving
Maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit
Maybe I miss your body, lying right next to mine
Maybe I miss your touch, a little too much

Tossing and turning her skin's still burning
From the fire in his hands
Running on empty, she needs somebody
But somebody wouldn't understand
Then the telephone rings

She said maybe I miss your loving
Maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit
Maybe I miss your body, lying right next to mine
Maybe I miss your touch, a little too much

They talked about Savannah
Sweet home Alabama
And how he missed the way she always smiled
"Are you coming back soon"
"By the Harvest moon
If I have to walk every mile on my knees"

She said maybe I miss your loving
Maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit
Maybe I miss your body, lying right next to mine
Maybe I miss your touch, a little too much

She said maybe I miss your loving
Maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit
Maybe I miss your body, lying right next to mine
Maybe I miss your touch, a little too much


Kick the dust up, c'mon


All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac


We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)


Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people


We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (c'mon)


Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did (kick it)


We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That’s what’s up, up
Let’s kick the dust up


Darling, please, we were too gone to stay
Couldn't get through the night, so we had to call it a day
The words came out; they couldn't be erased
Saw the pain in your eyes, and I knew everything had changed


I'm a traitor, I'm the cause
I'm the breaker of your heart
I ain't saying what you want
But baby, please, know that if


Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once


It's been months; I'm still seeing signs of you
Things that you wanted me to read, shit that you wanted me to do
If I'm left in the deepest part of your mind, it's cool
Oh, it's cool


Yeah, it hurts, I agree
You're still the first part of me
I know I set you free
But baby, please, know that if


Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once


Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once
I know this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once


It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door


'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day


When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Two days you're taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a fool proof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me


'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day


Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day


There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait


'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day


Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day


Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day

It's the first time that I've been here
Since I was here with him
I remember all the wild flowers
Waving in the wind
Life was an undiscovered river
I was jumping in
Head first

It was sink or swim, do or die
Sneaking out on summer nights
Stealing wine from my Pa
The thrill of not getting caught
And now and then I miss those days
But coming back to this place
I realize it ain't him I miss
It's that young girl, wide-eyed, first love
One time innocence
Yeah

We ran off to the corn field
Just outside the county fair
There were butterflies in my stomach
And fireflies in the air
He tried hard not to show it
Oh, but he was just as scared
As me

And it was sink or swim, do or die
Sneaking out on summer nights
Stealing wine from my Pa
The thrill of not getting caught
And now and then I miss those days
But coming back to this place
I realize it ain't him I miss
It's that young girl, wide-eyed, first love
One time innocence
Yeah

And coming here has made me come to this
The one thing I can't get back
Is the one thing I miss
Yeah

And it was breaking rules, flying blind
What you see through younger eyes
It wasn't what I thought it was
Man, I swore he was the one
And now and then I miss those days
But coming back to this place
I realize it ain't him I miss
It's that young girl, wide-eyed, first love
One time innocence
Yeah
It's that young girl, wide-eyed, first love
One time innocence
Yeah, it's that innocence
Mmm, mmm

Love, love, love, love
It's not like I've ever been hurt
I can't count the times I've been wrong
I know how it feels to be broken
I haven't found the one that's perfect
But God knows I've been so close
And that's what keeps me hopin'
And I don't know how to hold back
I don't know how to slow down
I don't need doubts to come back
Bring me down
Say I'm just a fool
For always fallin', always fallin'
Say my heart won't last
If it keeps fallin', always fallin', yeah
If love's a drug I need it
Just like a rush, gotta feel it
Never want to stop believin'
As long as I'm alive
I'm dreamin' love, love, love
So I close my eyes and jump in
Before I measure the fall
I can't get enough of that feelin'
And I still want the fairytale endin'
I'll never settle for less
What good is livin' with regret
Say I'm just a fool
For always fallin', always fallin'
Say my heart won't last
If it keeps fallin', always fallin', yeah
If love's a drug I need it
Just like a rush gotta feel it
Never wanna stop believin'
As long as I'm alive
I'm dreamin' love
I don't know how to hold back
I don't know how to slow down
I don't need doubts to come back
Bring me, bring me down
Say I'm just a fool
For always fallin', always fallin'
Say my heart won't last
If it keeps fallin', always fallin', yeah
If love's a drug I need it
Just like a rush
Never wanna stop believin'
As long as I'm alive
I'm dreamin' love, love, love


I'm so sorry, I keep interrupting, what were you gonna say?
You caught him cheating, I don't blame you for walking away
I know where you're coming from, it sounds like where I've been
Oh, there I go interrupting your story once again


Go on, go on, you were saying how a fool can only fool you so long
It's true, it's so true when they do you like that
What else you can do but go on


Our conversation won't change nothing, but it's sure nice to talk
With somebody who's been cut out of the same ole' cloth
You know how you said happiness can't be found looking back
If you don't mind, maybe we can talk a little more about that





Even when you see no reason to
Don't wait to live life 'cause it won't wait for you




Just go on
Life goes on, and on

​
For a boy your heart is pretty see through
For a boy you sure let your guard down
When you know what you want
Want what you see and baby right now you’re looking at me
The way you say my name
I know you ain’t playing games


For a boy you’re good at saying sorry
For a boy I sure can feel your heart
It’s like a freight train coming at me
I’m across the booth on the edge of my seat
You don’t make me wait
You say what you came to say


Go on get it out boy say
I’m the only one that makes you this crazy
Come on and tell me how boy
How I’m the only thing you thinking about lately
But what you don’ know, what you don’t know
Is what a girl like me would do for a boy like you


For a girl I’m pretty cool, calm, and collected
For a girl who was getting more than she expected
From an ex-love but here I am
You’re putting your heart in the palm of my hand
I’m trying to act really cool
But inside I’m a lovesick fool

(x2)


Go on say it all boy
Put every last feeling out on the table
Come on it's last call boy
Before the night ends let give this a label
But what you don’ know, what you don’t know
Is what a girl like me would do for a boy like you
For a boy like you

There's been times I've let my faith run thin
Not been the man I should have been
After all the trouble I've been in, I'da gave up on me
I've lived hard and I've lived fast
Lost things I will never get back
Cause someone to look past all of that
God must really love me

When I look at the miracles around me
At the way that I live and the way He forgives
I know He's up there smiling down on me
And I believe the only reason why
I'm still alive is
God must really love me

Wake up and feel you by my side
The perfect girl, the perfect time
And see the way our future shines
God must really love me

When I look at the miracles around me
At the dream that I live and the gift that he gives
I know he's up there smiling down on me
And I believe the only reason why
I get to live this life is God must really love me

When I showed the worst, He saw the best
He pulled the world right off my chest
Every day I wake up I feel blessed
Yeah, I feel so blessed
God must really love me
God must really love me
God must really love me

I was sittin' outside in the front yard
Lawn chair, kiddie pool, just soakin' up the sun
Old man walks by and said
We got this thing called ambition
Why don't you buy a suit
And go get you some

Like he ain't got enough of his own business
Now he's got to go mindin' mine
Opportunity knocks and I miss it
It ain't no crime
It ain't no crime
If I wanna kick back and kill a little time
It ain't no crime

I was gettin' some pink in my color
Next door lady says, why you always layin' 'round
Fine you man like you
Should be married with some children
Instead of all those honeys
Running in and out

Like she ain't got enough of her own business
Now she's got to go mindin' mine
I don't have a lot of kids and a Mrs
It ain't no crime, it ain't no crime
If I wanna kick back and steal a kiss some time
It ain't no crime

If everybody minded their own business
They'd be too busy to worry 'bout mine
If I live life the way I wanna live it
It ain't no crime, it ain't no crime
If I wanna kick back and chill or steal
A kiss from a girl, I will every time
It ain't no crime
It ain't no crime


I'm just trying to be a father
Raise a daughter and a son
Be a lover to their mother
Everything to everyone
Up and at them bright and early
I'm all business in my suit
Yeah, I'm dressed for success
From my head down to my boots


I don't do it for money there's still bills that I can't pay
I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway
Providing for our future's my responsibility
Yeah I'm real good under pressure, being all that I can be
And I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekends been to strong
I just work straight through the holidays
And sometimes all night long


You can bet that I stand ready when the wolf growls at the door
Hey, I'm solid, hey I'm steady, hey I'm true down to the core
And I will always do my duty, no matter what the price
I've counted up the cost, I know the sacrifice
Oh, and I don't want to die for you
But if dying's asked of me
I'll bear that cross with an honor
Cause freedom don't come free


I'm an American soldier, an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines, so sleep in peace tonight
American soldier, I'm an American
An American
An American Soldier




Those high heels with that sun dress
Turquoise heart hanging 'round your neck
Red lips like wine, want to drink them up
And keep on drinking' 'til you make me drunk

Tied up hair, want to let it down
And just let the rest fall to the ground
You take beautiful to the max
Can't help myself when you look like that


Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you


There's a million stars dancing in the sky
A picture perfect moon so bright
But I don't care, I'm looking at you
From where I stand you can beat the view


Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you


My eyes have seen
Some amazing things
But girl, my eyes aren’t seen
Nothing quite like you, hey baby


Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you

We don't flip the bird, we don't cuss an' scream
When the cars don't move when the light turns green
We don't lock our doors when we leave the house
There ain't nobody here that we'd keep out
That's the way we do it in our town, yeah

You never hear me apologise
For growin' up strong, growin' up right
Livin' life by the Golden Rule
Say: "Yes, Ma'am," "Thank You."
Green fields for miles an' miles
Ain't nothin' but country on the radio dial
I thank the good Lord I was born an' bred
Corn fed

Ain't no burnin' flags on our Court House Square
You see Old Glory flyin' everywhere
There ain't no Valley joint with five-star atmosphere
Daddy's home-grown beet's what's for dinner here
An we wash it down with a tall, cold beer, yeah

You never hear me apologise
For growin' up strong, growin' up right
Livin' life by the Golden Rule
Say: "Yes, Ma'am," "Thank You."
Green fields for miles an' miles
Ain't nothin' but country on the radio dial
I thank the good Lord I was born an' bred
Corn fed

Rooster crows, six a.m.;
John Deere pulling that plow again
Spit on your face, hands in the dirt
Ain't nothin' better on God's great earth

You never hear me apologise
For growin' up strong, growin' up right
Livin' life by the Golden Rule
Say: "Yes, Ma'am," "Thank You."
Green fields for miles an' miles
Ain't nothin' but country on the radio dial
I thank the good Lord I was born an' bred;
Well, I thank the good Lord I was born an' bred
Corn fed
Corn fed
Corn fed
Corn fed

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together, if the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together, if the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas now

We ain't East, we ain't West
We ain't left, we ain't right
We ain't black, we ain't white
We just came here to drink
We're all mud flap suburbans
All ball caps and turbans
All prom queens and strippers
Where the whole kitchen sink and in here
We're the same, everyone knows your name

We just raise up our glass
We don't give a rat's ass
If you're a Democrat or Republican
We're happy to be here and that you can see
We're just all drunk Americans

We ain't second ex wives
We ain't cowboys or redskins
We ain't preachers or kingpins
We're just having fun
We're all suits in blue collars
Short orders long hollers
Paper and plastic, too old and too young
Ceos, GEDs, DUIs, FBIs, PHDs

And we raise up our glass
We don't give a rat's ass
If your belly's too fat, or your wallet's too thin
We're happy to be here and that you can see
We're just all drunk Americans

(La-la-la-la-la-la)

All drunk Americans

We been in, we been out
We been cool, we been weird
Thank God we're still here
In the land of the free
And we all, singin' wrong
But we all sing along
Sing along

We just raise up our glass
We don't give a rat's ass
If you're a democrat or republican
We're happy to be here and that you can see
We're just all drunk Americans

In these neon lights
We're all stars we're all straps
And we're all drunk Americans


I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or two


I was laughing at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl, in your own little world
Let me in it


You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying
Yeah, you're my kind of different
And I never seen nothing


Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you


When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy


I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothing


Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you, yeah
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Nothing like you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you


Never seen, never seen nothing like you
Ain't never seen anything like you
Never seen nothin' like you


Ain't it just like a tear
To go and blur out everything
Ain't it just like glass
To fall and break so easily
Ain't it just like love
To leave a mark on the skin and underneath
Yeah, when the pain goes and shadows everything


Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
When it hurts too much to see
Keep your eyes on me


Ain't it the sinner
Who gets all the grace sometimes
Ain't it the saint
Who picks up the pieces left behind
Yeah, and it's human to hurt the one
You hurt the one you love the most
And you can't find the sun


Keep your eyes on me
When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When the light in your heart is
Too burned out to see
Keep your eyes on me


You swear you're all alone sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
And you can't find your way home sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me


Keep your eyes on me
When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When the light in your heart is
Too burned out to see
Keep your eyes on me

Awww Yah!
Billys at the bar, he's been there all night
First ten beers hes had, since her goodbye
HEY! HEY!

She left him broke, in his new truck
He don't smoke, but he lights one up
Temporary fix, for his heartache
Hes hurting bad, but hes feeling great

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him a girl and he holds on tight
Hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billys got his beer goggles on
Hey!

Lot of drunks, get real mean
Theyll pick a fight, over anything
Billy wants to laugh, that's why hes here
You won't see him cry, unless you spill his beer

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl and he holds on tight
Now hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
Right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles.....on

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl he hold on tight
He don't see ugly
Through blood shot eyes
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Cause life looks good, good, good
So good, good, good
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles ... on

There's a for sale sign on a big old' rusty tractor
You can't miss it, Its the first thing that you see
Just up the road, a pale blue water tower
With "I Love Jennie" painted in bright green
Hey That's my Uncle Bill there by the courthouse
He'll be lowering the flag when the sun goes down
And this is My town
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is my town
(Nana na na na)

One, two, three baby don't think twice
Just like that you got a brand new life
Hop in this truck and run through the red lights
Yeah where you want to go baby name the town
We can go up north, we could head down south
Roll down the windows with the radio loud
Come on turn it up, yeah
Start living your life
On the double leave your troubles behind
You and me, we're going to be alright


You could be a blackbird
On the country street
Hiding from the world with a broken wing
But you better believe you're going to fly with me
You could be a songbird from New Orleans
Scared of the rain just as scared to sing
But you better believe you're going to fly with me


Well, here we are baby in the back of my bed
Suns going down skies turning red
Stars coming out
Baby look at you now
God knows how long but it's been a while
Since I heard you laugh and I seen that smile
Felt that kiss and I can get used to this
Baby I could get used to this


You could be a blackbird
On the country street
Hiding from the world with a broken wing
But you better believe you're going to fly with me
You could be a songbird from New Orleans
Scared of the rain just as scared to sing
But you better believe you're going to fly with me


You're going to fly

There's a king-size bed that ain't been slept in
Dinner on the table; it's sitting there cold again
The front porch light just gave up and burned out
Here you are looking like something the cat drug in
With a worn out story 'bout a-where you've been:
Sweet little words coming out of your mouth

You ain't gonna lie, lie here anymore
You ain't gonna break this heart
Baby, like you did before
You're a silver tongued devil that had me believin'
Every promise you were bound to break
But you ain't getting back through this door:
You don't lie here anymore

You can beg and plead an' say that you're innocent;
That you don't know where the time went
But that trace of perfume is a smokin' gun
So you can turn right around
Go back to where you've just been;
Take a look at all you'll be missin'
'Cause you won't be here when the morning comes

You ain't gonna lie, lie here anymore
You ain't gonna break this heart
Baby, like you did before
You're a silver tongued devil that had me believin'
Every promise you were bound to break
But you ain't getting back through this door:
You don't lie here anymore

Hey, yeah: you're a silver tongued devil that had me believin'
Every promise you were bound to break
But you ain't getting back through this door:
You don't lie here anymore
You don't lie here anymore
You don't lie here anymore

Well I can stand beside
Ideals I think are right
And I can stand beside
The idea to stand and fight
I do believe
There's a dream for everyone
This is our country

There's room enough here
For science to live
And there's room enough here
For religion to forgive
And try to understand
All the people of this land
This is our country

From the east coast
To the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway
Back home
This is our country

That poverty could be
Just another ugly thing
And bigotry would be
Seen only as obscene
And the ones that run this land
Help the poor and common man
This is our country

From the east coast
To the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway
Back home
This is our country

The dream is still alive
Some day it will come true
And this country it belongs
To folks like me and you
So let the voice of freedom
Sing out through this land
This is our country

From the east coast
To the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway
Back home
This is our country

From the east coast
To the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway
Back home
This is our country

Jimmy lives in a big house
At sixteen he got a new car
Swears his father doesn't
Know he's alive
Wishes he could be like Tom
Goes fishing with his dad
But Tom in his hand me down clothes
Wishes he could have a car like Jimmy

Oh'o'o'o

Nobody's got it all
Nobody's got it made
No one's got everything
Though it may look that way
And don't it help to know
Where ever those chips may fall
Everybody's got something
But nobody's got it all

Oh'o'o'o,Oh'o'o'o

Lola is a raven beauty
Got men wait'n in line
Never has found the right one
Already married three times
Wishes she could be like Molly
Still married to her
High school sweetheart
But molly walks by the mirror
Wishes she could look more like Lola

Oh'o'o'o

Nobody's got it all
Nobody's got it made
No one's got everything
Though it may look that way
And don't it help to know
Where ever those chips may fall
Everybody's got something
But nobody's got it all

Oh'o'o'o,Oh'o'o'o

That billionare has his problems too
Well,he just might trade places with you

Nobody's got it all
Nobody's got it made
No one's got everything
Though it may look that way
And don't it help to know
Where ever those chips may fall
Everybody's got something
But nobody's got it all

Oh'o'o'o,Oh'o'o'o

Nobody's got it all
Nobody's got it made
No one's got everything
Though it may look that way

But nobody's got it all

Oh'o'o'o,Oh'o'o'o

Nobody's got it all

Oh'o'o'o,Oh'o'o'o

Nobody's got it all


You must have been in a
Place so dark
You couldn't feel the light
Reachin' for you through
That stormy cloud
Now here we are
Gathered in our little hometown
This can't be the way
You meant to draw a crowd


Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
Oh, I had no clue you were
Masking
A troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song


Now in my mind I'll keep you frozen
As a seventeen-year-old
Rounding third to score the
Winning run
You always played with passion
No matter what the game
When you took the stage
You'd shine just like the sun


Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
Oh, I had no clue you were
Masking
A troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song


Now the oak trees are swaying
In the early autumn breeze
A golden sun is shining on my face
Through tangled thoughts
I hear a mockingbird sing
This old world really ain't that
Bad of a place


Oh why, there's no comprehending
And who am I to try to
Judge or explain
Oh, but I do have one
Burning question
Who told you life wasn't
Worth the fight
They were wrong, they lied
Now you're gone and we cry
Cause it's not like you to
Walk away
In the middle of a song


Your beautiful song
Your absolutely beautiful song


Boy, you're gonna know it all
You'll think you're ten feet tall
And run like you're bulletproof
And total a car or two
Boy, you're gonna hate this town
Wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide
But boy, you're gonna love 17
And boy, you'll do some stupid things


You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be a boy


You're gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now, you weren't built for backing down
And boy, there'll be a small town night
And you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes
And when she's in your hands
You'll think you're a man and not a boy
She'll make you lose your mind, boy
She'll be every reason why


You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be...my boy


It's 3am and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep
And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave


But boy, you're gonna come back home
You're gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Til you have a boy
He's gonna know it all
He'll think he's ten feet tall
And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two


It's just an old beat up truck
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket
But what they don’t understand
Is it's the miles that make a man
I wouldn’t trade that thing in for a rocket
What they don’t know is my dad and me–
We drove her out to Tennessee
And she’s still here and now he’s gone
So I hold on


It's just an old beat up box
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don’t look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood
Yeah, that’s what makes it sound so good
To me it's better than brand new
You see this here flat top guitar
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song
So I hold on


To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on


Yeah, baby, looking at you right now
There ain't never been no doubt
Without you I'd be nothing
So if you ever worry about
Me walking out
Yeah, let me tell you something
I hold on
I hold on
Can you hear me, baby?
I hold on
Yeah
I hold on…


To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on

If I told you I was wrong
And wanted you to come back home
I'd be lying
And if I said that we could work it out
And you shouldn't have any doubt
I'd be lying
And if I got down on my knees
In front of God above and swore before the angels
I'd give you my love

I'd be lying next to you at night
Holding on to my whole life
Right back where I belong
Looking deep into your eyes
Man enough to realize
Yeah, hunny I was wrong
And swallowed my pride
And put myself in your shoes
And tell you that I understand
Why you feel the way you do
Baby, I'd be lying, I'd be lying next to you

And if I told you that I loved you
And I'd put no one else above you
I'd be lying
And if I said that you're the one for me
And I'd never set you free
I'd be lying
And if I somehow found the strength
To knock on your front door
And tell you face to face
I won't hurt you anymore

I'd be lying next to you at night
Holding on to my whole life
Right back where I belong
Looking deep into your eyes
Man enough to realize
Yeah, hunny I was wrong
And swallowed my pride
And put myself in your shoes
And tell you that I understand
Why you feel the way you do
Baby I'd be lying, right here lying next to you

If I could swallow my pride
Put myself in your shoes
And tell you I could understand why you feel the way you do
Baby I'd be lying, I'd be lying next to you

Next to you
If I told you I was wrong
If I said that we could work it out
If i got down on my knees

Oh baby I'd be lying...


Oh, yeah


Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and a kiss and "that's too bad"
She said, "I can go to work until you find another job"
I thought, I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hard working dad to being Mr. Mom


Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom


Football, soccer, and ballet
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA
And there's that shopping list she left that's seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make?
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake
It's more than any man can take
Being Mr. Mom


Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the sixteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom


Before I fall in bed tonight
If the dog didn't eat the classifieds
I'm gonna look just one more time


'Cause
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the eighteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
Oh, been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom
Oh, Mr. Mom


Balancin' checkbooks, juggling bills
Thought there was nothing to it
Baby, now I know how you feel
What I don't know is how you do it
Oh
Honey, you're my hero


You're hit then miss, you're fire and ice
You're water and whiskey burn
We kiss, we fight, make up all night
You're the blessing and the curse

But I don’t ever wanna break this chain
I don’t ever wanna walk away
Cause I ain't ever gonna find another lover
Who’ll make me feel this way


Over and over and over, we say that we're through
But I come right back to you


There's a long stretch of love coming down the line
I'm your rock that won’t ever roll and baby, you’ll be mine
I'll be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love


You lift me up, you bring me down
You make me feel alive
You send my heart in overdrive
Every time you kill the lights


Over and over and over, we play this game
Win or lose, we'll never change


There's a long stretch of love coming down the line
I'm your rock that won’t ever roll and baby, you’ll be mine
I'll be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love


Long stretch of love, long stretch of love, long stretch of love
Over and over and over, we play this game
Win or lose, we'll never change


There's a long stretch of love coming down the line
I'm your rock that won’t ever roll and baby, you’ll be mine
I'll be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love

Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love


I don’t wanna break this chain
I ain't gonna walk away in this long stretch of love

I remember when my heart caught the fever
You were standing all alone in the summer heat
I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend
He was as sweet as he could be
But one look at you and I was through
My heart switched up on me

Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now, I'm ruined

In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me?
I should have gone over, right over
I should have never let you leave
But it's the never-knowing that keeps this going
And drives me crazy

Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now, I'm ruined

Just when I thought things were alright
My eyes play tricks on my mind, yeah
Will I ever be satisfied cause all I ever seem to find is a...

Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now, I'm ruined

I am ruined, yeah I'm ruined
Now I am ruined, yeah I'm ruined


Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
From blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Come on now


We'll be walking down the boardwalk
Watching them jaws drop
Ain't nobody lookin' at me
They're all too busy staring at what she ain't wearin'
Can you blame her, it's 100 degrees


Yeah all them girls are jealous
'Cause they know all the fellas are watching her put on a show
Yeah every time they see her
They all just wanna be her
Making country boys' hearts explode


Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
Blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Oh my my
Come on now


She get it from her mama
Back in Tullahoma
Small town Tennessee
She wasn't made for drama
But like Nascar in Daytona
Yeah, that girl was made for me


Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
Blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Woo


Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
Blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather

Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
From blue jeans to leather
Yeah, my girl was made for short skirt weather
Yellow polka dots
From blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Come on now


Day by day my life gets colder
My ice grows thin, as I get older
Peace in peaces, bloody and bruised
I feel so helpless and confused


Because I hear screaming on the left
Yelling on the right
I'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life


Because I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
I can't change the world and make things fair
The least that I can do
The least that I can do is care


I pray and pray for life's salvation
Faith is tried and true in tribulation
Love is lost and lonely, check the news
And with these open arms I'll wait for you






For the life of me, I can't see how the devil keeps enticing me
All u sees a felon, I know god can see whats right in me
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place
When the worst case senerio is my birth place
I'm just trying to keep from falling victim to the murder rate
Take my life lesson convincing the adolescents
There's a god up in heaven, sending down blessings
And your future ain't brighter than your present
Quit Stressing


They re screaming on the left
Yelling on the right
While i'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life


Because I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
Can't walk on water I can't save your sons and daughters
I can't change the world to make things fair
The least that I can do is care


Yeah I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
I can't change the world and make things fair
The least that I can do
Oh is CARE


You're throwing around a lot of serious accusations
Ain't too hard to tell what you're insinuating
You think I'm the one who stole her away
And if not for me she'd still be yours today
We're both men here so why play games
Why don't we call a spade a spade?


Man to man, tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you?
Man to man, look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her, why'd you make her cry?
Man to man, well who cheated who?
You're the one to blame, tell me it ain't true
Man to man, man to man


Well, you think all your anger is justified
Me, I think, it's just your wounded pride
What did you really think she was gonna do?
She's a real woman, not a doormat for you
You want her back, but it's too late
Why don't we just cut to the chase?


Man to man, tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you?
Man to man, look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her, why'd you make her cry?
Man to man, well who cheated who?
You're the one to blame, tell me it ain't true
Man to man


Man to man, tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you?
Man to man, look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her, why'd you make her cry?
Man to man, well who cheated who?
You're the one to blame, tell me it ain't true
Man to man, man to man


Man to man to man to man to man to man to man
Man to man to man to man to man to man to man





Hey girl, wassup
I know it's late but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz, but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say you're taken but I say
Girl you're takin' too long


To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him


I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove


So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
It ain't my business to be all up in
But I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him, break up with him


You would've hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you


I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Just rip it off just like a Band-Aid
Yeah, I know I said it but I'll say it again
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
The way you look at me girl you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
Just break up with him


You may not remember the night that we met
But I've been tossing and turning
And dreaming about you, boy
Ever since

Too long I've waited, yeah
I've played it cool
But that's overrated
Here I go breaking the rules

I'll dial your number
You won't have to wonder
The way that I'm feeling


Maybe tonight
I'll turn your head, yeah
And steal your breath, yeah
And spin your heart
I'll have you right where I want you
Ooh, in my arms, I won't disappoint

With a little bit of kissing
Make you see what you've been missing
I'll finally call you mine
Baby, maybe tonight


You know I've seen you get that look in your eyes
But like a gentleman
You've been pretending
You're just a friend
Playing it shy
It's harder to hide it when you come around

But you can't deny it, boy
I'm calling you out
Come and get closer
The guessing is over
I know what you're feeling



Maybe tonight
I'll turn your head
Steal your breath
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll have you right where I want you
Ooh, in my arms
I won't disappoint

With a little bit of kissing
Make you see what you've been missing
I'll finally call you mine
Baby, maybe, baby
Baby, maybe tonight
Baby, maybe, baby
Baby, maybe tonight

I was young and single
Glad that i was free
Had my whole life ahead
There was nothing stoppin me

Headed out to Vegas, me and all my friends
Just a bunch of clowns runnin round in a town of sin
Ten shots later and one double dare
Met a girl said I do in some chapel out there

That was the best mistake I ever made
The Lord works in mysterious ways
Chose a wrong path all my life
But for once I did something right
And just one look in her and I see
Someone smiling down on me
And I'm not too proud to say
That was the best mistake I ever made

Trying to start a family was the last thing we had planned
Till I came home from work
She had her head in her hands
I could see the worry
Through the teardrops in her eyes
She said, "How we gonna do this when we're barely gettin by?"
We wern't prepared for all those changes in our world
That all changed when the doctor said it's a girl

That was the best mistake I ever made
The Lord works in mysterious ways
Chose a wrong path all my life
But for once I did something right
And just one look in her and I see
Someone smiling down on me
And I'm not too proud to say
That was the best mistake I ever made

There's consequences to the decisions in our lives
Just cause we didn't mean to do it that don't mean that it ain't right

That was the best mistake I ever made
The Lord works in mysterious ways
Chose a wrong path all my life
But for once I did something right
And just one look in her and I see
Someone smiling down on me
And I'm not too proud to say


That don't make me a bad guy
It don't scar my resume
Don't you give me the black eye
Judging by my day to day
Easy to love and hard to keep
Let it dance on the wild side
I'm only good as I got to be
Yeah that don't make me a bad guy


Chiva whiskey in a paper cup
Catch a buzz and I sober up
Coming down with a pot-a-joe
Sleep it off and away I go
Running hard till the money's gone
Half a day and all night long
Get a girl with my Romeo
Yeah love a while then it's adios


That don't make me a bad guy
It don't scar my resume
Don't you give me the black eye
Judging by my day to day
Easy to love and hard to keep
Let it dance on the wild side
I'm only good as I got to be
Yeah that don't make me a bad guy


Yeah like a man I go to work
Feel clean in my dirty shirt
Ain't got a lot but I really try
I've gotten good at getting' by
I'm a son of my daddy's name
Yeah mama's proud and everything
When it's time to make some noise
Boys will be boys


That don't make me a bad guy
It don't scar my resume
Don't you give me the black eye
Judging by my day to day
Easy to love and hard to keep
Let it dance on the wild side
I'm only good as I got to be
Yeah that don't make me a bad guy


Villin or an outlaw
I might kiss you girl
Or catch you with a south paw ain't
Dangerous, cantankerous maybe
Just looking for a real good time
Yeah a real good time

Yeah


That don't make me a bad guy
It don't scar my resume
Don't you give me the black eye
Call me some kind of renegade
Easy to love and hard to keep
Let her dance on the wild side
I'm only good as I got to be
Yeah that don't make me a bad guy


I'm only good as I got to be
That don't make me a bad guy

It's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothin' but a fool's game:
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

Ah, it's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
Ah, nah, nah!

Oh, it ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you
Ooh

Ah, it's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

(Oh, it's a heartache,)
Oh, it's a fool's game
(Nothin' but a heartache:)
Standing in the cold rain
(Standing in the cold rain.)
Feelin' like a clown

(It's a heartache,)
It's a heartache
(Nothin' but a heartache:)
Love him till your arms break
(Love him till your arms break.)
Ah, then he lets you down
Oh, yeah, down

It's late enough all you kids should be home
The policeman says as he takes your beer for his own
You remember wondering what his wife
Thought about his occupation


He knows that you were just chasing a dream
To the town line and then back and over again
So he winks at you girls
And tells you all "I'll see you later"


I was stealing kisses from a boy
Now I'm begging affection from a man
In my house dress don't know you who I am
I'm standing in your kitchen


It's late enough your husband's dinner is cold
So you wrap it up and leave it for him on the stove
It's probably the traffic again
Or another important meeting
And you haven't talked to an adult all day
Accept your neighbor who drives you crazy
When he finally gets in he's sure not in the mood for talking




And hours become days and days become years
And you could burn down this town
If they made matches from fear
Buy you're no worse off than anybody else
Hey don't you even know, don't you even know yourself
So you're standing outside your high school door
The one you walked out of twenty years before
And you whisper to all of the girls, run, run, run



(Walt Aldridge/James LeBlanc)

Well it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

We met at a truckstop
Johnson City, Tennessee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me...mmm hmm
Said, 'Which way are you headed, boy
Do you need some company'

She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it out of town
Next thing she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun

And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

Woo...

Well we pulled up to a motel
In the middle of the night
We were countin' all the money
Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights
Lord we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a sheriff right beside me
Pistol pointed at my side
Oh, Lord...such a disappointing ending
For this modern day Bonnie and Clyde
Yeah...

Whoa
Well...
Woo...hoo

Hey, baby, I'm sitting here lonely, goin' crazy
Hopin' that there's a chance that maybe
Oh, baby, you could drop on by

Yeah darlin', you don't have to give me any warnin'
Make it tonight, make it early mornin'
Oh, darlin', just drop on by

I don't have a clue where you might be
Uptown or just down the street in some smoky bar
Oh, I'm a longin' for you, can't help myself
Sendin' out my S.O.S., wherever you are

Oh, honey
I just want your love, I don't need your money
You can turn my gray skies warm and sunny
Oh honey, would you drop on by?

Oh, you and this bottle of warm red wine
Are both workin' on my mind, and I need you now
To fill this emptiness in my soul
Boy, if you were here, I'd never let go, no way, no how

Hey, sugar
I know if we could get back together
We could make this night last forever
Oh sugar, would you drop on by?

Just drop on by, drop on by
Oh, baby, drop on by


Hey baby, won't you take a little ride with me
Have a look around
See what we can see
I've got the paddle
I've got the boat
Come on baby, I know she'll float


We'll go rolling on the river of love
We'll go rolling on the river of love


Drift away from all these city lights
Might rock a little bit
So hold on tight
Let's get carried away with the gentle flow
Might get caught up in its undertow


We'll go rolling on the river of love
Let's go rolling on the river of love

I got a little ukulele, let me sing you a song
Got a stream of kisses about ten miles long
Dancing on the water in the moonlight beach
Sparkling down through the sea of dreams




River of love, River of love, River of love
Rolling on the river of love
Let's go rolling, rolling on the river of love
Let's go rolling on the river of love
Rolling on the river of love
Rolling on the river of love
Let's go rolling, rolling on the river of love

I knock off with a lot on my mind
From a long hard day
Pull in at home, see you and find
My stress slipping away
Then you run to my arms
And give me a kiss
And nothing else matters
When you hold me like this

Chorus:
Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man
To win your heart all over again
Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste
Nothing but you
I'm in the mood to close the door
Make love tonight like never before
Rush after rush, like waves on the shore
Girl, I'm in the mood

All day long, I'm so strong
Then I hear you speak
I'm drawn to your fire, your signs of desire
Girl, you make me weak
I go drifting away
Like a leaf on the wind
I'm under a spell
Your touch put me in

Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man
To win your heart all over again
Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste
Nothing but you

Yeah, I'm in the mood to close the door
Make love tonight like never before
Rush after rush, like waves on the shore
Girl, I'm in the mood

Girl, I'm in the mood

Girl, I'm in the mood

Girl, I'm in the mood...

I can remember when you fit in the palm of my hand
You felt so good in it; no bigger than a minute
How it amazes me you're changin' with every blink
Faster than a flower blooms, they grow up all too soon

So let them be little
Cause they're only that way for a while
Give 'em hope, give them praise
Give them love every day
Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle
Let 'em sleep in the middle
Oh, but let them be little

I never felt so much in one little tender touch
I live for those kisses, your prayers an' your wishes
An' now you're teachin' me how only a child can see
Tonight, while we're on our knees, all I ask is:

Please, let them be little
Cause they're only that way for a while
Give them hope, give them praise
Give them love every day
Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle
Let 'em sleep in the middle
Oh, but let them be little

The so innocent, precious soul:
You turn around, an' it's time to let them go

So let them be little
Cause they're only that way for a while
Give them hope, give 'em praise
Give them love every day
Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle
Let them sleep in the middle
Oh, but let them be little

Let them be little


I was born in Alabama, but I never knew my Momma
She gave me away at three months old
Some folks in Mississippi took me in and kept me
And treated me just like I was their own


A Holiness preacher man's daughter
And a hard-working sharecropper father


My real Momma was Apache
My real Daddy hell don't ask me
Momma says she don't remember him
And I'm sure somewhere in my history
I've got some slave blood in me
And some folks think that I look Mexican


I never really fit in any place
'Cause there's always a part of me to hate


I'm the rainbow man
That's who I am
I'm a little white and black and red and tanned
And I've got all these different colors in my skins
I'm the rainbow man


Well I know you may doubt it
But if you stop and think about it
There's one common thing that we've all got
People from all countries come here because they're hungry
For what's cooking in America's melting pot


We're all different but the same
Red's the only color in our veins


And I'm the rainbow man
Living in a rainbow land
I'm white and black and yellow and brown and red and tanned
And I'm so proud of all the colors that I am
And I'm the rainbow man


All these colors make me American
I'm the rainbow man

Daddy put in his forty years, got his gold watch, and then they sent him home
I never knew what a struggle was like until I cried tears on his stone
He was just a cog in their wheel lived and died on the layaway plan
But Lord hear the prayer of a Common Man

Alleluia. Is anybody out there?
Alleluia Does anybody care?
Life takes its toll on the heart and soul, but I'm doing the best I can
Lord hear the prayer of a Common Man

A little girl needed braces bad and it cost a couple thousand bucks
She has a beautiful smile but it'll be awhile on my new/used pickup truck
This house of cards I built is mortgaged to the hilt and its sinking in the sand
Lord hear the prayer of a Common Man

Alleluia. Is anybody out there?
Alleluia Does anybody care?
Life takes its toll on the heart and soul, but I'm doing the best I can
Lord hear the prayer of a Common Man

I'm not looking for charity, I just need some clarity
I've got people counting on me. And I'm tired that's all
I'm up against the wall. Lord hear me when I call

Alleluia. I know your up there
Alleluia. I know you care
Life takes its toll on the heart and soul, but I'm doing the best I can
Oh Lord hear the prayer of a Common Man

There's no music, no confetti
Crowds don't cheer, and bells don't ring
But you'll know it, I can guarantee
When the right one comes along

What they're thinkin', what you're feelin'
You no longer have to guess
All those questions are finally put to rest
When the right one comes along

Every single broken heart will lead you to the truth
You think you know what you're lookin' for
'Til what you're lookin' for finds you

In a cold world, it's a warm place
Where you know that you're supposed to be
A million moments full of sweet relief
When the right one comes along

Every single broken heart will lead you to the truth
You think you know what you're lookin' for
'Til what you're lookin' for finds you

It's so easy, nothin' to it
Though you may not believe me now
But I promise, honey you'll find out
When the right one comes along

All that changes is only everything
When the right one comes along

(Rick Giles, Tim Nichols, & Gilles Godard)

One night in New Orleans
On a superbowl Sunday
In a bar with a big screen TV
She was there with some girls
They were down from Montreal
And she walked right up to me

She said, Voulez vous danse?
And she started to move
I said, Baby, I dont parlez vous
She said, "Voulez vous touche
Then she took me by the hand
And I knew that she wanted to dance
Ya c'est la vie baby
Whatever you say
I'll do anything if you put it that way
Voulez vous l'amour
I found out what that means
One night in New Orleans

Looking in her eyes
I saw the French quarter
The way I had never seen
Kisses in Binet's
Strawberry's and champagne
One night in New Orleans

She said Voulez vous danse?
And she started to move
I said, Baby, I dont parlez vous
She said, Voulez vous touche
Then she took me by the hand
And I knew that she wanted to dance
Ya c'est la vie baby
Whatever you say
I'll do anything if you put it that way
Voulez vous l'amour
I found out what that means
One night in New Orleans

I said, How do you say I love you?
She smiled and whipered
Je t'aime ooo
Although I never told her I loved her
That night in New Orleans, I did

She said, Voulez vous danse?
And she started to move
I said, Baby, I dont parlez vous
She said, Voulez vous touche
Then she took me by the hand
And I knew that she wanted to dance
Ya c'est la vie baby
Whatever you say
I'll do anything if you put it that way
Voulez vous l'amour
I found out what that means
One night in New Orleans

Whoa..
Voulez vous l'amour
I found out what that means
One night in New Orleans

Voulez vous l'amour!...

Hey, it's Big D and Bubba, and and we're live on location. We want you to come on out because this is not just a party; it's a parking lot party with Lee Brice!


Johnny's firing up his Coleman grill
We've got 24 tall boys on the chill
Yeah, 14 of 'em's mine
A little marshall tucker on the radio
(can't you see)
You know we're just catkin' a little groove before the show
Yeah, ain't playing nothing slow


At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping' on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party is the after-party
At the parking lot party


Well, The opening band is doin' sound-check
Man, they sound pretty good
Hell, I ain't even bought no tickets yet
Yeah, but that's alright we don't care
Cause all the pretty girls are sitting' right here
Kicking back in the lawn chairs


At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping' on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party is the after-party
At the parking lot party


Woh-oh-oh-oh!
Old Tom's pulling' his guitar out
Woh,-oh-oh-oh!
It's bout time to pass that shine around
Hey-hey-hey!
Show's about to start but we ain't about to leave
Hey hey hey!
It's one hell of a time and it's all for free!


At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping' on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party is the after-party
At the parking lot party


Oh yeah, cam on
Parking lot party
Oh, they're going to have to tow my ass out of here
Parking lot party
Oh, man, damn, girl
Parking lot party
Woo-ooh
Parking lot party
Don't think I've ever seen that before, lord
(hey-hey-hey)

Blush showing on your face
Smell of the hair spray
Springsteen on the radio waves
Lights dancing in a field, spinning Ferris wheel

Get three throws for one-dollar bill
Straw and a coke and you take a sip
Funnel cake burning up your fingertips
Kissing powdered sugar off of your sweet lips, oh yeah, oh yeah

Feels so good, so right, American beauty, American beauty
Fall in love tonight, American beauty, American beauty
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa

We can watch the marching band
We got other plans, stamp on both our hands
In case we want to go back
Road in the dark, find a place to park

We can watch the fireworks start
Laying on a blanket and I pull you to me
Just like a scene from a drive-in movie
Don't have anywhere to go now, do we, no, no, no, oh whoa

Feels so good, so right, American beauty, American beauty
Fall in love tonight, American beauty, American beauty
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, yeah

Colored up like a Rockwell painting
Dance around in my blue suede shoes
Apple pie, like a momma's baking
Look around, I love the view, oh, yes I do

Feels so good, so right, American beauty, American beauty
Fall in love tonight, American beauty, American beauty
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah

Laying on a blanket and I pull you to me
Just like a scene from a drive-in movie
Don't have anywhere to go, now, do we
American beauty, American beauty, American beauty

She was comin to town on a whirlwind tour
And my baby just had to go
So I stood in line for 16 hours for a 90-minute show
I spent 87 dollars for nosebleed tickets
And another 20 on a beer
It kinda looked like Madonna but a whole lot smaller
I couldn't really tell from there

*Chorus*
I want my money
I want my money back
I know its gone I should move on
But that don't change the fact
It just ain't right
No way nobody should do somebody like that
So where's my money
I want my money back

I spent 4 long years fillin up my head with a higher education
They promised me the skills I need to improve my situation
45 grand bought a long black gown and a tassel on my hat
Now I'm qualified to super-size
And say do you want fries with that

*Chorus*
I want my money
I want my money back
I know its gone I should move on
But that don't change the fact
It just ain't right
No way nobody should do somebody like that
So where's my money
I want my money back

I know I'm only dreamin, yeah
I'm never gonna see it again
But it doesn't hurt to ask

It just ain't right
No way nobody should do somebody like that
I want my money
Where's my money
Find that money cuz I need my money
Gimme my money
I want my money back
Gimme my money back
Gimme my money back
I want my money back

I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage is done
Baby, Baby, Baby tell me why
You got to make me, make me, make me cry
If I told you once I told you a thousand times
You can't knock me off my feet
When I'm already on my knees

Chorus:
Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage is done

Baby, baby, baby tell me how
You think your gonna live without my love now
I don't know why you got to keep coming around
Creeping up my street, boy you can't bother me

Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage is done

I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage is
I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage is done

((Ohh))

Don't knock on my door


I am not the kind you take home to mama
I am not the kind to wear no ring
Somehow I always get stronger
When I'm on my second drink

Even though I hate to admit it
Sometimes I smoke cigarettes
The Christian folks say I should quit it
And I just smile and say "God Bless"


Because I heard Jesus He drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine


Daddy cried when he saw my tattoo
But said he loved me anyway
My brother got the brains of the family
So I thought I'd learn to sing




I'll fly away from it all one day
And I'll fly away
These are the days that I will remember
When my names called on a roll
He'll meet me with two long-stemmed glasses
And make a toast to me coming home



And I bet He'd understand
Understand a heart like mine
Oh yes He would


I got a call from my best friend this evening
He said he wasn't going out with us guys on Friday night
Yeah, he was going to change for his new found flame to keep her satisfied
And I just laughed and said, "Hey man, well go ahead and try"


Because I gave up smoking, women and drinking last night
It was the worst fifteen minutes of my life


Now I've heard it said that too much fun will kill you
And I'll be the first to tell you that I don't want to die
Too many twelve ounce curls, pretty girls and parties ain't advised
Well, take it from me don't believe all that hype




Well, you could get hit by a truck tomorrow
So you might as well raise a little hell tonight




Man, it was the worst fifteen minutes of my life
That's right


I know you scared of that cock-a-doodle-do
Don't worry he ain't going to hurt you
I know you ain't never milked a cow before
You ain't never slung hay from a second floor barn door
You never heard of Daisy or of Ellie May
Well, that's okay cause we got all day


Honey, back that thing up
Throw it in reverse, let daddy load it up
Honey, back that thing up
If you going to work a farm you got to learn to drive a truck
Honey, back that thing up


Yeah, yeah, right back here
You ain't looking too at home in them cowboy boots
But them pigtails and cutoffs work on you
You going to learn to love this kinda life
You're going to fit right in, now shut up and drive and




We still got a lot to do, open the gate water the mule
Ain't no time to play today, no rolling in the hay




Come on throw her in reverse darling
And get it on back here to daddy
I need you to pull her on the other side of the barn now
Now, now you got to turn them wheels
There you go, now crank her back just a hair right there


It ain't complicated
Well, I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow but baby I ate it
They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes and tell me that you're sorry
Well you might as well throw gasoline on a fire
The way you lie


You lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well, You lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well, You lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie


That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys and baby I believed you
So why you lookin' so nervous
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now and do the whole wide world a service
Well my daddy's gonna straighten you out like a piece of wire, like a piece of wire
The way you lie


You lie like the man with the slick back hair who sold me that Ford
Well, You lie like the pine tree in the back yard after last month's storm
Well, You lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie


Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive to the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long bridge
And then I'm not gonna cry, well, maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring that you put on my finger
Give it a big ol' fling and watch it sink
Down, down, down
And there it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around


Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well, You lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well, You lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie
Well it's what you do, it's who you are


Baby you could steal my heart like Jesse James
Come in, guns blazin', just like ol' John Wayne
Well now's your chance to save the girl
Better take it 'fore it's gone
Yeah you better get your boots on


Love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Ride me off in the sunset
Outlaws makin a run for it
Well come on boy, be my cowboy
Keep me by your side all night
And hold me tight like a pearl handle .45
And just let me be the whiskey on your breath
And love me like the wild, wild, wild west


Wanna feel like we jumped a train to Santa Fe (desperados makin our getaway)
Like we're desperados makin' our getaway (like we jumped a train to Santa Fe)
I wanna hide away on some prairie
Underneath a blanket of stars
And just get lost in your arms


And love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Ride me off in the sunset
Outlaws makin a run for it
Well come on boy, be my cowboy
Keep me by your side all night
And hold me tight like a pearl handle .45
And just let me be the whiskey on your breath
And love me like the wild, wild, wild west


Love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Love me like the wild, wild, wild west


Love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Ride me off in the sunset
Outlaws makin a run for it
Well come on boy, be my cowboy
Keep me by your side all night
And hold me tight like a pearl handle .45
And just let me be the whiskey on your breath
And love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Love me like the wild west


Baby you could steal my heart like Jesse James
We'll go out, guns blazin', just like ol' John Wayne

First one to kiss me
Now the last to know
That i'll be leaving in the morning
I can't believe it's you i'm letting go
And how this comes without a warning
I know it's not the same
If you could find a way to set me free
You'll still have me
I'll be your go to girl
The one that you can run to
Anytime you'll ever need me i'll be there
Yeah i'm your go to girl
The only one you know who
Loves you like i do
Your go to girl
I met somebody and i just can't lie
I feel so good it makes me crazy
I know this hurts you but you have to try
To understand it doesn't change me
Whenever trouble comes
You'll never have to wonder what to do
I promise you
I'll be your go to girl
The one that you can run to
Anytime you'll ever need me i'll be there
Yeah i'm your go to girl
The only one you know who
Loves you like i do
Your go to girl

You and me
Are gonna be alright
Hold on

The one that you can run to
Anytime you'll ever need me i'll be there
Yeah i'm your go to girl
The only one you know who
Loves you like i do
Your go to girl
You can always come to me
Your go to girl
I'll be your go to girl


I'm just flesh and bone, heart and soul
And I've earned a couple scars
I've let once in a lifetime kind of things slide right out of my arms
I've struck out, I've been knocked down more times than I can count
But that don't matter now


'Cause when you smile I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not saying that I'm perfect oh 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl I'll give you my best shot


You saw a spark inside of me that no one else could find
Your good morning eyes, they get me high
Girl you're always on my mind


'Cause when you smile I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not saying that I'm perfect oh 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl I'll give you my best shot


When I saw you for the first time
I knew I'd found amazing grace
It's like angels singing every time I hear your name
'Cause when you smile I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you, I'm not the man I was before you


When you smile I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not saying that I'm perfect oh, God knows I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl I'll give you my best shot


I'm gonna give you, I'll give you my best shot
I'm gonna give you, gonna give you, yeah
Whoa whoa yeah
Whoa yeah


Well I've been saved by the grace of southern charm
I got a mouth like a sailor and yours is more like a Hallmark card
If you want to pick a fight well I'm going to have to say good night
I don't have to be hateful, I can just say bless your heart
And even though I don't belong with your high life friends
Doesn't mean we don't get together and try to make amens
It's easier can't you see let's agree to just disagree
We don't have to like each other but its sure fun to pretend


So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common you will see
We're just like you, only prettier


Everybody says you got to know your enemies
Even if they only weigh a hundred pounds and stand five foot three
If you just smile and behave you could always get your way
It's a universal plan that'll get you where you can in all societies







Well I'll keep drinkin' and you'll keep gettin' skinnier
I'm just like you, only prettier


Yeah yeah
That's right


We talk about your work how your boss is a jerk
We talk about your church and your head when it hurts
We talk about the troubles you've been having with your brother
About your daddy and your mother and your crazy ex-lover
We talk about your friends and the places that you've been
We talk about your skin and the dimples on your chin
The polish on your toes and the run in your hose
And God knows we're gonna talk about your clothes
You know talking about you makes me smile
But every once in awhile


I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my my my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, usually, but occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)


We talk about your dreams and we talk about your schemes
Your high school team and your moisturizer cream
We talk about your nanna up in Muncie, Indiana
We talk about your grandma down in Alabama
We talk about your guys of every shape and size
The ones that you despise and the ones you idolize
We talk about your heart, about your brains and your smarts
And your medical charts and when you start
You know talking about you makes me grin
But every now and then


I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my my my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, usually, but occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
(I wanna talk about me) (me, me, me, me)
(I wanna talk about me) (me, me, me, me)


You you you you you you you you youyouyouyouyou
I wanna talk about me


I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my my my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, usually, but occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
Oh me


Back this hitch up into the water
Untie all the cables and rope
Step onto the astro turf
Get yourself a coozie
Let's go

Who said anything about skiing?
Floating is all I want to do
You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque


On the pontoon
Making waves and catching rays up on the roof
Jumping out the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mmmmmmm motorboating


(Hoo hoo hoo)


Reach your hand down into the cooler
Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue
Try to keep it steady as you recline on your black inner tube




(Hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo hoo hoo)


5 mile an hour with aluminum side
Wood paneling with a water slide
Can't beat the heat, so let's take a ride




On the pontoon
(Hoo hoo hoo)
On the pontoon
(Hoo hoo hoo)

Back this hitch out into the water
On the pontoon


(Hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo hoo hoo)

You walked in shining brighter than a headlight
Turning every head like a diamond in a coal mine
Packing more punch than a Mississippi fist fight
Oh oh my my

Walked my way, took my hand, said "Let's go"
Had more game than the Mandalay Casino
Thought I hit the jackpot, I was on a good roll
Showed you what I know

Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling out of the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me about boys like you
Too good to be true

Before I knew it my heartstrings unwound
I fell faster than a cannonball straight down
Everybody talking all over this now:
"Look there he goes again"

Lie lie lied like a politician
Shoulda read the headlines, paid more attention
To my suspicions, my intuition
I shoulda listened

Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling out of the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me about boys like you
Too good to be true

I shoulda seen it from a mile away
I should have called a spade a spade
I shoulda known that you're

Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling out of the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me about boys like you
Too good to be true

Too good to be true

You're just too good to be (too good to be)
You're just too good to be (too good to be)
You're just too good to be true
Too good to be true
You're just too good to be
You're just too good to be
You're just too good to be true

Once was a thought inside my head
'Fore I reached thirty I'd be dead
Somehow on and on I go
I keep on rollin' with the flow

Folks said that I would change my mind
I'd settle down and do just fine
But I still love rock 'n roll
I keep on rollin' with the flow

I got my angel raising kids
I'm raising hell just like I did
I got a lot of crazy friends
And they forgive me of my sins

Some might be calling me a bum
'Cause I'm still out here having fun
Jesus loves me yes I know
I keep on rollin' with the flow

I got my angel raising kids
I'm raising hell just like I did
I got a lot of crazy friends
And they forgive me of my sins

Can't take it with you when you're gone
But I want enough to get there on
And I ain't never growing old
I keep on rollin' with the flow

Keep on rollin' with the flow


She was born in Kansas City
Raised in Arkansas
Fell in love with an ex-Marine
She already had three babies
He had one of his own
They came together
For another and me
Our family never shared
The same last name
But our family
Was a family, the same
(And they say)
Blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love is
Thicker than blood


Wreck out on the highway
Rain falling down
Lord, he must have
Fell asleep at the wheel
There's a number of people
Just standing around
Lord, I can't condemn
The fear that they feel


For that river of red
Could be the death of me
God, give me strength
And keep reminding me
That blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love is
Thicker than blood


And if blood is
Thicker than water
Then what are we fighting for?
We're all sons and daughters
Of something that
Means so much more


I see it on my TV
But I can't understand
Lord, it's one
Big contradiction to me
How in god's name
We love thy neighbor with fists
In our hands
And kill each other
When we just don't agree


Why can't we see the walls
We can't see through?
And see what God's
Been telling me and you
(And that is)
Blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love
Love is thicker than blood

Last night, I dreamed I was a kid again
All the things I used to do, I went and did again
Spent the afternoon with my best and closest friend
Wandering through the days we thought would never end

It was back when I'd still get things from Santa Claus
Back when he believed in me and overlooked the flaws
That can grow inside until it hides
The perfect little boy inside the man

I'm not a kid anymore, but I still believe
That those miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh
And the elves still make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys

Tonight, I'll climb back in that bed again
Try to live out all my dreams inside my head again
After Christmas Eve, with my best and closest friend
Who still believes the world's greatest dad just tucked him in

And I know that he'll be looking out for Santa Claus
And I'm sure beyond a doubt he'll overlook the flaws
That will grow inside until it hides
This perfect little boy inside a man

I'm not a kid anymore and I still believe
That those miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh
And the elves do make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys


My girl is rocking that Billabong bikini like she’s sponsored
Asking me if I can rub that Coppertone on her
Got a couple bucks but I’m spending them like they pesos
Might be Motel Sixing but it feels like Turks and Caicos


Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Ice has started melting cause it’s always getting hotter


Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation


I got my Solo Cup amplifier, playing all my jams
And my Walgreens beach chair working on my tan
Feels like it’s Jamaica and I’m sippin' on some Red Stripe
But I’m in Decatur, baby, crushing on that Busch light


Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
(I got, I got, I got)
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation


Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Ice has started melting so I’ll take another swallow


Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
You know I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation


(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I’m on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I’m on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I’m on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I’m gonna rehydrate, while I dehydrate, you know


Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation


Sing it to me
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, party like we on vacation
(Yeah dude, just party every time)


If I had amnesia
I wouldn't know how much I need ya
And I wouldn't have to see ya
Every night when I turn off the lights and close my eyes
I wouldn't have to forget you
Or even know I'd ever met you
I wouldn't to regret you or let you wreck me one more time


What I don't know wouldn't hurt me
If I could lose my memory
I think maybe I'd be fine if I just lost my mind
I wouldn't have to replace you
I could just erase you
And I wouldn't have to know how much I need ya


If I had amnesia
Something stronger than tequila
A little pill that would lead you right out of my head
And get me numb instead
If I went a little crazy
The movie got a little hazy
I wouldn't want you to save me
May be, you can play me one time


What I don't know wouldn't hurt me
If I could lose my memory
I think maybe I'd be fine if I just lost my mind
I wouldn't have to replace you
I could just erase you
And I wouldn't have to know how much I need ya


And if I woke up tomorrow
Wasn't thinking about yesterday
And you were just a stranger
It wouldn't kill me to watch you walk away


And what I don't know wouldn't hurt me
If I could lose my memory
I think maybe I'd be fine if I just lost my mind
I wouldn't have to replace you
I could just erase you
And I wouldn't have to know how much I need ya
If I had amnesia, if I had amnesia

Outside my window
I see a red bird singin'
Sittin' on a wire
Wish I knew what he's thinkin'
Outside my window
I see a couple kissin'
Huggin' and a-lovin'
Man, that's just what I've been missin'

These days when everything is crazy
Some things are never ever changing

You still need stars when you're wishin' at night
A best friend to set you right
A good laugh, a warm bath
And a beautiful song you can sing along to
Good news that'll make you cry
All the little things that money can't buy
No wars, no more, just a big rainbow outside my window

La la la la la la

Outside my window
I see the bluest ocean
Sails in the sunlight
Rockin' in the sweetest motion
Outside my window
I hear a church bell ringin'
Nobody fightin'
Over what hymn they're singin'

I know I'm dreamin' like a child
But some things just don't go out of style, like

You still need stars when you're wishin' at night
A best friend to set you right
A good laugh, a warm bath
And a beautiful song you can sing along to
Good news that'll make you cry
All the little things that money can't buy
No wars, no more, just a big rainbow outside my window

La la la la la la
Outside my window
La la la la la la

Outside my window I see a flag that's wavin'
Hands joined together, everybody's celebrating
(Yeah!)

La la la la la la (Outside my window)
La la la la la la (Everybody's lookin' outside my window)

You still need stars when you're wishin' at night
A best friend to set you right
A good laugh, a warm bath
And a beautiful song you can sing along to
Good news that'll make you cry
All the little things that money can't buy
No wars, no more, just a big rainbow outside my window

La la la la la la (Outside my window)
La la la la la la (Outside my window)
La la la la la la (Outside my window)
La la la la la la (Everybody look outside my window!)

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la (Outside outside)


Go ahead and take your best shot
Let her rip, give it all you've got
I'm laid out on the floor, but I've been here before
I may stumble, yeah I might fall
Only human, aren't we all?
I might lose my way but hear me when I say
I will stand back up


You'll know just the moment when I've had enough
Sometimes I'm afraid, and I don't feel that tough
But I'll stand back up


I've been beaten up and bruised
I've been kicked right off my shoes
Been down on my knees more times than you'd believe
When the darkness tries to get me
There's a light that just won't let me
It might take my pride, and my tears may fill my eyes
But I'll stand back up


I've weathered all these storms
But I just turn them into wind, so I can fly
What don't kill you makes you stronger
When I take my last breath
That's when I'll just give up


So go ahead and take your best shot
Let her rip, give it all you've got
You might win this round but you can't keep me down
Because I'll stand back up




When you put two and two together
You figure out love's got four letters
I shoulda known that when I met her
But she had to spell it out for me
After all that second guessing
It's been a long hard history lesson
Hell that's a class I got an F in
But now I understand perfectly


She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah she’s got a way
She’s got a way with words
Yeah she's got a way with words


Little words like "I" and "do"
Lying, cheating, screwed
Yeah all the words I thought I knew
They got a brand new meaning now


She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah she’s got a way
She’s got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah she's got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh)
She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah she’s got a way
She’s got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah she's got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh)


She's got a way with words
She's got a way with words
Yeah she's got a way with words


Baby since you have been gone
I leave the TV on
Got to hear somebody's voice
I just need some kind of noise
I lay some pillows down
To wrap my arms around
I pretend I'm holding you
I know it is sad but it is what I do
To keep me from going crazy


I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Oh, but I don't do lonely well


I got some real good friends
Check on me now and then
Try to get me out at night
They say I need to get a life
It is easy to say alright
When you're not the one going crazy


I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Oh, but I don't do lonely well


Here comes another sunset
Here comes another long night
I am not over you yet
No, I am not over you yet


I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Oh, but I don't do, don't do lonely well
Oh, no no, don't do lonely well


Fancy cars and diamond rings
I seen all kinds of shiny things
I should be feeling like a king
But lord I don't

Great big towns, so full of users
Make a million, still a loser
Some may bet on you to win
Most hope you won't

Living wild, is no mercy being free
When it brings you to your knees
Can't keep lying


I've seen the road now
I know just what I need
To find my way back to Tennessee
I'm going home now
To Southern, is so sweet
And find my way back to Tennessee


I was only seventeen
I lived behind my beauty queen
I turned my back on everything
And everyone

Rooms with lots of pretty faces
Still don't fill the empty spaces
Wandering where Amazing Grace is
There is none, no

Now I know, there's no comfort in this world
God I miss that hometown girl
Want to hold her



All this time I was chasing after dreams
It was right in front of me
I was lost without her




Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney
So mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him


Well, they thought I was fast a sleeping
They thought that I was tucked in bed
They never thought I'd come a peeping
Or that I'd hear what was said

Santa put his arm around mama
And mama put her arm around him
So if Santa Claus is not daddy
Then I'm a going to tell on him




I never saw Dancer or Prancer
I never heard the sleigh bells ring
I never saw the red nosed reindeer
Like they show on the TV screen
But he sure brought a lot presents
So Santa Claus he must have been
Well, he sure looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him




Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him

Sometimes life can get a little dark
I'm sure I've got bruises on my heart
Here come the black clouds full of pain
Yeah, you can break away without the chains
Your love is like a red umbrella
Walk the streets like Cinderella
Everyone can see it on my face
So let it rain, it's pourin' all around me
Let it fall, it ain't gonna drown me
After all I'm gonna be okay, so let it rain
You can wear your sorrow like an old raincoat
You can save your tears in a bottle made of gold
But the glitter on the sidewalk always shines
Yeah, even God needs to cry sometimes
Your love is like a red umbrella
Always there to make me better
When my broken dreams are fallin' from the sky
Let it rain, it's pourin' all around me
Let it fall, it ain't gonna drown me
After all I'm gonna be okay, so let it rain
Oh, let it rain, let it fall, I'm gonna be okay, so let it rain
Let it wash my tears away
Tomorrow's another day, yeah
So let it rain, it's pourin' all around you
Let it fall, it ain't gonna drown you
After all I'm gonna be okay, so let it rain
Oh, let it rain, let it fall, I'm gonna be okay
So let it rain, it's pourin' all around me
Let it fall, it ain't gonna drown me
After all I'm gonna be okay, so let it rain
Oh, let it rain, let it fall, I'm gonna be okay, so let it rain
Oh, let it rain

Mmmm, yeah, yeah

I been tryin' for a long time
To find the combination to your heart
I been a true friend, I let you in every part of me
Still there you are sayin' you don't know
If I'm someone you can believe
So what is it, baby, you can't chance?

Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you?
Can't you tell by the way that you make me move?
I'm all caught up with the things you do
Please believe me: what else can I do?
Can't you tell I love you?
Yeah

It's like you, you you don't feel it's a big deal
For me to put my heart and soul on the line
I got news, it's for me an' for you: yeah, I might be crazy
I don't believe you'll find anybody else
Who will give you as much as me
Stop your second guessing girl, what's it gonna be?

Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you?
Can't you tell by the way that you make me move?
I'm all caught up with the things you do
Please believe me: what else can I do?
Can't you tell I love you?
Yeah

When you hold me; when you kiss me;
When you whisper my name in the night
When you say you can't resist me
What's left to analyse?

Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you?
Can't you tell by the way that you make me move?
I'm all caught up with the things you do
Please believe me: what else can I do?

Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you?
Can't you tell that you make me move?
I'm all caught up with the things you do
Please believe me: what else can I do?
Can't you tell I love you?
Oh, I love you


I've cried an ocean of salty tears, so torn apart by love
Struggled through so many lonely years, dying for a lover's touch
But now that I'm lying here safe in your arms
Baby I would go through it all again


I'd fall back down on my knees
Spend desperate years lost at sea
Baby, to get to you
I'd go though every heartbreak, lose every last bit of faith
Baby, to get to you
Recry every hard tear
Face every dark fear
Just to feel the sun break through
Baby, to get to you


Baby, I was convinced that I'd been abandoned by God
That I was one in a million souls, somehow He forgot
Now that I've found you it makes perfect sense
And I would go through it all again


I'd fall back down on my knees
Spend desperate years lost at sea
Baby, to get to you
I'd go though every heartbreak, lose every last bit of faith
Baby, to get to you
Recry every hard tear
Face every dark fear
Just to feel the sun break through
Baby, to get to you


I'd fall back down on my knees
Spend desperate years lost at sea
Baby, to get to you
I'd go though every heartbreak, lose every last bit of faith
Baby, to get to you
Recry every hard tear
Face every dark fear
Just to feel the sun break through
Baby, to get to you


I've cried an ocean of salty tears
Baby, to get to you


My shoulder still burns
My head still hurts
There's sand from your shoes in my floorboard
Lipstick on my straw, you're crying out
I paint it in my rear view
My speaker still blasts that song
That you turn me on to


It's like that blue water ran up the highway
The salt air is pulling on my tailgate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
Cause you and the beach follow me home


Still hear your words saying we can't do this
Cause you're up there and I'm down here
Baby let's go on and face it


It's like that blue water ran up the highway
It's so intense, it's blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
Cause you and the beach follow me home
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
´Cause there you are everytime I close my eyes
Is like we never even say good bye
It don´t feel like you are really gone
You and the beach follow me home

How long has it been
How long have you held it in
And how long will you wait
Before you let somebody take your breath away, again

I wanna be the one who turns you on
Makes love till the lonely's gone
Be the man you have dreamed of all your life
I swear I'll make it last untill tears of joy come pourin from your eyes
I wanna make you cry

Tell me what to do
And I'll do what you want me too
Cause darlin I believe
That I have fallen hopelessly and helplessly for you

I wanna be the one who turns you on
Makes love till the lonely's gone
Be the man you have dreamed of all your life
I swear I'll make it last untill tears of joy come pourin from your eyes
I wanna make you cry

I swear I'll make it last untill tears of joy come pourin from your eyes
I wanna make you cry

I wanna make you cry


We saw the moon in Colorado
Made music in Tennessee
We found the gold of El Dorado
It's so good, making love, you and me
These arms, they will never hold another
These eyes, they are blind to any other


These lips, no other girl will ever kiss
This heart, it will always feel like this 'cause


Only God could stop me loving you
Only God could tell me not to
He sent you from Heaven
Just to make my dreams come true
When he opened the door
That you came walking through
Only God could stop me loving you


Now we struck oil in Oklahoma
And we won the Oscar in Hollywood
We climbed the canyons of Arizona
And baby, making love never felt so good
These lips, no other girl will ever kiss
This heart, it will always feel like this 'cause






There ain't no girl
In the whole wide world
Who could take away my heart
& there ain't no man to steal your
Hand & tear us apart
But there is one god in heaven above
Who gave me love strong enough
To cam my heart
Cause' Only God could stop me from loving you
Only God could tell me not too


I found it in an old cigar box
A timeless treasure my daddy forgot he put there
A gold faced elegant pocket watch
He carried in his overall for all those years
And i wound it up and i held up to my ear
And i listened as it ticked away the years
And it took me back there in his lap underneath an old shade tree
As he wound it for the hundreth time and spoke these words to me

He said time waits on no one
Like a train it just rolls on
It's more precious than gold
With hands you can't hold
You think it won't run out but it will
And boy only a woman can make time stand still

Well i remember plain as day
The good lord called pop away and how i cried
Well it seemed like slow motion then
Now i can't believe how long it's been
Oh he was right time does fly
Today i'm gonna tell that boy of mine
Pass daddy's words of wisdom down the line

That time waits on no one
Like a train it just rolls on
It's more precious than gold
With hands you can't hold
You think it won't run out but it will
Only a woman can make time stand still

Yeah he said only a woman can make time stand still
I found it in an old cigar box
A timeless treasure my daddy forgot he put there

I swear this front porch air
Smells sweeter tonight
Car's broke down
Got bills piled up inside

Me and you out on this swing
I ain't worried about a thing 'cause

It feels so right hugged up tight
Look who's back in love
I'm fallin' for you darlin'
Look who's back in love

I've been the heartbreak kid
I'll admit love had got me down
But girl we got a thing
There ain't no gettin' around

It's like summer, like a song
I can feel it coming on, oh

It feels so right hugged up tight
Look who's back in love
I'm fallin' for you darlin'
Look who's back in love

That old sun sinkin' low
And I know it's gonna disappear
I ought to grab a blanket
It's bound to get cold out here

But when you hold me like you do
I don't wanna move 'cause

It feels so right hugged up tight
Look who's back in love
I'm fallin' for you darlin'
Look who's back in love

I called my momma, I told her about ya
Look who's back in love
Look who's back in love
Look who's back in love

Last night we went to bed not talking
'Cause we'd already said too much
I faced the wall, you faced the window
Bound and determined not to touch

We've been married seven years now
Some days it feels like 21
I'm still mad at you this morning
Coffee's ready if you want some
I've been up since five
Thinking about me and you
And I've got to tell you
The conclusion I've come to

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while

For now, you might as well forget it
Don't run your fingers through my hair
Yeah that's right, I'm being stubborn
No, I don't want to go back upstairs
I'm going to leave for work
Without a goodbye kiss
But as I'm driving off
Just remember this

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while
I just want to be mad for a while
I just want to be mad for a while
I just want to be mad for a while


There's a moment I can see
I close my eyes from this window seat
It's you and me under a midnight sky
Leaning on your car in the parking lot
Wish I could go back to that spot
The second right before we said goodbye


But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
But I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there


I wish there were runway lights
Where they could land this thing tonight
You'd be right there waiting at the gate
Ooh, and I would stop you just before
You're reaching for that drivers door
If yesterday could be today


But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
But I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there


Ooh, yeah
She's down there somewhere
If I could go back there


But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
But I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there
Naw, this plane don't go there


I wipe a tear away
As I give up on this day
Wonderin' if I'll ever find someone
When I close my eyes and dream
There are words I'm whispering
Someday love will come
I won't have a doubt
My head up in the clouds
And certain as the morning sun
I will always believe
There's somebody just for me
Someday love will come


Someday
After all these nights of waiting
And someday
I'll find a chance worth taking
Saving me
From wakin' up alone
My heart will find a home
Someday


And she'll be so beautiful
The sweetest miracle
Someday love will come




And when I close my eyes and dream
These are the words I'm whispering
Someday love will come

My friends and me work overtime
All try to walk the bottom line
You've been breathin' down our necks
But soon as we cash our paychecks
We'll be chillin' on my deck, Boss Man

Chorus:
There's nothin' you can do, nothin' you can say
Nothin' you can throw our way come Friday
We've been rubber stampin' paper clippin'
Sortin' fillin' faxin'
It's time to let the good times roll
Nothin' you can say, nothin' you can do
Nothin' that can wreck our mood come Friday
We've been roofin' rakin' truckin' pavin

Packin' stackin' layin' block
Farmin' fencin' monkey wrenchin' pickin' up and droppin' off
We can't wait to punch the clock

Come Friday - yeah!

Gonna fill my igloo full of ice
Stock up on my way home tonight
Light tiki torches and the grill
Put speakers on the windowsill
Play our music loud and dance all night

Repeat Chorus

We'll be horseshoein' barbecuin' flippin'
Sippin' kickin' back
Lawn chairin' music blarin' laughin' havin' us a blast
Work all week until at last-

It's Friday
It's Friday - yeah!
Whoa!

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'll shine up the old brown shoes, put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work if you say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me
I'll shine up the old brown shoes, put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work if you say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?

Solo

I'll shine up the old brown shoes, put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work if you say that you love me
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I want you to want me


Roll into town, step off the bus
Shake off the where you came from dust
Grab your guitar, walk down the street
Sign says "Nashville, Tennessee"


But I have found


It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
In this crazy town


You pay your dues and you play for free
And you pray for a honky tonk destiny
You cut your teeth in the smokey bars
And live off the tips from a pickle jar


'Til you find a cool new sound
And you smile when the record man shoots you down


It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
In this crazy town


One year they repossess your truck
And the next you make a couple million bucks


It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
We love it, we hate it, we all came here to make it
In this crazy town
It's a crazy town

Hey baby whatcha doin' this evening?
Can you meet me down at the railroad tracks?
I got Tom Petty playin' in my Silverado
And I iced down a six-pack, uh-oh

Hey Daisy don't you worry 'bout your mama
Like 007 we can keep it covert
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace on earth


Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers

Hey baby, Mother Nature is waitin'
And love's bloomin' like a cherry tree
Let's buzz around, maybe do some pollinating
Dive on in like honey bees


Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby
Pickin' wildflowers

Take a trail ride if you know what I mean
Hey baby won't you come with me?


Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
Spend a little time, pickin' wildflowers

Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby, You and me baby
Pickin' wildflowers

Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go, pickin' wildflowers?
Pickin' wildflowers?

Well, you filled up my head with so many lies
You twisted my heart 'til something snapped inside
I'd like to give it one more try
But my give a damn's busted
You can crawl back home, say you were wrong
Stand out in the yard and cry all night long
Go ahead and water the lawn
My give a damn's busted


I really wanna care
I wanna feel somethin'
Let me dig a little deeper
No, sorry, nothing


You can say you've got issues, you can say you're a victim
It's all your parents fault, I mean, after all, you didn't pick 'em
Maybe somebody else has got time to listen
My give a damn's busted
Well your therapist says it was all a mistake
A product of the Prozac and your codependent ways
So, who's your enabler these days?
My give a damn's busted


I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, still nothing


It's a desperate situation, no tellin' what you'll do
If I don't forgive you, you say your life is through
C'mon, give me something I can use
My give a damn's busted
Well


I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, man, sorry


Just... nothing
No
You've really done it this time, ha ha
My give a damn's busted

His cows get loose and run right through the fast food parking lots
And Daddy gets calls from the mini-malls
When they're downwind from his hogs
When his tractor backs up traffic, the reception ain't too warm
The city's growing around him, but Daddy won't sell the farm
You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

He worked and slaved in '68, he bought these fields and trees
He raised his corn and a big red barn and a healthy family
He learned to love the woodlands, he can't stand to do them harm. There's concrete all
Around him, but Daddy won't sell the farm

You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

One day he's gonna leave it all to me and I'll start my own branch of the family tree
They'll get the message written on the roof of the barn, Daddy won't sell the farm

You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

We're gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm. Oh you know a country boy can survive


So here you are now, nowhere to turn
It's just the same old yesterday
And you made a promise to yourself
That you were never going to be this way
And the only thing that you've ever known is to run
So you keep on driving faster into the sun


Because everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes


Don't have to find your own way out
You got to voice, let it be heard
Just when it feels you're on a dead end road
There's always somewhere left to turn
So don't give up now
You're so close to a brand new day
Yes, you are and if you just can bear to be alone
I'll stay


Because everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes


Well, maybe I was too caught up to see
What you've been going through and all that I can say is
Oooo, yeah


And everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
A little left to save
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
Got to have someone beside you
Got to have someone beside you
Yes, you do, yes, you do
Everybody, everybody needs somebody sometimes


What if I told you
It was all meant to be
Would you believe me?
Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling
That we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come and now


A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this


Everything changes
But beauty remains
Something so tender
I can't explain
Well, I may be dreamin'
But till I awake
Can we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share


A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this


Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this
Some people wait a lifetime


A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this


Oh, like this
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Oh, like this


There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me


Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me


There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me


Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
(Ooo oo aah aah, ooo oo aaah aah ooo ooo aaah aaah)


Oh, when you need somebody
When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be
Break on me


Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
Break on me
Break on me, baby
Hmmmm

You were juliet and I was into you
And I asked you out till you couldn't say no and you finally felt it too
I drove you down the boulevard, thats where you took my heart
And gave me yours instead and every day you find new ways to be beautiful
You laugh at the garden that we grow in the lawn
Drink coffee in the kitchen with no make up on
Sing all the wrong words to my favorite songs
You're beautiful, and that's beautiful
You got lines on your face from sleeping on me
Call me at work cause you lost your key
Go to buy a dog and you come home with three
You're beautiful, and thats beautiful to me
You turn every head when you walk into a room
But your kindess and your sweetned soul lingers like perfume
Babe you could have gone with romeo but you stayed with me instead
And every day I find new ways that make you beautiful
You say honey give me roses but dont buy red
You need 46 pillows all over the bed
Guess every punch line before its said
You're beautiful and thats beautiful
Whatcha doing with a guy like me?
You're so cool and I'm high tea
I dont deserve to have a girl as beautiful as you
Ya you laugh at the garden that we grow in the lawn
Drink coffee in the kitchen with no make up on
Sing all the wrong words to my favorite songs
You're beautiful, and that's beautiful
You got lines on your face from sleeping on me
Call me at work cause you lost your key
You go to buy a dog and you come home with three
You're beautiful, and thats beautiful to me
You're so beautiful, and that's beautiful to me


We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some shhhh


Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy


But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car


Man, they weren't playing
They sure threw those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em
They didn't fall for it
But I did
You were on the left
I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door


I swear your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy


But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
Ohh, and you were like


Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone


But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car


I fell in love in the back of a cop car
A side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone
I was already gone baby
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Hey, good girl
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What you’re thinking about
You'll see a good boy
Gonna give you the world
But he’s gonna leave you crying
With your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey
But he’ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love
And go and throw away the key
Hey, good girl
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man


Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Better listen to me
He’s low, low, low


Hey, good girl
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding
And a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl
Like every good girl does
Want a fairy tale ending, somebody to love
But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don’t mean much
Hey, good girl
So good for him
Better back away, honey
You don’t know where he’s been


Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he’s low
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Oh, he’s no good, girl
Why can’t you see?
He’ll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah


Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, he’s no good
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find


He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes

If tomorrow all the things were gone I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again with just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars to be living here today

'Cause the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that away

And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

From the lakes of Minnesota, to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston and New York to LA
Well, there's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say that

And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

Dirt road in his old truck
Lined with honeysuckles
Down that old beach bend
Saw the water through the trees
And the way he looked at me
With that sly southern grin
And he said, I hope you know how to swim

Chorus:
We took off our clothes
Through em' in the bushes
Mud between our toes
Bare white tooshes lord
How'd he get me to do it
How he talked me into it
Sunlight on the river glistened
And we were skinny dippin'

Screaming bloody murder
As he pulled me under
He took my breath for awhile
Chills from the Mississippi
Chills from the way he kissed me
We came back up with a smile
I never felt more alive


You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're going to be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"


Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're going to believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're going to be
Fifteen


You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're going to believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen


When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was going to marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried


Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're going to believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la


Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors


Love the taste of a cold beer after work on a Friday
I love to turn it up and burn a bar down with the boys, yeah
I love the sound of four wheels southbound on the highway
But there ain't nothing that I love more than
The sweet sound of your voice


'Cause when it comes to loving you
Yeah all my walls fall down
Your touch in the dark
Lights a fire in my heart
That can't be put out
I swear the world stays still
And the stars shine blue
The angels start singing
A song I believe in
When it comes to loving you


Love the thought of watching college football with my grandad
I love to hear the rain beating on the roof of an old red barn
I love the way Ray Charles sings about Georgia
But there ain't nothing like Sunday mornings
When you're lying in my arms


'Cause when it comes to loving you
Yeah all my walls fall down
Your touch in the dark
Lights a fire in my heart
That can't be put out
I swear the world stays still
And the stars shine blue
The angels start singing
A song I believe in
When it comes to loving you, oh

When it comes to loving you
Yeah all my walls fall down
Your touch in the dark
Lights a fire in my heart
That can't be put out
I swear the world stays still
Yeah the stars shine blue
The angels start singing
A song I believe in
When it comes to loving you
The angels start singing
A song I believe in
When it comes to loving you


Here we are, of what is left of a husband and a wife
With four good kids, who have a way, of getting on with their lives
And I'm not old, but I am getting a whole lot older every day
It's too late to keep from going crazy, I've got to get away


The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love
I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels like this worlds' left you far behind
I don't know why you got to be angry all the time


Our boys are strong now
The spitting image of you when you were young
I hope someday they can see past, what you have become
I remember, every time I said I'd never leave
But what I can't live with is memories of the way you used to be


The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love
I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels like this worlds' left you far behind
I don't know why you got to be angry all the time


Twenty years, have came and went since I walked out of your door
I never quite made it back to the one I was before
And God it hurts me to think of you
For the light in your eyes was gone
Sometimes I don't know why this old world can't leave well enough alone


The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love
I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels like this worlds' left you far behind
I don't know why you got to be angry all the time


See the way you're taking care of your Mama
The way you’re taking care of me
The way you light up any room, girl
You're what this world should be


Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So startin' right now, girl, tell me everything you need


I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you


Girl, you’re more than just the surface
Yeah, you got that heart of gold
So when it comes to loving you, babe
No, it will never get old


Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So startin' right now, girl, tell me everything you need


I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
Good as you, baby




I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
In my take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed (Yeah with you baby)
Never leave "I love you left" unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
Baby, I just wanna be good as you


There ain't nothing like them first loves baby
Remember them high school days
Friday nights, homecomin' dances
Giving my old letterman's jacket away
To old what's her name
But now it's you and me talking on the phone till 4 AM
About anything and everything
Making me feel young again like ain't a damn thing changed
Ain't a damn thing changed


Makes me want to sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll until the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that backseat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again


I thought them feelings was long gone baby
But you take me back in time
Just like spring break in Panama City
The girl from Indiana sure was pretty
But she sure ain't got nothing on you tonight
Because you're like the summer loving don't come or go
Never had to say goodbye
I wake up in the morning feeling like the first kiss
Every time your lips touch mine


Makes me want to sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll until the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that backseat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again


Looking back I wish I could put you inside every memory
(Every memory)
You can be my first love
My first kiss
My first and last everything


Makes me want to sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll until the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that backseat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again


Yeah just like we're 17 again
17 Again
Oh

(Verse 1)
Our houses are protected by the good Lord and a gun
And you might meet 'em both if you show up here not welcome son
Our necks are burnt, the roads are dirt and our trucks ain't clean
The dogs run loose, we smoke, we chew and fry everything
Out Here, Way out here

(Chorus)
We won't take a dime if we ain't earned it
When it comes to weight, brother we pull our own
If it's all backwoods where you live and you're concerned with
Well you can leave us alone
Just worry about John Wayne, Johnny Cash and John Deere
Way out here

(Verse 2)
We've got a fighting side a mile wide but we pray for peace
Cause it's mostly us that end up serving over seas
Hell if it was up to me I'd love to see this Country run
Like it used to be, like it ought to be and just like it's done
Out here, way out here

(Chorus)
Cause we won't take a dime if we ain't earned it
When it comes to weight, brother we pull our own
If it's all backwoods where you live and you're concerned with
Well you can leave us alone
Just worry about John Wayne, Johnny Cash and John Deere
Way out here

(Repeat Chorus)
Our houses are protected by the good Lord and a gun
And you might meet 'em both if you show up here not welcome son

He was standin' in the rubble
Of an old farmhouse outside Birmingham
When some on-the-scene reporter
Stuck a camera in the face of that old man

He said, "Tell the folks, please mister, what are you gonna do
Now that this twister has taken all that's dear to you"
The old man just smiled and said, "Boy, let me tell you somethin'
This ain't nothin'"

He said, "I lost my daddy when I was eight years old
That cave-in at the Kincaid Mine left a big ol' hole
And I lost my baby brother, my best friend, and my left hand
In a no-win situation in a place called Vietnam"

"And last year, I watched my lovin' wife
Of fifty years waste away and die
And I held her hand 'til her heart of gold stopped pumpin'
So, this ain't nothin'"

He said, "I learned at an early age
There's things that matter, and there's things that don't
So if you're waitin' here for me to cry
I hate to disappoint you boy, but I won't"

Then he reached down in the rubble and picked up a photograph
Wiped the dirt off of it with the hand that he still had
He put it to his lips and he said, "Man she was somethin'
But, this ain't nothin'"

He said, "I lost my daddy when I was eight years old
That cave-in at the Kincaid Mine left a big ol' hole
And I lost my baby brother, my best friend, and my left hand
In a no-win situation in a place called Vietnam"

"And last year, I watched my lovin' wife
Of fifty years waste away and die
We were holdin' hands when her heart of gold stopped pumpin'
So, this ain't nothin'"

He said, "This ain't nothin' time won't erase
And this ain't nothin' money can't replace"

He said, "You sit and watch your lovin' wife
Of fifty years fightin' for her life
Then you hold her hand 'til her heart of gold stops pumpin'
Yeah, boy that's somethin'"

"So, this ain't nothin'
No, this ain't nothin'"

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland


Don't need no tab, don't need no VISA
No bouncer looking like a wannabe Vin Diesel
Don't need your friends all getting jealous
Watching you walk in looking so good that you could sell it


Uh-uh, not again
Girl, let's get this party started
Where the party always ends


Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying, stargazing
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house


At the house
Yeah, that's what it's all about


Don't need no plans (nope), no reservations (uh-uh)
Nobody calling me up saying, "Where you at, man? We waiting"
We can keep it on chill (oh, yeah), or get a little obnoxious (uh-huh)
Go ahead and get your freak on, ain't nobody gonna stop us


Uh-uh, girl, just the essentials
You and me, a little Smithworks
Rocking out this residential


Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying, stargazing
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house


Uh-uh, not again
Girl, let's get this party started
Where the party always ends


Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying, stargazing
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house


Yeah, at the house
That's what it's all about
Mmm, yeah
At the house

On the day mama died,she called daddy to her side.And said,"i'll be goin soon
,I know its gonna hurt you both. But, promise me before i go, you'll do what I
Ask of you
In a big red folgers can, hid behind the pots and pans you'll find some money
That i've saved
And in the back of my dresser drawer I put away a little more for a rainy day
Go to town and buy that new guitar cause hes been workin awful hard to get his
Own
To write his songs

What a memory,oh what a memory even in her final moments mom thought of me
What a memory

She was only 35 i was 15 askin why? The lord took her away he must known we
Needed her
She was an angel here on earth i still miss her everyday.with all her friends
And half the town
And her family gathered round i bet she never felt so loved when everybodys
Heads were bowed i did
Best to make her proud as i stood up and i sang rock of ages cleft for me as i
Played it on that new six string
I couldn't help but cry as we said goodbye
Reapeat chorus
Even in her final moments mama thought of me
What a memory, What a memory


Hey girl, it's me, I just called to tell you hi
Call me when you get this
Haven't talked lately so hard to find the time
Give the boys a big kiss
Tell them that I miss them
By the way, I miss you too


I was thinking just today
About how we used to play
Barbie dolls and make-up
Tea parties, dress up
I remember how we'd fight
We'd make up and laugh all night
Wish we were kids again
My sister, my friend


Oh yeah, before I forget I met someone
I think I really like him
I was wondering if I'm jumping the gun
By going out on a limb
And invite him home for Christmas
To meet the family


Seems like just yesterday
You brought home - oh, what's his name?
He had been drinking
What were you thinking?
After dinner he passed out
We can laugh about it now
'Cause we've learned a lot since then
My sister, my friend


Do you think you could come and see me sometime soon?
We could just hang out like we used to


It's late and I should go
But I can't hang up the phone
Until I tell you
What I don't tell you enough
Even though at times it seemed
We were more like enemies
I'd do it all again
My sister, my friend


Long truck bed, hop in it, fire engine red like her lipstick
Out here we can let it go, yeah
Just me and my good friends, jug of wine, lil' sip
Out here baby you just never know
Yeah, these are the days of gold


Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs' on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold


The July sky, so high moon shining by the river side
Stealing hearts and running wild
In our own little world, Tennessee boys and girls running free
Out here it's good times for miles
Yeah, these are the days of gold


Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs' on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold


A little bit of you, a little bit of me
What you want to do, what's it going to be
We can get a wild, we can live free
Or you can shake it for me baby like a tambourine
Slice the watermelon and you spit the seed
Sweat on your back's sticking to the seat
We can sneak off to beat the heat
I'll be buzzing on you honey like a bumble bee


Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs' on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold


I want to dance by the water 'neath the Mexican sky
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight
Are you with me, are you with me?
I want to fall like the Carolina rain on your skin
I want to walk a little too far out on that limb
Take you every place I've been and never been
Are you with me, are you with me?


We can chase the wild dreams, live like crazy
Love me baby, come on, come on, come on
Just throw your arms around me
We can run like we won't run out of time


I want to fly so high that I'll never come down
I want to love so hard, it could rip my heart out
I want to get so lost that I'll never be found
Are you with me? Are you with me?




Are you with me?




Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?


Come on, come on, come on
Just come with me

Everything we use to do went wrong
Haven't shed one tear since you've been gone
I've got my pull out chair, football and beer
Ain't got one worry girl cause you ain't here
I've got my freedom back I'll do whatever I want
I guess this is how it's suppose to be
I can't believe it took this long for me to see

That I love that I hate you, I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you, hasn't been so bad, it's the best time of the year
Cause I see you and I see him, you know I can't help but grin
And soon enough he'll be saying it too
Girl, I love that I hate you
I love that I hate you

Any other break up I'd be jealous
You can't hide behind the makeup girl you're selfish
You got another man following you around
Like a dog doing tricks to your every sound
I can't believe that use to be me and that use to be us

I love that I hate you, I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you, hasn't been so bad, it's the best time of the year
Cause I see you and I see him, you know I can't help but grin
And soon enough he'll be saying it too
Girl, I love that I hate you
I love that I hate you
I love that I hate you

Never thought that I could make it through
But I'm fine on my own with my middle finger salute

That I love that I hate you, I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you, hasn't been so bad, it's the best time of the year
Cause I see you and I see him, you know I can't help but grin
And soon enough he'll be saying it too
Girl, I love that I hate you
I love that I hate you
(I love that I hate you)


I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright


Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright


And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good


It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright


Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright


And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good


Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh




Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a fu man chu


And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good


And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good


I thought that was your voice
I thought that was my car
Now we aren’t ever met before
But I know who you are
You're living in my house
And I'm living in a tent
And don't laugh, this second job of mine
Is paying both our rents
You're out here buying Happy Meals
And I'm eating rice and pintos
You so much as crack a smile at me, man
I'll come through this here window


Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat
Yeah I think that's just about everything
Oh I almost forgot
Do you want fries with that?


Your ketchup's in the bag
And a check is in the mail
I hope your chicken's raw inside
And I hope your bun is stale
I'm supposed to tell you
"Please come back"
But how about this instead?
I hope you both choke on a pickle
Man, that would tickle me to death
I don't know what you're waiting on
You're holding up the line
Oh man, you aren’t got no change coming back
Are you out of your mind?


Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat
Yeah I think that's all there is
Do you want fries with that?


Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat
Yeah I think that about covers it
Do you want fries with that?


I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she’s gone again, and


I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller


My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound


I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller


When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along


I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

Well I'm a runnin' down the road
Tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me
Two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand
And take it easy

Well, I'm a standin' on a corner
In Winslow, Arizona
Such a fine sight to see
It's a girl my Lord
In a flat-bed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love
Is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

Well, I'm a runnin' down the road
Tryin' to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover
Who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love
Is gonna save me

Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy


Where are you now?
Who's holding you now?
When your world stands still, do you remember?
Leave were falling
We were falling
Almost like a dream, do you remember?

Seasons changed
We both changed
Sometimes I go back to when


We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holding forever back then
Do you remember?


Where I am now
Is where I should be now
You're so far away, but always with me

And it seems like
Another life
Whenever I go back to when




We ran, we kissed, we learned to love, to live


We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holding forever back then
Do you remember?
Do you remember?

I stumbled on a preacher Sunday Mornin'
All decked out and made up for T. V
Askin' for some money from God's people
Talkin' all that high theology
Well, I might be just an ol' blue collar
And there's things about the lord that I don't know
But I bet he never had a million dollars
Or wore a lot of stylish fancy clothes

Chorus
'cause Jesus was a country boy
Walkin' down a dirt road with everything that he owned
He never met a stranger
Born in a barn underneath the stars his mama layed him in a manger
Swimmin' in the river
Fishin' for his dinner
Livin' with the sinners like me
Makes me think that Jesus was a country boy
(Oh yes and I believe that Jesus was a country boy
2nd time only)

My daddy never cared much for religion
And my mama worried a lot about his soul
She's hit her knees and pray for him on Sunday
While daddy hit his favorite fishin' hole
You see daddy was a rebel and a rambler
But I always knew he loved my mama so
I never doubted he'd make it to heaven
'cause it's not who you are, it's who ya know
And daddy knew...




I was sitting there selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, "this is where rednecks come from"
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the interstate
Needing directions and I was the man for the job


I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me


I was sitting there thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat and thought, You fool, that could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear in a cloud of dust


I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me


Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me
Or am I really seeing what I think I see
The woman of my dreams coming back to me
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass and sent her right back here to me


Thank God for good directions and turnip greens


These old boots still got a lot of ground
They ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
Under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm going to settle down
I've got news for you


I still got a lot of leaving left to do


And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
So you won't fall for me
If you know what's good for you


Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do


I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So loving me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose


Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do


Girl, you look like you might be an angel
So I won't lie
I could love you like the devil
If you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever for a day or two


But I still got a lot of leaving left to do


I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So loving me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose


Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do
I still got a lot of leaving left to do


Sometimes think the war is necessary
Every night I pray for peace on earth
And I hand down my dollars to the homeless
But believe that every able soul should work


My father gave me my shotgun
That I'll hand down to my son
Try to teach him everything it means


I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong, call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm going
But you sure know where I stand
Hate me if you want to
Love me if you can


I stand by my right to speak freely
But I worry 'bout what kids learn from TV
And before all of debatin' turns to angry words and hate
Sometimes we should just agree to disagree


And I believe that Jesus
Looks down here and sees us
And if you ask him, he would say




Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt
Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand so God made girls


Somebody's gotta make him get dressed up
Give him a reason to wash that truck
Somebody's gotta teach him how to dance
So God made girls


He needed something soft and loud and sweet and proud
But tough enough to break a heart
Something beautiful and breakable that lights up in the dark


So God made girls, God made girls
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
And God made girls (for singing in your front seat)
God made girls (for dancin' to our own beat)
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
And God made girls


Somebody's gotta be the one to cry
Somebody's gotta let him drive
Give him a reason to hold that door so God made girls


Somebody's gotta put up a fight
Make him wait on a Saturday night
To walk downstairs and blow his mind
So God made girls


Something that can wake him up and call his bluff and drag his butt to church
Something that is hard to handle
Somethin' fragile to hold him when he hurts


So God made girls, God made girls
He stood back and told the boys, I'm 'bout to rock your world
And God made girls (for singing in your front seat)
God made girls (for dancin' to our own beat)
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
And God made girls


Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt
Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand


So God made girls, God made girls
He stood back and told the boys, I'm 'bout to rock your world
And God made girls (for singing in your front seat)
God made girls (for dancin' to our own beat)
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
And God made girls


Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt
Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand


So God made girls


I keep telling myself this is the right thing to do
I was wasting her time, waiting on dreams that just weren't coming true
And this old highway seems to understand
Leading me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doing all that I can to get my mind off us


What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on


Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep
Now the sun's going down on my broken heart
Lord, I got to get back before I get too far


What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on
Yes I drive on, and on, and on


Knowing what I need to do
Girl, I'm coming home to you


Knowing what I need to do
Girl I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
Knowing what I need to do

If you were the ocean and I was the sun
If the day made me heavy and gravity won
If I was the red and you were the blue
I could just fade into you
If you were a window and I was the rain
I’d pour myself out and wash off the pain
I’d fall like a tear so your light could shine through
Then I’d just fade into you

In your heart in your head in your
Arms in your bed under your skin

Til there’s no way to know where
You end and where I begin

If I was a shadow and you were a
Street

The cobblestone midnight is where
We first meet

Til the lights flickered out, we
Dance with the moon

Then I’d just fade into you

In your heart in your head in your
Arms in your bed under your skin

Til there’s no way to know where
You end and where I begin

I wanna melt in I wanna soak through
I only wanna move when you move

I wanna breathe out when you
Breathe in then I wanna fade into you

If I was just ashes and you were
The ground

And under your willow they laid me
Down

There’ll be no trace that one was
Once two

After I fade into you

(Ooooh)

Then I’d just fade into you
Then I'd just fade into you
Then I'd just fade into you
Then I'd just fade into you


It took me 5 bars, some 30 license plates
I saw her mustang
And my eyes filled up with rage
I brought my pistol but I ain't some kinda fool
So I walked right in barehanded
She was on his arm while he was playing pool
Just like I used to do
She kissed him while I got a beer
She didn't think I'd show up here
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend


I watched her for awhile but I didn't like her walk
She came across kinda cheap to me
But hey how's that my fault
She looked at my man like he didn't have on a stitch
Somebody tell that girl
To step up to that plate
I wanna pitch
Little bitch


Well those pretty girls can play their game
But they're damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
Hey


Well I started throwing things and
I scared folks half to death
I got up in his face and smelled whiskey on his breath
I didn't give it a second thought to being thrown in jail
Well baby to a hammer everything looks like a nail
And I was mad as hell


Well those pretty girls can play their game
But they're damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend


I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend

Bust open the window, rip down the blinds
I'm sick of hiding from the sweet sunshine
Cause it ain't, ain't getting me nowhere

I've been locked up in this house for way too long, yeah
I'm sitting around singing sad, sad songs
And it ain't, ain't getting me nowhere

Chorus:
It's been a long time coming
I'm jumping off this reckless pity train
I'm all cashed out on your lovin'
I've paid my dues honey, you can keep the change

I know how to nurse a bad heartache and
I can make it worse when I want to feel the pain
But it ain't, ain't getting me nowhere

I know how to cry a river, I know how to drown
Put that anchor 'round my ankles and let it take me down
But it ain't, ain't getting me nowhere

Repeat Chorus

Keep the change, keep the change
Keep the change, keep the change

Repeat Chorus

I've paid my dues honey, you can keep the change


When I look up from the bottom
I still don't see the light
I feel like my whole world
Is stuck in the darkest night
There's a million different questions
That my mind's running through
And I don't know exactly what to do


I pray, I get down on my knees and drift away
He covers me with his amazing grace
When I need it, he fills that empty space
And it always seems to take the hurt away
When I pray

When I'm searching for the answer
But I can't find the truth
And I'm ready just to give up
Give in and just be through
I lift my eyes towards heaven
And I see it loud and clear
Everything I'm looking for is just right here






I pray, I get down on my knees and drift away
He covers me with his amazing grace
When I need it, he fills that empty space
And it always seems to take the hurt away
And he's never really ever far away
When I pray
I pray, I get down on my knees and drift away
He covers me with his amazing grace
When I need it, he fills that empty space
And it always seems to take the hurt away
And he's never really ever far away
When I pray




When I pray
When I pray


Excuse me ma'am, I saw you walking
I turned around, I'm not a stalker
Where you going? Maybe I can help you
My tank is full, I'd be obliged to take you


Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you need to go
Cause I'm a country boy


You sure look good sitting in my right seat
Buckle up and I'll take you through the five speeds
Wind it up or I can slow it way down
In the woods or right up town


I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
Yeah I can get you where you need to go
Cause I'm a country boy


Big thirty-fives, whining on the asphalt
Grabbing mud and slinging up some red dirt
Cause I'm a country boy
My mufflers loud, dual thrust tubes
Crank the music and the tone gets real good
Let me know when we're getting close
You can slide on out or we can head on down the road


Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you want to go
Cause I'm a country boy


Bucket seats, soft as babies nude butt
Locking hubs to take you through a deep rut


Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down winding roads
Yeah I can get you where you need to go
Cause I'm a country boy

Yeah, I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you want to go
Cause I'm a country boy, yeah, I'm a country boy
Ah, I'm just a country boy, a nice little country boy


I hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow
And each road leads you where you want to go
And if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walkin' till you find the window
If it's cold outside...
Show the world the warmth of your smile;
But more than anything...more than anything...


My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to--
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too...
Yeah, this is my wish


I hope you never look back, but you never forget
All the ones who love you, in the place you left
I hope you always forgive, and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you find God's grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything...
Yeah, more than anything..


My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to--
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too...
Yeah, this is my wish


I hope you know somebody loves you
May all your dreams stay big


Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through

Yellow sunset slowly dipping down in the rear view
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked and maked her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more that.. maybe I...


Wouldn't be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...
She wouldn't be gone.. she wouldn't be gone..


She warned me it was coming said if I didn't change
She was leaving
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out
God, I believe her now
Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend
If they've seen her, they ain't sayin', they ain't sayin'...
Now, I'm cursing like a fool, praying it ain't too late
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes


Find her beg her for one more try, until then damn it I"ll..
Be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...
She wouldn't be gone..


I wouldn't be beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...
She wouldn't be gone..

Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter, oh at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through...

TAKE A LETTER MARIA

Last night as I got home about a half past ten
There was the woman I thought I knew
In the arms of another man
I kept my cool, I ain't no fool
Let me tell you what happened then
I packed some clothes and I walked out
And I ain't going back again

So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gonna start a new life
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta start a new life

You've been many things but most of all a good secretary to me
And it's times like this I feel you've always been close to me
Was I wrong to work nights to try to build a good life
All work and no play has just cost me a wife

So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gonna start a new life
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta start a new life

When a man loves a woman it's hard to understand
That she would find more pleasure in the arms of another man
I never really noticed how sweet you are to me
It just so happens I'm free tonight
Would you like to have dinner with me

So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gonna start a new life
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta start a new life

So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta start a new life


I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you


Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years


I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear


Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtain room and this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years


What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?


Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years


I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

Jimmy was waitin' on Shelby Jean
In the parking lot at the Dairy Queen
He knew she's gonna be there soon
Then they'll blow this town just like a cheap balloon
She came in cryin' this morning at the store
Said "I swear Jimmy I just can't take no more"
So he quit his job and drew his pay
Now he's helpin' Shelby make her getaway
Oh... sittin' on go
Waitin' on sundown
Waitin' on sundown
No more beatin' to be denied
No more bruises that makeup can't hide
All these years she tried to love that man
But all he ever gave her was the back of his hand
Now Jimmy is a young boy just out of his teens
So many things that he still hasn't seen
But he's old enough to know wrong from right
That's why he's helpin' Shelby make a break tonight
And oh... sittin' on go
Waitin' on sundown
Waitin' on sundown
Waitin' on sundown
Drove all night, drove all day
Jimmy listened to everything Shelby had to say
How she'd suffered at her lover's hand
He said honey, I wanna change all that if I can
They pulled over to take a little rest
Shelby put her head down on Jimmy's chest
And she could hear the beatin' of his heart
And it sounded like the rhythm of a brand new start
And oh, she's gonna let him know
She's waitin' on sundown
She's just waitin' on sundown
They're waitin' on sundown
Waitin' on sundown

Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good to sit around and cry
That's just wasted time

Cause I know it ain't right
Yeah I know it ain't right
To sit around all night and let your memory
Get the best of me

I could dig a hole and crawl inside
Where the hurt won't show and the sun won't shine

But that won't help my heart to heal
Or take away this pain I feel
Lord knows I'd keep digging if it would
But it

Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good at all

Well I'm thinking I might
Yeah you know I just might
Get out tonight and tear up this old town
Burn Mr.A down
I could drown myself in misery
Swallow all that's left of you and me

But that won't help me say goodbye
To all these long and lonely nights
Wash 'em down with whiskey if it would
But it

Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good at all

Oh I could roll I know
Tryin' to let you go
Come on

Don't do me no don't don't don't
Don't do me no don't don't don't
Don't do me no good at all

Don't do me no don't don't don't
Don't do me no don't don't don't
Don't do me no good at all

Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good at all

Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good at all

She gets up every mornin' while everyone's in bed
Starts the coffee, makes the breakfast for all those sleepy-heads
Yeah, yeah, some things never change

He comes in all dressed for work sayin', "Baby, I love you"
Gotta go, even though it's not what he wants to do
But he does it, some things never change

In a world that keeps turnin' and movin' so fast
When you can't hold on to nothin' and nothin' seems to last
It's so good to know that love still remains
Ain't you glad that some things never change?

Three o'clock every afternoon waitin' by the door
Sees her babies are runnin' off the bus, she couldn't love 'em any more
Yeah, yeah, oh, some things never change

Like when I'm lyin' next to you, well, I remember when
Your kisses made me crazy so beautiful back then
And I still feel the same, yeah, some things never change

In a world that keeps turnin' and movin' so fast
When you can't hold on to nothin' and nothin' seems to last
It's so good to know that love still remains
Ain't you glad that some things never change?

Yeah, same as the sun keeps risin'
Yeah, every day someone is findin' love
Oh yeah

In a world that keeps turnin' and movin' so fast
When you can't hold on to nothin' and nothin' seems to last
It's so good to know that love still remains

Oh, when the world that keeps turnin' and movin' so fast
When you can't hold on to nothin' and nothin' seems to last
And it's sure good to know that love still remains
Oh, ain't you glad that some things never change? Yeah
Oh, ain't you glad that some things never change?
Ooh, oh, some things never change

I remember Daddy held the Bible like a gun
Back when I was a Pentacostal gospel preacher's son
And I still can see the fire and brimstone in his eyes
When he preached to people in a tent
Repent before you die

Pre Chorus

Me, I'd sneak out back with some saint-less, Southern girl
And there I'd teach her the ways of this world

Chorus

(Well) I guess I was 'a way too wild
To be the child of a preacher man
One foot on a solid rock
(And) (With) one on (the) (that) sinkin' sand
Just like the prodigal son
I guess I got way too lost
Livin' somewhere in between the devil and the cross
(Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa ho)

2nd Verse

I was Daddy's worst nightmare
By the time I turned eighteen
Baptized in a whiskey river
On the streets of New Orleans
Where the demons, drugs, and rock and roll
They seemed to clog my mind
And women were a weakness
For weeks at a time

Pre Chorus

I learned the hard way
What you reap is what you sew
So in silent desperation
One night I headed home

(Repeat Chorus)
Bridge

Daddy did more than talk the talk
He walked the walk in life
He loved me and forgave me
When I came home that night
He said, 'Son, don't ever be ashamed
For God forgives the lost


Forever can never be long enough for me
To feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now we won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do
Now that the weight has lifted
Love has surely shifted my way


Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this caffe
Say you will
Mm-hmm
Say you will
Mm-hmm


Together could never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You'll wear white and I'll wear out the words "I love you"
And "you're beautiful"
Now that the wait is over
And love and has finally shown her my way




Promise me
You'll always be
Happy by my side
I promise to
Sing to you
When all the music dies



{Outro-both}
Say you will
I will
Say you will
I will


Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up


Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it


Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now


Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it


Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it


All he could think about was I'm too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell, I'm just a kid myself
How am I going to raise one

All he could see were his dreams going up in smoke
So much for ditching this town
And hanging out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone


And he said
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all good-bye
There goes my life


A couple years of up all night
And a few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah, he loves that little girl

Momma's waiting to tuck her in
As she fumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him
Dragging that teddy bear
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls


He smiles
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you, daddy good-night
There goes my life


She had that Honda loaded down
With Abercrombie clothes and 15 pairs of shoes
And his American Express
He checked the oil and slammed the hood
Said you're good to go
She hugged them both and headed off to the West Coast


And he cried
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you
Baby, good-bye


There goes my life
There goes my life
Baby good-bye


Country roads, old theater marquee signs
Parking lots, and billboards flying by
Spanish moss, little hick town squares
Wild roses on a river bank
Girl its almost like you're there


Oh, every mile, a memory
Every song, another scene
From some old movie going back in time you and me
Every day, a page turned down
Every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rolling through my dreams
Every mile, a memory


Red sun down, out across the western sky
Takes me back to the fire in your eyes
Texas stars in a purple night
Not seeing 'em with you baby
Oh, they never do it right, no


Eevery mile, a memory
Every song, another scene
From some old movie going back in time you and me
Every day, a page turned down
Every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rolling through my dreams
Every mile, a memory


Funny how no matter where I run
Round every bend I only see
Just how far I haven't come


Every mile, a memory
Every song, another scene
From some old movie going back in time you and me
Every day, a page turned down
Every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rolling through my dreams
And every mile, a memory
Every mile, a memory
Every mile, a memory

Well, i had a buddy back in '81
And we made ourselves a pact
We were headin' for the new pipeline
We were never comin' back
Well we worked 80 hours making time and a half
But La Grange was too damn hot
We drove back home at the end of that week
And we spent it all on pot

Chorus:
So I'll see you in Houston
If I ever get out that way
I'll see you in dallas
But I won't have long to stay
If ur ever out west son
And ur feeling like slowing down
I'll see you around
Around my hometown

Well, I played ball every single fall
I could run just like the wind
Went to college like they asked me too
But they didn't ask my friends
Don't think I seen a single classroom
But I drank a lot of beer
My buddies still love to listen to me when I talk about that year

Chorus:
Now I got myself a little band
And we're pretty good I guess
But I never learned how to wear my hair
And I never learned how to dress
So I'm leaving for the last time honey
I'm never more wrong
Gonna pack my bags a little heavy this time gonna head my ass back home

So I'll see you in Nashville
If I ever get out that way
I'll see you in Austin
But I won't have long to stay
If ur ever out west son
And youre feeling like slowin down
I'll see you around
Around my hometown
I'll see you around
Around my hometown

In my high school we separate the rich from the rest
Those who wear rags from those who only wear the best
And in my high school they hold assemblies for the football team
But never for the kids with different dreams

We've got jocks, we've got smokers, rednecks and jokers
There's a catagory for us all
And we struggle with our homework, our teachers and their rules
Yeah, they think we're just adolescent fools

In my high school there's some who think they're tought as they can be
But when I look in their eyes all I see is insecurity
And in my high school there's who'll wait and then there's some who won't
Some who cross those lines and some that don't

We've got outcasts, we've got rebels, mostly saint's, sometimes devils
You see them walking up and down the hall
And they struggle with their boyfriends, their girlfriends, and their math
And they long for the bell that gets them out of class... in my high school

We laugh, we cry, we fall, we fly
And sometimes we wonder why we're even hear
We pass, we fail, and only time will tell
If we'll ever make it through these teenage years

In my high school there's some who study for their entrance exams
Some who just want to play guitar in some rock and roll band
And in my high school the seniors just cannot wait for June
But they don't realize that we grow up way too soon
They'll be doctors, they'll be lawyers, teachers and warriors
They'll live out their dreams big and small
And they'll struggle with their jobs, their husbands, and their wives
And they'll talk about the best days of their lives... In my high school

In my high school
In my high school
In my high school


I haven't been myself these days according to friends
I tend to lose a part of me when my heart is on the mend
I'll be alright it's safe to say
'Cause just like your love, this is only a phase


Well, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
Well, I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just going through a little downtime


Some might think I've gotten caught up in heartache's aftermath
But your memory's taken second to a good book and nice long bath
I must admit it threw me at first
But I'm convinced I'm over the worst


Oh, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
Oh, I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just going through a little downtime


Well, time is meant to play the part
In taking care of broken hearts


Oh, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just going through a little
Oh, I'm just going through a little
I'm just going through a little downtime


Another new city, another new town
Making new memories
Making each moment count
My new favorite place is where I've never been
But there's one place I go back again and again and again


Hold on, hold on, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
It's been too long, way too long
So I'm coming home to you


Can't help but smile when the plane touches down
Knowing that I'll see a face in the crowd
We'll talk for hours and the world fades away
I live for these moments
My heart it counts down the days


Hold on, hold on, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
It's been too long, way too long
So I'm coming home to you


Always come home to you
Your love is what gets me through
All these days and nights
Quick goodbyes, crazy life
Everything changes but you


Hold on, hold on, I'm coming home
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming home
It's been too long
Way too long
So I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you


I can taste your kiss on my lips
And I'm wrapped around your finger tips
As I watch the moonlight dancing on your skin
Your green eyes and the sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
And I get drunk on you
I lose control and then
And here I go again


I'm falling for you even though I know your only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you’re gone


Girl I know you're a gypsy soul
And I'm just a stop along your road
And you hang around long enough to blow my mind
If I had a star for every scar
You tattooed on my heart
I could fill up the Oklahoma sky
So girl I don't know why


I'm falling for you even though I know your only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you’re gone

I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Till you’re gone


I look down and my cell phone rings
And I see your name and I know what that means
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till your gone

Every time you need to take it home?
Seeing you there just breaks my heart?
I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you’re gone

Your green eyes and that sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you’re gone


Go ahead and tell me that you never really loved me, baby
Go ahead and tell me that the things I do have always made you crazy


Don't worry, darlin'
Don't worry, darlin', that's okay
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway


Go ahead and let it fall to pieces, tell me I've been blind
Maybe if I'd only seen it comin' I'd have found a way to change your mind


Don't worry, darlin'
Don't worry, darlin', that's okay
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway


I'm gonna love you
In spite of it all
Drop everything, baby
Run when you call
You're gonna stumble
You're gonna fall
And I'll be there
I'll be there for you


Go ahead and tell me that you're sorry
No one else could take my place
I know that's what you're thinkin'
I can see it by the way it's written on your face


Don't worry, darlin'
Don't worry, darlin', that's okay
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway


Go ahead and tell me that you never really loved me, baby

He promised her a new and better life out in Arizona
Underneath the blue never ending sky
Swore that he was gonna
Get things in order
He'd send for her
When he left her behind
It never crossed her mind

There is no Arizona
No Painted Desert, no Sedona
If there was a Grand Canyon
She could fill it up with the lies he's told her
But they don't exist, those dreams he sold her
She'll wake up and find
There is no Arizona

She got a postcard with no return address, postmarked Tombstone
It said "I don't know where I'm goin' next but when I do
I'll let you know"
May, June, July, she wonders why
She's still waiting, she'll keep waiting cause

There is no Arizona
No Painted Desert, no Sedona
If there was a Grand Canyon
She could fill it up with the lies he's told her
But they don't exist, those dreams he sold her
She'll wake up and find
There is no Arizona

Each day the sun sets into the west
Her heart sinks lower in her chest and
Friends keep asking when she's going
Finally she tells them don't you know

There is no Arizona
No Painted Desert, no Sedona
If there was a Grand Canyon
She could fill it up with the lies he's told her
But they don't exist, those dreams he sold her
She'll wake up and find
There is no Arizona

He promised her a new and better life
Out in Arizona


Plowing these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate lordy here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face she ain’t a fooling me


She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chugging along
She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy


We ride back and forth 'til we run out of light
Take it to the barn put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft sit and talk with the radio on
She said she's got a dream and I asked what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
One more teeny weenie ride before take her home


She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chugging along
She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy


Well, she isn’t into cars or pickup trucks
But if it runs like a Deere, man, her eyes light up


She thinks my tractor's
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chugging along
She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy

Hey, you were standing by the screen door slamming
Rather clear what's taking place
You were holding onto Louie
He was packin', he was heavy
That plastic handle just about to break
Well then you picked up Chloe
She knew y'all were going
She started barking like a tank
I was shocked and I was joking
But I will not be lonely
Cause I got Jim and Jack and Hank

Take your string bikinis, your apple martinis
Take what's left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes, all that stuff for ladies
To me you're just a total blank
Go on and leave me baby, I don't need you
I got Jim and Jack and Hank

Well now you left screaming and your tires screeching
That little dog right in your lap
I became a little sad and called up my ol' dad
He said, "Son you just woke me from my nap"
I told him you had left me
He said, "Son now don't you hate me
You know exactly what I think
You know you're better off, you can fish and you can golf
You still got Jim and Jack and Hank"

Take your string bikinis, your apple martinis
Take what's left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes, all that stuff for ladies
To me you're just a total blank
Go on and leave me baby, I don't need you
I got Jim and Jack and Hank, that's right

So I got out the whiskey and I began to listen to the songs
Out in my truck you couldn't crank
I started feeling empty, then again it hit me
I've got Jim and Jack and Hank

Take your string bikinis, your apple martinis
Take what's left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes, all that stuff for ladies
To me you're just a total blank
Go on and leave me baby, I don't need you
I got Jim and Jack and Hank

Yeah now, go on and leave me baby
I don't need you
I got Jim and Jack and Hank

That's right, you go ahead, I'll be A-OK, cause I got Jose
Captain Morgan, not to mention ol' Old George and Tammy
And Loretta, Merle, Willie Nelson, Big John Cash
How about old Jimmy Buffett?
Bring him in there when that sun's shining
George Strait, an old friend
Can't forget Hank Jr. and all his rowdy friends
I'm gonna clean out the whole closet baby
Oh yeah
Goodbye

She burns too hot, plays too rough
She's got a dress full of dangerous stuff
The way she looks, tears me apart, but the way she loves me nearly stops my heart

If the lovin' don't kill me, don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill
If the lovin' don't kill me then nothin' will

My doctor told me I looked kinda' ragged
He said "What happened, John, did ya' fall off the wagon?"
I said it ain't my drinking or my smokin', Doc
It's just that drop-dead woman rockin' me around the clock

If the lovin' don't kill me, don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill
If the lovin' don't kill me then nothin' will

Every night, she tears me up, she gives it good and I can't get enough
And if the lovin' don't kill me; don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill
If the lovin' don't kill me then nothin' will

If the lovin' don't kill me, don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill
If the lovin' don't kill me then nothin' will
If the lovin' don't kill me, If the lovin' don't kill me; If the lovin' don't kill me

Nothin' will, nothin' will

If the lovin' don't kill me, nothin' will


Put your phone away
I know you want to check it
This is one of those nights
And I don't want to wreck it
With distractions and worries
'Bout what all could go wrong tomorrow
So live in this moment
And know that there's no time to borrow


It's a crazy, crazy world out there
But baby, baby don't be scared
Cause I got you and you got me
We can set each other free
One day, one day when we're old
We'll look back, look back
And we'll know
We always kept our dreams alive
Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light
Singin' long live tonight
Singin' long live tonight


I know an old spot
It ain't that cool
But they got a little dance floor
We can act like fools
We'll ask the DJ to play every song from the 90s
We'll tear it up 'til the sun starts to rise and it's blinding


It's a crazy, crazy world out there
But baby, baby don't be scared
Cause I got you and you got me
We can set each other free
One day, one day when we're old
We'll look back, look back
And we'll know
We always kept our dreams alive
Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light
Singin' long live tonight
Singin' long live tonight


Long live, long live
Tonight, tonight
Long live, long live
Tonight, tonight


It's a crazy, crazy world out there
But baby, baby don't be scared
Cause I got you and you got me
We can set each other free
One day, one day when we're old
We'll look back, look back
And we'll know
We always kept our dreams alive
Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light
Singin' long live tonight
Singin' long live tonight


Mudgrips, white-tip, cigar stickin' out of my face
Earnhardt racin' sticker, on the window, banged up fender
4x4, straight-pipe roar, primer and rust all over the door
Scarred up knuckles, Mack belt buckle, white t-shirt, ain't afraid to work
Got a "what-are-you-lookin'-at-asshole?" smirk


Cold beer, hot wings, wranglers, Skoal ring
Get just what you see
Gun rack, ball cap, don't take no crap
Ain't a pretty boy-toy, I'll rock you steady
Rough and ready


Work boots, one blue suit, size too small, won't wear it at all
Unless somebody kicks, gets hitched, that's a bitch, it makes me itch
Up with sun, off on the run, makin' money, money, 'cause I wanna have fun
5 o'clock whistle, off like a missile, got a hot date, girl named Kate
Thinks I'm cool, 'cause I shoot straight, ain't one thing about her fake
She's long and tall, and she goes great with


Cold beer, hot wings, wranglers, Skoal ring
Get just what you see
Gun rack, ball cap, don't take no crap
Ain't a pretty boy-toy, I'll rock you steady
Rough and ready
Rough and ready


Well you are who you are
And that's all right with me
Well I am who I am
And that's all I can be, I like...


Cold beer, hot wings, wranglers, Skoal ring
Get just what you see
Gun rack, ball cap, don't take no crap
Ain't a pretty boy-toy, I'll rock you steady
Rough and ready


Rough and ready
Rough and ready, baby
Aw, that's me and my buddies are all alike

I, I been gone I been gone too long singing my songs on the road
Another town one more show and I'm coming home
Don't give a damn what these keys I hold I'm gonna knock down that front door, and

I'ma find out what that house is made of
It's been too many nights since its felt us make love
I wanna rock some Sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby, like a wrecking ball

You... look at you send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink
Damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink
Easy baby before you say but if I can make it just one more day, and

That old house is gonna be shaking
I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls
I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ball

And that old house is gonna be shaking
Rafter and rocking foundation quaking
Crash right through the front door, back you up against the wall
Love you baby take it right there baby rock you baby, like a wrecking ball


Don't give me that look, that let me down easy smile
Don't act like I couldn't see you coming for a hundred miles
Don't try to find the perfect words
Can't take the pain out of the hurt
Hit me hard, baby I can take it
It's your move, go on and make it


Make it burn the whole way down
Lay my 6 foot 4 inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow I'll have me a hard hangover
And one hell of a heartache
So pour it on like a shot of whiskey
And shoot me straight


I’ve got some friends who'd love to go raise some hell
A couple old flames to help me bid you farewell
There's plenty of time and alcohol
From happy hour, to last call
So do what'cha gotta do
So I can get to getting over you


Make it burn the whole way down
Lay my 6 foot 4 inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow I'll have me a hard hangover
And one hell of a heartache
So pour it on like a shot of whiskey
And shoot me straight


Don't give me that salt shaker and lime
Don't give me that come back chaser this time
Don't muddle it up, don't water it down
Give me everything you got right here, right now
Make it burn


Make it burn the whole way down
Lay my 6 foot 4 inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow I'll have me a hard hangover
And one hell of a heartache
Pour it on like a shot of whiskey
And shoot me straight

Shoot me straight
Come on




I still walk in that bar a little drunk
I still ask you what you're drinking, what's your name
I still kiss you by the shuffleboard, last call at 2am
Even though we break up in the end


I'll introduce you to my mom and dad
Say "I think I love her" when you leave that room
I'd still not take their advice when I say you're moving in
Even though we break up in the end


Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Oh, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end


I'd still play my favorite song in your car
Let you love me to it, 'til it felt like ours
Now all I hear is you in it, but I'd still let you ruin it
Even though we break up in the end


Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Girl, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end


You've just had one too many tonight
You're just calling 'cause you're lonely, that's okay
But you know if you come over, I can't not let you in
Even though we'll break up in the end
I'd do it over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end


Hugged your friends
Kissed your mama goodbye
Baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
Twelve hundred miles and you never asked why from me
Me and the baby and you side by side
We all knew we was in for a long hard ride
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide it seemed
We honked the horn when we crossed the state line
Woke up the baby and she started to cry
She must have known what we were going to find


This ain't nothing but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancing
Without the sound
It ain't nothing no nothing
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're going to climb
Pat on the back 'n' better luck next time
It ain't nothing no it ain't nothing but a heartbreak town


Stardust well it's a funny thing
It can make you cuss
It can make you sing
And the need to touch it gets hard to explain some days
I've seen them rise
I've seen them fall
Some get nothing
And Lord some get it all
Some just run
While others crawl away
Hold my hand baby don't let go
I've got some front money
And I've got a next show
And I'm going to need you
Down this yellow brick road


This ain't nothing but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancing
Without the sound
It ain't nothing no nothing
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're going to climb
Pat on the back 'n' better luck next time
It ain't nothing no it ain't nothing but a heartbreak town

All the leaves have turned to rust
The air is getting thin
I can see my breath
The night is rolling in

The sky is grey
It's cold as a stone
It's just the kind of day
I can't stand to be alone

Cause you, you've been on my mind
And I wish you were here
Beside me tonight lying in this bed
Cause I, I'm just not the same
I walk down these streets; I swear I hear your name
But it's just in my head
I wish you were in my arms instead

I wasn't thinking about you
When I thought I saw your car
I can't escape you for long
You know I never get too far

You're everywhere I go
Cause you're everywhere I've been
You're everything I've wanted
And I want you back again

Cause you, you've been on my mind
And I wish you were here
Beside me tonight lying in this bed
Cause I, I'm just not the same
I walk down these streets; I swear I hear your name
But it's just in my head
I wish you were in my arms instead

I have to find a way, That's just how it is
I'm stuck here in this place

Cause you, you've been on my mind
And I wish you were here
Beside me tonight lying in this bed
Cause I, I'm just not the same
I walk down these streets; I swear I hear your name
But it's just in my head

My ol' man was a contradiction
A real hard man to figure
He'd read the King James Bible
While sippin' on corn liquor
He'd get drunk, and he'd get to preachin'
Right out on the porch
Alternatin' between cussin' and a prayin'
Spittin' and a praisin' the Lord
No doubt about it
He was a man of both extremes
He had his share of demons
But on Jesus he would lean

(Chorus:)
He'd say, "Fly high like the angels
Run wild like the devil
We're all tryin' to find the middle
Between saint and sinner, wrong and right
Sunday morning and saturday night. "
Well, I have sung "Amazing Grace," hymnal in my hand
Played "Stairway To Heaven" in a three piece pick up band
I know the straight and narrow is the path that I should take
But out here in the fast lane, you tend to get a little sideways
I still hear him preachin'
Slurrin' his words a bit
Sayin' the thing about temptation
Is it's so hard to resist


Back then I didn't realize
The wisdom in the sermon
It took a while to understand
The lesson I'm still learnin'


Saint and sinner, wrong and right
Sunday morning and Saturday night
He said, "Fly high like the angels."


Going out of my mind these days
Like I'm walking 'round in a haze
I can't think straight, I can't concentrate
And I need a shave


I go to work and I look tired
The boss man says, "Son you're gonna get fired
This ain't your style", and from behind my coffee cup
I just smile


What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Ahhh


This morning put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
I'm losing my mind, I swear; it might be the death of me
But I don't care


What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Ahhh


Is it your eyes is it your smile
All I know is that you're driving me wild


What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
(What a beautiful)
What a beautiful...


What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Ahhh
Ahhh

I wake up to find myself
After all these years
And where all the time has gone
Still seems so unclear
Cause there's no one else
Since I found you
I know it's been so hard
You should know

If I die tomorrow
As the minutes fade away
I can't remember
Have I said all I can say?
You're my everything
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow

It brings out the worst in me
When you're not around
I miss the sound of your voice
The silence seems so loud
Cause there's no one else
Since I found you
I know it's been so hard
You should know

If I die tomorrow
As the minutes fade away
I can't remember
Have I said all I can say?
You're my everything
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow

I spent all my life
Looking for our innocence
I've got nothing to lose
One thing to prove
I won't make the same mistakes
Now I know
That everything will be ok
When I die tomorrow

If I die tomorrow
As the minutes fade away
I can't remember
Have I said all I can say?
You're my everything
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow
If I die tomorrow


The trouble with girls is they’re a mystery
Something about ’em puzzles me
Spent my whole life trying to figure out
Just what them girls are all about
The trouble with girls is they're so dang pretty
Everything about ’em does something to me
But I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be


They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with "hello"
They kill you with "goodbye"
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me


They’re sugar and spice and angel wings
And hell on wheels and tight blue jeans
A summer night, down by the lake
An old memory that you can’t shake
They’re hard to find, yet there’s so many of ’em
The way that you hate, that you already love ’em
But I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be


They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with "hello"
They kill you with "goodbye"
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me


The way they hold you out on the dance floor
The way they ride in the middle of your truck
The way they give you a kiss at the front door
Leave you wishing you could have gone up
And just as you walk away
You hear that sweet voice say…
Stay


They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with "hello"
They kill you with "goodbye"
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me


They wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishing hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work, all week til the job gets done
Weekends they bar-b-que and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll


Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll


Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll


Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll


Aw come on now
Yeah they're crying aloud
Humble and proud
They love moma and Jesus and Jones
That's how country boys roll
Don't you know

She's got that certain thing about her
Sometimes it drops me to my knees
Sometimes it makes it hard to love her
But I always come around and see

Chorus:
Hey lady, I'm nothin' without you
Hey baby, you're nothin' without me
We got it constantly

One look from her eyes gets me thinkin'
What the hell could I have done this time
But it's love that I mistake for anger

The woman drives me outta my mind

(Repeat Chorus)
Can't wrap my mind around her leavin'
If she did they'd surely find me gone
Tons of heartache upon piles of grieving
Not a chance in hell I could carry on

(Repeat Chorus)
She's got that certain thing about her

Here we go
Uh, ha ha
Yeah

I don't wanna be your Monday morning, heading back to work
Stuck in traffic going slow, nothing on the radio
I don't wanna be another chore to check off on your list
Things you gotta do, places that you gotta go
Oh, no

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free, I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night
Oh, your Friday night

We can rock together, let the good times roll forever
Fill up our cup, make a memory, drink it up
I don't wanna miss another minute, wanna live it with you
Neath the blue sky falling in love

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free, I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night
Oh, your Friday night

One, two, three, four

I wanna be your lemonade in the shade
Money in your pocket cause you just got paid, babe

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free, I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night
Oh, your Friday night
Hey, your Friday night
Hey, your Friday night
Oh, F-F-F-Friday night

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of Pauseping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!


Mm, yeah, yeah-eh-eah


I was born off an old dirt road forty acre farm
No highway, no interstate
And I drive an old rusted out Chevrolet
The boys all rubberneck while their out makin' hay


Hey, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah


There's a little cotton dress hangin' in my sisters closet
I think I'm gonna borrow it and wear it this weekend
Painted my toes, bought some cherry lip gloss
No rose, no daisy, can touch what I got


Yeah, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah


I'm just a girl who needs a little sun, a little rain
An open field to play


Hey, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower

I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower


Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I'm a wildflower
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I'm a wildflower
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I'm a wildflower

It was one of those days when she couldn't find a single ray of sunshine
There wasn't even a cloud up in the sky
After thirteen years at the factory they sorry mam but we're downsizin
That's the way life is, good luck with the rest of it
She looked me in the eye and said this ain't the first time I've taken the fall
But let me tell you girl what's gotten me through is keepin faith through it all

Cause there'll be
Dead ends and road blocks, Tough times and hard knocks
Seems like you're always wonderin why you're at the right place at the wrong time
Wheels movin but you feel stuck, like your life's spinnin in a big mud
When you're out there runnin around on a wild goose chase
There's a reason to keep believin
God don't make mistakes

Everybody said you gotta give it up
You can't keep that child, It's just too tough at seventeen, You're just a baby
Well she cried and she prayed, made up her mind
Said this beautiful life that's growin inside needs a chance to have a hand in God's plan
Everyone told her they'd never by, well he just turned sixteen
Made it straight to the top of his class, the captain of the football team

Yeah, there'll be
Dead ends and road blocks, Tough times and hard knocks
Seems like you're always wonderin why you're at the right place at the wrong time
Wheels movin but you feel stuck, like your life's spinnin in a big mud
When you're out there runnin around on a wild goose chase
There's a reason to keep believin
God don't make mistakes

Oh, there'll be
Dead ends and road blocks, Tough times and hard knocks
Seems like you're always wonderin why you're at the right place at the wrong time
Wheels movin but you feel stuck, like your life's spinnin in a big mud
When you're out there runnin around on a wild goose chase
There's a reason to keep believin
Keep believin!
God don't make mistakes!

Yeah, yeah
Oh, God don't make mistakes!


Just a Monday, thrift shop couch
Bowl of Cheerios, it's getting dark out
Clicking my remote to an episode
Of Crazy Housewives
And before you know
I see your face on my screen
That ringtone can only mean
Your friends are gone
You're all alone
And you're thinkin' 'bout me


I used to be your "6 a.m
Hey good morning
Beautiful, how you been?"
I used to be a "we just landed
Miss you, you can't stand it
See you this weekend"
Now I'm just a midnight number
Familiar voice
When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice
So let it ring, let it ring all night long
'Cause I ain't your lonely call


It's been three weeks and two days
And twelve hours, but who's counting
Ten thousand tears, feels like a year
Looking for some peace, and I found it
'Cause boy you said, "Let's take a break"
In the front seat of your Jeep
So if you got more to say
Leave a message at the beep


I used to be your "6 a.m
Hey good morning
Beautiful, how you been?"
I used to be a "we just landed
Miss you, you can't stand it
See you this weekend"
Now I'm just a midnight number
Familiar voice
When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice
So let it ring, let it ring all night long
'Cause I ain't your lonely call
I ain't your lonely call, call, oh


Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring


I used to be your "6 a.m
Hey good morning
Beautiful, how you been?"
I used to be a "we just landed
Miss you, you can't stand it
See you this weekend"
Now I'm just a midnight number
Familiar voice
When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice
So let it ring, let it ring all night long
'Cause I ain't your lonely call
I ain't your lonely call
No, I ain't your lonely call
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Love doesn't come with a contract
You give me this I gave you that
It's scary business
Your heart and soul is on the line
Baby why else would I be standing round here so tongue-tied


If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in, I'm in


Baby come on in the water's fine
I'll be right here you take your time
Just let me hold you and we'll both take that leap of faith
It's like I told you there's no guarantees when you feel this way


If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in


Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am


If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet's silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
Now if you need a lover and a friend
Now if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in


Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
Baby come here baby come here baby come here


I learned the hard way real early in life
That money sure don't grow on a tree
And there's a few things that a dollar can't buy
The best things in life, they come free


So girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Oh, but baby don't think I can't love you


And when I get home after working all day
I'm beat down girl, I'm dead on my feet
But as tired as I am if you want to play
Well, playing sounds real good to me



I can't count the barns I've passed
Painted red, white and black
See Rock City
And up ahead there's a turn
Takes me right through Gatlinburg
I hear its pretty
Maybe some other time, I can't slow down
Right across that state line, right about now

Her hair still wet from her bath
She's sitting on the front porch with a glass of iced tea
In my sweatshirt, in her bare feet, this I gotta see
If I hurry I can catch
The colors on her skin from that sunset
Her face and that look waitin' on me, this I gotta see

I can't wait to get to her, man
I wish I were there already
Shes the only thing that keeps this world from driving me crazy
I just hit that city limit
Yeah, that's a pretty good sign
And if I pick it up a bit, I'll be right on time

Her hair still wet from her bath
She's sitting on the front porch with a glass of iced tea
In my sweatshirt, in her bare feet, this I gotta see
If I hurry I can catch
The colors on her skin from that sunset
Her face and that look waitin' on me, this I gotta see


Well there ain't enough smoke in my eyes
To hide the kind of games you're trying to play
Honey, don't you act so surprised
You know exactly what I'm bout to say
You kiss my lips like you mean it, but you ain't that slick


Everywhere we go, you keep looking around
Fixing your make-up like it's about to go down
And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal, you
You don't want me, you just want your ex to see, ex to see


So that's why when I pick you up
You always want me to drive your car
So I can leave mine at your house
And he can wonder where you are
Well, you're right here looking sexy, whispering in my ear


Everywhere we go, you keep looking around
Fixing your make-up like it's about to go down
And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal you
You don't want me, you just want your ex to see, ex to see


Girl, you look kind of cute called out
You're making it hard to have hard feelings for you now
So hey, did he really do you wrong?
I guess I can play along, I guess I can play along


And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal you
Girl come here and kiss me, I just want your ex to see
I just want your ex to see, ex to see, ex to see


I just want your ex to see
Girl, you look kind of cute called out
I just, I just, I just want your ex to see
I just want your ex, I just want your ex
I-I just want your ex, I just want your ex to see


Roll in the bar, me and my crew
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookin’ me up, yeah
Buyin’ me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing


I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you


Don't know what you did, but you done it good
You don't know how bad that I wish I could
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home
But there's just one thing wrong


I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you


Your lips, your eyes
Girl, since you told me goodbye


I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you


Baby, I see you
Baby, I see you


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white


I should've known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes, and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide


Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face


You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it


Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na


Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name, and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw 'em in the trash
And I'm not even sad


Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
Oh no, you'll never change


You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it


Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na na


You want my future, you can't have it
I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast


You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it


You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Little white shoes, little white pearls
Little white lacy dress
Dirt on the cheek, skinned up knees
A pretty little muddy mess

Sittin' on the bank of the creek out back
After Sunday church
With a reel and a rod, daddy's tackle box
And a big ol' can of worms

Mama tried her very best

But daddy's little girl ain't all sugar
Daddy's little girl sure got spice
She'd rather be down in the dust and dirt
Playin' by her own rules

Fix her hair in curls and bows
She's still gonna play with the G.I. Joes
No pink Malibu Barbie toys
Daddy's little girl is a tomboy

She won't have time for paintin' her nails
Or Glamour Magazine
She'll have a four wheel drive, pickup truck
A subscription to Field and Stream

Torn up jeans and a baseball cap
With her head up under the hood
But Friday night when she lets her hair down
She sure does clean up good

All the guys will turn their heads

'Cause daddy's little girl ain't all sugar
Daddy's little girl sure got spice
She'd rather be down in the dust and dirt
Playin' by her own rules

Instead of shakin' those pom poms, kickin' up her heels
She'll be kickin' that football down the field
Come on, everybody make some noise
Daddy's little girl is a tomboy, yeah

Mama tried her very best

But daddy's little girl ain't all sugar
Daddy's little girl sure got spice
She'd rather be down in the dust and dirt
Playin' by her own rules

Instead of rockin' that baby doll in her arms
She'll be rockin' it out on the lead guitar
Come on, everybody make some noise
Daddy's little girl is a tomboy, yeah
I'm a tomboy
(Daddy's little girl is a tomboy)

She takes spinning class, she cooks low fat
Always passes on the butter pats
She's regimented resolute
Looks dang good in her birthday suit
She wishes I would walk the line
But most the time I don't
She treats her body like a temple
And I treat mine like a honky tonk

CHORUS
I cuss and smoke and tell bad jokes
And hang out with the band
The only exercise I get is curling 12 ounce cans
Her motto is just do it
Mine's do what you want
She treats her body like a temple
And I treat mine like a honky tonk

She never goes no where till she does her hair
And takes the time to find the perfect thing to wear
Me I'm out on the town
In day old Bermuda's with the zipper down
She smells like a field of flowers
And I smell like a swamp
She treats her body like a temple
And I treat mine like a honky tonk


Oh, you like the way that sounds?


Little Jimmy Jackson is jackinl up his Bronco
He's gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
And all the girls are gettin' pretty, they're sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah, they're gonna get a rowdy tonight down at the football game


Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown


Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailin' on his shingles
And his woman smokin' Pall Malls watchin' Laura Ingalls
And Granny's gettin' lit, she's headin' out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies and me are goin' muddin' down on Blue Hole Road

You know, you know


Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown


Oh, stand on it


We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio


We let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

Oh, oh


Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it's buckwild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown
In a hicktown
Yeah, it's the way we get down
Yeah, in hicktown
Yeah, in hicktown

Aw, we ain't finished yet


Got your country boys and your redneck girls
It's the party heard 'round the world
Right here in hicktown
In hicktown
The whole town's gettin' down


Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it's buckwild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown
In a hicktown
Yeah, it's the way we get down
Yeah, in hicktown
Yeah, in hicktown


Girl you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it


Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget


Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're get'in through


Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget (yeah)
Just what we came here to forget


Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're getting through


Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget


What we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
Baby, baby
That's what we came here to forget

I'm the son of a third generation farmer
I've been married ten years to the farmer's daughter
I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester

Three miles of cars layin' on their horns
Fallin' on deaf ears of corn
Lined up behind me like a big parade
Of late to work road raged jerks
Shoutin' obscene words
Flippin' me the bird

Well you may be on a state paved road
But that blacktop runs through my payload
Excuse me for tryin' to do my job
But this year ain't been no bumper crop

If you don't like the way I'm a drivin'
Get back on the interstate
Otherwise, sit tight and be nice
And quit your honkin' at me that way

I'm the son of a third generation farmer
I've been married ten years to the farmer's daughter
I've got two boys in the county 4-H
I'm a lifetime sponsor of the F.F.A

Hey!
That's a what I make
I make a lot of hay for a little pay
But I'm proud to say

I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester

Well I know you got your own deadlines
But cussin' at me won't save you no time, hoss
This big-wheeled wide load ain't goin' any faster
So just smile and wave and tip your hat
To the man up on the tractor

Cause I'm the son of a third generation farmer
I've been married ten years to the farmer's daughter
I've got two boys in the county 4-H
I'm a lifetime sponsor of the F.F.A

Hey!
That's a what I make
I make a lot of hay for a little pay
But I'm proud to say

I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester

I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester

I look at you and I remember
The way I felt on the day we met
That same old feeling washes over me
I't hard to forget
Nothing has ever changed for me babe
Nothing changes for you
I still want you just as much as i did
When I said "I do"

Chours
I'm still wrapped up in the ring around
You finger
Without you baby, I would be lost
I'm telling you the truth
I'm still as much in love with you as I
Always was
I'm a slave to your every desire
I worship the ground where you walk
I'm telling you the truth
I'm still as much in love with you as I
Always was

You still stir up that old desire
I can feel it now as we speak
Nothin I ever felt before
Prepared me for a love this deep
Yeah, I'm still crazy about you baby
In my heart and in my soul
Yeah, I'm still Mesmerized
By two brown eyes and a band of gold

Repeat Chours

Oh, I'm telling you the truth
I'm still as much in love with you as I
Always was
As I always was


That sunset straight up as it gets
Short shorts resting just right on your hips
Kiss chilling on your lips
I'm for sure going to get it in a minute
First time I take another sip
That Chevrolet sitting in the driveway
Is going to stay sitting, girl we ain't get anywhere, but closer
I know you're in the mood with literally nothing but each other on the to-do list


We got all damn day to do it our way
Like an old tire swing in the shade
Got it made in the sweet spot
Baby, you and me got a couple free seats on a cloud nine ride
Don't matter if we're sitting on the porch, in the car, at a bar
Or a boat down in Panama City
Gonna be a hell of a view
I'm just fine long as I'm sitting next to you sittin' pretty (yeah)
I'm sitting pretty good, I'm sitting pretty


Everything is feeling like it should
Don't think that it could, get any better
But this weather I wish it would
Turn up the heat, couple degrees
Get you in that AC, let down them blinds
Call it a day


We got all damn day to do it our way
Like an old tire swing in the shade
Got it made in the sweet spot
Baby, you and me got a couple free seats on a cloud nine ride
Don't matter if we're sitting on the porch, in the car, at a bar
Or a boat down in Panama City
Gonna be a hell of a view
I'm just fine long as I'm sitting next to you sittin' pretty (yeah)
I'm sitting pretty good, I'm sitting pretty (damn)
I'm sitting pretty good


Pretty as a peach
As a postcard picture
Of a west coast beach
So pretty, if I had to bet
This is pretty much as good as it gets


We got all damn day to do it our way
Like an old tire swing in the shade
Got it made in the sweet spot
Baby, you and me got a couple free seats on a cloud nine ride
Don't matter if we're sitting on the porch, in the car, at a bar
Or a boat down in Panama City
Gonna be a hell of a view
I'm just fine long as I'm sitting next to you sittin' pretty
(Yeah, I'm sitting pretty good)
I'm sitting pretty good, I'm sitting pretty
(Yeah, I'm sitting pretty good)
I'm sitting pretty good, I'm sitting pretty
(Yeah, I'm sitting pretty good)
I'm sitting pretty good


Let’s say we’re sorry, ’fore it’s too late
Give forgiveness a chance
Turn the anger into water
Let it slip through our hands


We all bleed red, we all taste rain
All fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret
We all cry tears, we all bleed red


If we’re fighting, we’re both losing
We’re just wasting our time
Because my scars, they are your scars
And your world is mine


You and I, we all bleed red, we all taste rain
All fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret
We all cry tears, we all bleed red


Sometimes we’re strong, sometimes we’re weak
Sometimes we’re hurt, and it cuts deep
We live this life, breath to breath
We’re all the same, we all bleed red


Let’s say we’re sorry
’Fore it’s too late


We all bleed red, all taste rain
All fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret
We all cry tears, we all bleed red


Sometimes we’re strong, sometimes we’re weak
Sometimes we’re hurt, it cuts deep
We live this life, breath to breath
We’re all the same, we all bleed red


Right now, nothing else matters
You and me and the Georgia night
Look around cause it don't get any better
Have you ever felt so alright?


Let's dance, take it slow
Tom Petty on the radio
And we're singing 'bout American girls like you
When I look in your eyes, all I want to do is


Bang bang, baby, like the 4th of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you
Can't let those colors fade
Tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red, white and


You pulling me a little bit closer
Heart beating like a big bass drum
We spinning on a roller coaster
Free falling into your yum yum


All the bad girls rocking in cut-off jeans
And good ol' boys driving big machines
And you can kiss my ass, can't help but say
It's good to be born in the USA


Bang bang, baby, like the 4th of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you
Can't let those colors fade
Tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red, white and you


Baby, sweet potato pie
All I need is red, white and
Baby, what we gonna do
And honey, don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is


Bang bang, baby, like the 4th of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you
Can't let those colors fade
Tell me you're gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red, white and you
Baby, baby, all I need is red, white and you
Don't give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red, white and you


Do you remember when we snuck out of the house
At the stroke of midnight
I was waitin' 'round the block
'Cause your daddy would have killed me if he'd seen me
You jumped in my ride, we made a beeline out of town
And I drove so fast, yeah I drove so fast


We were rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico you were kissing my neck
Yeah you had me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top
Dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
That's the way a night should feel


That was such a long time ago yeah
I'll never know how we made it
You're still that same wild child
And I don't take your love for granted
So let's jump in my ride, make a beeline out of town
And do it all again yeah like back when


We were rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico you were kissing my neck
Yeah you had me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top
Dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
The way a night should feel


When you're all about me and I'm all about you
(That's the way a night should feel)
Baby right now all I want to do, let's go


Rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico
Keep kissing my neck 'cause it keeps me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top
Dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel


The way a night should feel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel


The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find, it's true
The road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you


It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be


We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history; an epiphany
That all we need is us


It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin' love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be




Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know thats overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style, yeah
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string

Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

Gettin' out of the tub all drawn up like a raisin
Showed my fingers to my Daddy while he was shavin'
Said look at my toes Dad what's wrong with my skin
Will this go away, will I be normal again

Well he picked me up and set me down on the hamper
Wiped off his face while he gave me the answer
It was the first time I noticed lines in his grin
As he dabbed a little foam on the end of my chin, he said

Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of
They're just a product of time and true love
Some are gonna come and go
Some are gonna come and stay
Son, you're still young, you're gonna be ok

Well I walked down the hall, saw my Momma gettin ready
For a long over due date, dinner with Daddy
She was cussin' those crows feet, didn't know I was listenin'
Started talkin' 'bout her younger years
And how much she missed them and I said

Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of
They're just a product of time and true love
Some are gonna come and go
Some are gonna come and stay
Mom you still look young, you're gonna be ok

As I get a little older, I'm startin' to get a few
And I'm sure I gave Mom and Dad at least one or two
We're all gonna have 'em, there ain't no doubt
But those wrinkles in life ain't nothin' you can't iron out

Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of
Some are gonna come and go
Some are gonna come and stay
I still feel young, I'm gonna be ok

Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of


Hey white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
White liar


You better be careful what you do
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes
If they ever found you out
You better be careful what you say
It never really added up any way
I got friends in this town




You said you went out to a bar
And walked some lady to her car
But your face has more to tell
Cause my cousin saw you on the street
With a red head named Bernice
Turns out you don't lie too well




Here's a bombshell just for you
Turns out I've been lying too




I be sitting in the same old bar
Heart breaking on a broken bar stool
Wishing she'd come running back
Running from the past
Runnin' up the tab, drinkin' for two
But that night my boys showed up
Dragged me out on the town
Had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't


'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found you


Yeah, I still go out sometimes
But I don't ever try to get that drunk
Now and I can't sleep it's 'cause you're all over me in the sheets
All night keeping me up
Yeah, it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me


No, I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you


And now I'm takin' back the way I said I wish I've never met
Sometimes the things that don't work out
Couldn't work out any better
I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you


'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found, never found you
No, I'd have never found you


Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weather man called for a twister
She prayed blow it down


There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past


Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away


She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge


Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away


There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past


Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away


Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

You showed up at the party
You wasn't gonna stay too long
But that all changed up when your song came on
Somebody handed you a cup
So you went with the flow and you filled it on up
You feel the buzz in your bones
And then you start making the rounds
You know all too well what's about to go down
You say "hold up, I better go"
Yeah right, next thing you know...
You look up and it's 2 in the morning
You're still sipping whatever they're pouring
You got your shades on, you got your drink up
Like you're VIP at the nightclub
You kissed a girl and she told you her secrets
She's so hot, you still can't believe it's true
It ain't over yet, but it's gonna be a hard to remember
Night that you'll never forget
Now you're phone's filled up
With pictures that you didn't take
And it's you throwing deuces with 'what's her name'
And there's your boys right there
Tailgate poker table all in on a pair
Here come the country girls
They wanna dance all on ya, wanna rock your world
It was supposed to be a regular night (Regular night)
But now you're like
"To the left, to the left, to the right."
You look up and it's 3 in the morning
You're still sipping whatever they're pouring
You got your shades on, you got your drink up
Like you're VIP at the nightclub
You kissed a girl and she told you her secrets
She's so hot, you still can't believe it's true
It ain't over yet, but it's gonna be a hard to remember
Night that you'll never forget
To the left, to the left, to the left, to the right
You look up and it's 4 in the morning
You're still sipping whatever they're pouring
You got your shades on, you got your drink up
Here's to the nights that memories are made of
You kissed a girl and she told you her secrets
She's so hot, you still can't believe it's true
It ain't over yet, but it's gonna be a hard to remember
Night that you'll never forget
To the left, to the left, to the left, to the right
To the left, to the left, to the left, to the right


Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
Mama used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing


Said he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
"How you keep from goin' crazy"
He said, "I'll see my wife and son in just a little while"
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled


Said, "I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh, I believe"


A few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Gettin' all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said, "Oh, by the way son
Old man Wrigley has died"


Later on that night
I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody
Deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man
Who looked me in the eye


Said, "I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see..."


I can't quote the book
The chapter or the verse
You can't tell me it all ends
In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that I live
Yeah, this can't be... no, this can't be
No, this can't be all there is


Lord, I raise my hands
Bow my head
Oh, I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to this
Than just what I can see, I believe


Oh, I...
I believe
I believe
(I believe)
(I believe)
Well, I believe
(I believe)
I believe
(I believe)


Grandma burned the biscuits
Nearly took the house down with it
Now she's in assisted livin'
We all knew that day would come
We knew she was to gone to drive
The day she parked on I-65
Found her on the shoulder cryin'
She didn't know where she was
Its like her mind just quit
Oh but bring up grandpa- its like someone flipped a switch


A front porch light and a blue Desota
Couple a straws and a coca cola:
You can see it all going down
A handsome boy in army green
A tear on his face- down on a knee
Shaky voice- a diamond ring ...she'll put you in that town
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas, 1948


She takes out his medals
A cigar box of letters
Sits and scatters pictures
Black and whites of days gone by
We started losing her when she lost him
But to hear her carry on you'd swear she's seventeen again


Football games and leaves a'crackling
Walking her home in his letter jacket
You can see it all going down
A perfect night on a front porch glider
Saying goodnight for the next 3 hours
Her tired eyes grow wide and bright
When she talks about that town
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas 1948


While the world is fading all around her
Sharing a sundae at the counter
He's going on and on about her
But she's right there right now
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas 1948

He was never much for shopping
But you'd always see him with her at the store
She was never much for football
She'd sit there and pretend she wasn't bored
You saw one you saw the other
Like a two lane Texas highway straight and true
But just over that horizon the road that they were riding split in two

Separate ways, his and hers
A love that went from great to good to bad to worse
Separate lives, what a waste
The last thing they ever did together was go their separate ways

It really scares me baby
How easily that good love slipped away
Let's remember that forever is something that we should work at everyday
And after all those years together, it killed me when I saw their love go bad
So let's hold on to each other and don't end up like my mother and my dad

Separate ways his and hers
A love that went from great to good to bad to worse
Separate lives what a waste
The last thing they ever did together was go their separate ways

Yeah the last thing they ever did together
Will haunt me forever and ever
Let's promise one another that we'll never go our separate ways

There's a bottle on the shelf, talkin' to me
Sayin', "Come over here, you can have a drink"
We can make it through this lonely night together

But that's a road I don't wanna go back down
And I hate myself for what I'm thinkin' now
Hey, it's just one night, it's not like it's forever
I just want to feel better

I just want to feel good, feel alright
Feel anything but what I feel tonight
I just want to move on with my life
And put the pieces back together
I just want to feel better

All these pictures running through my head
From the way he loved to the way he left
Not a single day goes by, I don't miss him

When the lonely gets to be too much
I try to kill the pain with a stranger's touch
Though I know I won't forget him altogether
I just want to feel better

I just want to feel good, feel alright
Feel anything but what I feel tonight
I just want to move on with my life
And put the pieces back together
I just want to feel better

I know there's gonna come a day
When he's still gone and it's okay

I just want to feel good, feel alright
Feel anything but what I feel tonight
I just want to move on with my life
And put the pieces back together
I just want to feel better
I just want to feel better

6 a.m alarm goes off
I reach for you no longer lie but don't feel quite as lost
Everyday, I drive my truck a little farther into work before your memory catchs up
The radio on, I'm not afraid
I can listen to most any song the DJ wants to play
Slow but sure, I'm coming around

No I'm not looking back I'm moving on now
But I won't go so far as to say that I'm fine too much of what I felt for you remains
I'd like to believe in the healing hands of time but the truth is I really can't say if
I'm getting better or just used to the pain
End of the day head back home have a bite to eat then sit down in the living room alone
Easy chair, watch tv
Half way through the news I'm soundly sleeping but
I won't go so far to say that I'm fine too much of what I felt for you remains

I'd like to believe in the healing hands of time but the truth is
I really can't say if I'm getting better or just used to the pain
No I won't go so far as to say that I'm fine too much of what I felt for you remains
I'd like to believe in the healing hands of time but the truth is
I really can't say if I'm getting better or just used to the pain
If I'm getting better or just used to the pain

I been losin' my mind one love at a time
Gettin' up just to be knocked down
But with all of that pain I come back again
And I always go one more round

Women, me and love
We just can't get it right
I might lose the battle
But I love the fight 

No love you ain't seen the last of me
I just keep comin' back to see if I can capture the dream
Yeah love you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily, no you ain't seen the last of me

I got a big long list of all the times
I've missed when I zeroed in on love
And at times it seems like one heartache
Begins where the last one has just left off

And tonight it looks like another
One is aimed in my heart
And she's looking at me
And I'm feeling that feelin' start 

Oh, love you ain't seen the last of me
I just keep comin' back to see if I can capture the dream
Yeah love you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily, no you ain't seen the last of me

And tonight it looks like another
One is aimed in my heart
And she's looking at me
And I'm feeling that feelin' start

Oh, love you ain't seen the last of me
I just keep comin' back to see if I can capture the dream
Yeah love you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily, no you ain't seen the last of me

Yeah, love you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily, no you ain't seen the last of me...


It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep starin' at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore


If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time


If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun, what else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway


If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time


Goodbye, Baby


I know you've seen all your dreams turn to dust
I know your heart's been left in the rain to rust
But you won't be lonely now


I see a long trail of tears in your eyes
Back to the day when the innocence died
But you won't be lonely now


I wanna give you everything you need I wanna show you
You won't be lonely you won't be lonely now


Holding you here like a rose in the dark
I make this promise to you from my heart
You won't be lonely now




I'll do anything to make you see how I'm gonna love you
You won't be lonely you won't be lonely now


Now that you're here in my arms I'm alive
For the first time in a long time
I look at my face in the mirror and see
The man that I've wanted to be






As I walk along I wonder
What went wrong with our love
A love so rare and strong
And as I walk along, I think of
The times we had together
While our hearts were young


I'm a walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery and I wonder
I wa wa wa wonder
Why, why why why why why she ran away
And I wonder where she will stay
My little runaway, a run run run run runaway


A run run run run runaway


Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store
Put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet


Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list


Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things
Like pushing' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today like


Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list


Raise a little hell, laugh 'till it hurts
Put an extra five in the plate at church
Call up my folks just to chat
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, then oversleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start living', that's the next thing on my list


Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today


I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Baby, you
Baby


I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you Baby


All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing'
I hear those sleigh bells ringing'
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Oh bring my baby to me


I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking' for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you Baby
You Baby
You Baby
You

Hey baby, let's jump in your truck
We'll ride and watch for lightning bugs
We'll ride with the windows let down
There's nowhere else I'd rather be right now

'Cause there ain't nothing like the sound of a cooler slushing
On the bed of your truck
And ain't nothing like the sound of real country music
C'mon, turn it up
And I love to hear the whippoorwill sing any night
And the crickets out in the woods
Ooh, and don't it feel so right
Don't it sound so good

We'll stop on a old dirt road bridge
Do you remember when we painted our names on it
And we'll listen to the creek as it runs
And we'll count the stars
Every single one

'Cause there ain't nothing like the sound of a cooler slushing
On the bed of your truck
And ain't nothing like the sound of real country music
C'mon, turn it up
And I love to hear the whippoorwill sing any night
And the crickets out in the woods
Ooh, and don't it feel so right
Don't it sound so good

'Cause there ain't nothing like the sound of a cooler slushing
On the bed of your truck
And ain't nothing like the sound of real country music
C'mon, turn it up
And I love to hear the whippoorwill sing any night
And the crickets out in the woods
Ooh, don't it feel so right
Don't it sound so good
Ooh, don't it feel so right
Don't it sound so good

Yeah, it sounds so good
Yeah, it sounds so good


Times are tough and times are strange
But time's one thing that you can't change
Love is a noun and love is a verb
But sometimes love is a dirty word
It don't matter what tomorrow brings
Tonight you just need to think about one thing
And that's showing up and letting go
And maybe getting just a little out of control


And sing ohh
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night, in the lights
Cuttin' loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
That's all I'm talking about


The sun will shine
And the clouds will rain
Might have to learn to smile through the pain
You lose a step but you gain a friend
Might even catch a break every now and then
So don't sweat it just let it slide
And when you get on the road baby let it ride
You gotta get up to get down
You gotta unwind a little to come on 'round


And sing ohh
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night, in the lights
Cuttin' loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
That's all I'm talking about



And when you get tired of trying to be
Who they want you to be
Be what you wanna be
Well come on, come on


And sing ohh
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night, in the lights
Cuttin' loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
That's all I'm talking about

And sing ohh
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night, in the lights
Cuttin' loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
That's all I'm talking about


I've been climbing my way through the sky
Searching for answers that I'll never find
Losing my breath as I fall
Learning to fly, letting go of it all
Learning to fly, letting go of it all
I've been trying to open my eyes
Take it all in as the world passes by
Getting lost in the twists and the turn
Finding these questions inside me still burn
Finding these questions inside me still burn


I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow never comes
There's no end in sight
Tonight we black out the sun
Better hold on tight
Before you know it's gone
And live like tomorrow never comes


I keep looking for some kind of sign
Trying to hold on in this race against time
I can't say where the next bend might be
That is the beauty in life's mystery
That is the beauty in life's mystery


I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow never comes
There's no end in sight
Tonight we black out the sun
Better hold on tight
Before you know it's gone
And live like tomorrow never comes


There's no end in sight
For tonight we black out the sun


When you light those candles
Up there on that mantle
Setting the mood
Well, I just lie there staring
Silently preparing
To love on you
Well, I can feel the heat
From across the room
Ain't it wild
What a little flame
Can make you wanna do


I melt, every time you
Look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me
Is the coolest thing
I've ever felt
I melt


Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, every time
What's even better is knowing
That forever you're all mine
The closer you get
The more my body aches
One little stare from you
Is all it takes








Every time you
Look at me that way
I melt, I melt


I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night


I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself


I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah


I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah


Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way


I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else (no one else, baby)
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall (paint the wall)
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket (in my back pocket)
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah



Turn the quiet up, turn the noise down
Let this ol' world just spin around
I wanna feel it swing, wanna feel it sway
And put some feel good in my soul
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

Want a little more right, and a little less left
Little more right now, a little less what's next
Act like tomorrow's ten years away
And just kick back and let the feelin' flow
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke


I set my sails for a new direction
But the wind got in my way
I changed my course
But my definition of change
Just ain't the same

I'm gonna sit right here
Stay away from there
I'm gonna make pretend
I just don't care
And I could get up
Go get her back
Or maybe I'll just let her go
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
(ah come on now)
Go get her back (ohhh)
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Drink a little drink smoke a little, smoke
(You guys put your hands together like this)


Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Fire it up, take me back


Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Fire it up, memory crash


Oh no, I don’t know
Baby, it might take, all night
Then I’ll maybe break out that old rock and roll
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

(Lets all stay out here and..)
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke



Well I've woke up in places that I couldn't remember
Who's lying next to me or even how I got there
That's hard to believe but that's how I used to roll
One Tuesday night in an underground pool hall
That's where I saw her for the first time
Right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walking down a new road


And when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
Love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I am right at home when I'm holdin' her


On a park bench down on 4th Street
That's where I popped the question
And to my amazement she actually said yes
And tears filled my eyes as I slipped that ring on her hand
And then a few short years later God put into my world
A 6 pound and 8 ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day let me tell you know
I became a brand new man... because


When I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
Love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I am right at home when I'm holdin' her


I am right at home
When I'm holdin' her

Well last night me and darlin
We went explorin
Pulled off the road to a place we'd never been
I had to stop the truck because it was gettin muddy
We started kissin, then I put it in...

Four-Wheel Drive
And we kept on goin
Man what a ride

It made me feel like a kid again
Slippin and sliddin
Bouncin around in the cab
Bringin back old memories of all the good times we've had

Then I pulled it out
Back on the main road
I looked over at darlin
Her face was all a glow
She said honey that was wonderful can we do it again
So I leaned over toward her and I put it back in

It made me feel like a kid again
Slippin and sliddin
Bouncin around in the cab
Bringin back old memories of all the good times we've had

Yeah darlin loves it when I put it in...four wheel drive

Sure thing, you're a sweet dream
And I'm flattered... believe that
I do appreciate the offer...
All right, just one dance
Lord, I must to God, you sure feel good
Against my skin
I'd like to fade into the night with you
But my heart won't let me pretend

Easy does it, beautiful...
She ain't been gone that long
An' I'm a real reluctant Romeo
Baby, better take it slow
Easy does it, beautiful
Easy does it

I still feel a bit tender
A little unsure of where I stand
One minute, I surrender
The next one, I'm holdin' back
Now, I don't want to push you away...
The truth is, I want this...
But I need a little time, baby
I just can't be rushin' in

Easy does it, beautiful...
She ain't been gone that long
An' I'm a real reluctant Romeo
Baby, better take it slow
Easy does it, beautiful
Easy does it

They say patience is a virtue
An' I believed that till I met you

Easy does it, beautiful...
She ain't been gone that long
An' I'm a real reluctant Romeo
Baby, better take it slow
Easy does it, beautiful
Easy does it

Easy does it. (Easy does it.)
Easy does it, yeah, oh
Easy does it. (Easy does it.)
Easy does it
Easy does it. (Easy does it.)

They've got shiny cars and polished nails
Yeah those girls they've got everything right
They've got fancy clothes, perfect hair, steady lives
But I don't

They're the first to send out thank you notes
They've got well kept homes to entertain
They'll do anything just to please you
But I won't

If these are the girls that you choose
What makes you think I'd be good for you

Can you tell me baby
What do you see in me
I'm a fast ride, I'm a crashing tide, and I'm crazy

Can you tell me baby
What do you see in me
You've loved a long line of consistency
I'm a different breed

Every time you take me out, boy
We see another girl who's held your hand
And she acts like she doesn't care you're with me
But I know

She don't like the way I look on you
I make her nervous ‘cause I don't fit in
With my deep brown eyes, cigarette, cowboy boots
I stand alone

Well baby, I wonder if you
Know what you're getting
Yourself into

Can you tell me, baby
What do you see in me
I'm a fast ride, I'm a crashing tide, and I'm crazy

Can you tell me, baby
What do you see in me
You've loved a long line of consistency
I'm a different breed

Can you tell me, baby
What do you see in me
I'm a fast ride, I'm a crashing tide, and I'm crazy

Can you tell me, baby
What do you see in me
You've loved a long line of consistency
I'm a different breed, different breed
I'm a different breed

What do you see in me, in me
I'm a different breed

Can you tell me baby, can you tell me baby
Can you tell me baby, tell me baby

I'm a different breed

They called him crazy when they started out
Said seventeen's too young to know what love's about
They've been together fifty-eight years now
That's crazy

He brought home sixty-seven bucks a week
He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Yeah that's crazy

Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

They called him crazy when he quit his job
Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off
He sold his one man shop to Microsoft
They paid like crazy

Just ask him how he made it, he'll tell you faith and sweat
And the heart of a faithful woman, Who never let him forget

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

Always treat your woman like a lady
Never get to old to call her baby
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

They called him crazy when they started out
They've been together fifty-eight years now
Ain't that crazy?


I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me


And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do


I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye


And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do


Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do


And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do


I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me


We say goodbye see you around
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up we make up and we make love
We can’t seem to let go girl


So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over


I’m all alone, but you’re on my phone
Tellin' me you miss me and that you’re at home
Who knows what we are in the mornin'
All I know is I want you


So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
Ooh, I’m comin' over


Yeah we said that we’re done and I know that it’s late
But you already know, I’m on my way


I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire that’s burnin'
I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
I’m comin' over


Someday we're gonna look back on a night like tonight
The car I pulled up in, the necklace you're wearing won't even cross our minds
Someday we're gonna blink twice, say it happens like that
How much money we saved up for the time that we gave up
Well, it'll all just be math


I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score


If we're rich to somebody, we're poor to somebody else
We could be happy and nameless
Or broken and famous
But, from what I can tell
Is that it doesn't really matter
You can't take it with you when you go
Life is only getting faster (life is only getting faster)
So, baby, I'd rather take tonight nice and slow


'Cause I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score


Be with me now
Be with me right now
Be with me right here, right now
Be with me now
Be with me right now
Be with me right here, right now


I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score
Oh, yeah
Keeping score

La, da, da, da
De de de de de


The moment was custom-made to order
I was riding with my daughter on our way back from Monroe
And like children do
She started playing twenty questions
But I never could of guessed one would touch me to my soul


She said
Daddy, when we get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
Are we going there to visit
Or are we going there to stay?

Am I gonna see my Grandpa?
Can I have a pair of wings?
And do you think that God could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?

La, da, da
Da, de, de, de, de


Well, I won't lie
I pulled that car right over
And I sat there on the shoulder
Trying to dry my misty eyes

And I whispered
Lord, I wanna thank you for my children
Cause your innocence that fills them
Often takes me by surprise like


Daddy, when we get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
Are we goin' there to visit
Or are we goin' there to stay?

Am I gonna see my Grandpa?
Can I have a pair of wings?
And do you think that God could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?


Well, I thought about it later on
And a smile came to my face
And when I tucked her in to bed
I got down on my knees and prayed


Lord, when I get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
I don't wanna come to visit
Cause I'm coming home to stay?

And I can't wait to see my family
And meet Jesus face to face
And do you think, Lord
You could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?

Mmmm
Can I help pour out the rain?
Can I help pour out the rain?

La, da, da, da
De, de, de, de

Baby, let's take a drive
Top down underneath the Carolina sky
We can watch the fireflies try to outshine the stars
I wanna lay a blanket down
Find a way back to where our love was found
Baby let's go right now

Back to our hearts beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies
First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on baby, take my hand
Let's find a way back to our crazy days

Don't worry about what to wear
Those faded cut off jeans are my favorite pair
Don't go messin' with your hair
Let it all blow around
Move over in the middle by me
Just like you did when your daddy couldn't see
Why his little girl loved a boy like me

Back to our hearts beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies
First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on baby, take my hand
Let's find a way back to our crazy days

You remember cuttin' class
Heading to the creek
Doin' 95 down a two-lane street
Staying up all night talkin' about forever you and me
I can see that look in your eyes
And if I know you, they don't lie
They're telling me you're think about going back
About getting back

Back to our hearts beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies
First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on baby, take my hand
Let's find a way back to our crazy days


They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired


Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on


Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll


Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on


The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon


Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on


Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight

Buddy you and me go way back
Camp Lejeune, all through high school
And before that
So I don't mind telling you I'm scared to death
The doctor's going in on the 25th
It's the same thing my daddy had
Thank God they caught it fast

But if something should happen
Stop in sometime and say hello to Katherine
You and Mary Anne could always keep her laughing
She's going to need a lot of that
Take her out to a movie
Its going to take some time before she's back on her feet
I know you think that I'll be fine and I'm talking crazy
But there's always that chance
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

Little Nathan's growing up so fast
This November he'll turn 10
He wants to play quarterback
I'm supposed to coach his team this fall
But I may not get to after all
He's going to need someone to catch a pass
And to throw it back

If something should happen
Oh promise me you'll take that boy out camping
Throw a line out in that water every now and then
Answer any question that he has
Maybe once he gets older
You can sit and have that first cold beer together
And tell him a couple stories on his father
He's always known you were my best friend
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

I hope I live until I'm 80
And I get to see my son get married
And have babies
And make a million more memories with my wife
Yeah buddy I pray alright
But if its my time to leave
Would you watch over them for me?
If something should happen
If something should happen
Mm hmm hmm


Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air
I was three years old
Splashing everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water

On a river bank
With all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And you’re a big old wuss
If you don't jump in
The water


Yeah when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old igloo
Drive until the map turns blue


Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water

Oh let her go boys


Yeah when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you want to see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue


You can stay right there
When the daylights gone
Play truth or dare
And it won’t take long
'Fore you and her got nothing on
But water

All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades
And ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water

He drove away, I couldn't move
First bitter taste of what love can do
Sat on that porch, alone and cried
It hurt so bad, I could've died
Then Mama came out wrapped her arms around me told me
God has someone better for me, dried my tears,then she just held me

That's what Angels do, that's what love is for
Points you to a window when you can't find the door
When you're out of faith, it's more then you can take
You're not strong enough you need someone to pull you through
That's what Angels do

Big city steets, bright city lights
Some days the dream's not worth the fight
Miss my hometown-wide open space
A clear blue sky,a slower pace
Then the phone rings and I hear his vioce
Say baby girl I'm so proud of you, you're not alone

He give me hope, he lifts me up

That's what Angels do, that's what love is for
Points you to a window when you can't find the door
When you're out of faith, it's more then you can take
You're not strong enough you need someone to pull you through
That's what Angels do

That's what Angels do, that's what love is for
Points you to a window when you can't find the door
When you're out of faith, it's more then you can take
You're not strong enough you need someone to pull you through
That's what Angels do

When there's no way on earth and you can't make it work
That's what Angels do


Damn girl, I didn't know you'd be here
Been a while, it's sure good to see you
Rollin' in here, ready to rock
Standin' there sippin' that shiner bock
We're pickin' up right where we left off last time
I'll drop a quarter in that jukebox
If you'll dance the way you know I like
In and out of that neon light
And if I kiss you up against the wall, it ain't my fault


Cause I can't turn it off, turn it off, turn it off the way you turn it
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, girl I'll admit right now
I'm just about halfway gone, baby you can do no wrong
And I can't turn it off the way you turn it on


You'll sing along like I'm the only one that's listening
You lit the fuse, now you've got all of my attention
Just let me know when you're ready to leave
Say the word we'll get on this thing
In stereo, little rodeo, baby here we go


Cause I can't turn it off, turn it off, turn it off the way you turn it
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, girl I'll admit right now
I'm just about halfway gone, baby you can do no wrong
And I can't turn it off the way you turn it on
The way you turn it on
The way you turn it on

I can't turn it off, turn it off, turn it off the way you turn it
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, girl I'll admit right now
I'm just about halfway gone, baby you can do no wrong
And I can't turn it off the way you turn it on
The way you turn it on
The way you turn it on


Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
The way you
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
The way you
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on


When I get where I'm going
On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly


I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop of rain


Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here


I'm gonna walk with my grand daddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I missed him
Every minute since he left
Then I'll hug his neck




So much pain and so much darkness
In this world we stumble through
All these questions I can't answer
So much work to do


But when I get where I'm going
And I see my maker's face
I'll stand forever in the light
Of his amazing grace
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
Hallelujah
I will love and have no fear
When I get where I'm going
Yeah when I get where I'm going

You gotta get off the clock and get on the phone
And tell everyone you know
To get on over to my house
And leave their worries there by the door

It's probably gonna get a little crazy
Your memory's gonna be a little hazy
But you don't forget it
That's right I said it
It's gonna be, epic

If you want some, come and get some
We got enough girl to go around
Just good friends having a good time
Everybody is throwing down
We're living it up, living it up, living like you never, ever done before
If you want some, come and get some
If you run out, come back for more

And now don't run for your truck if the blue lights show up
Just everybody keep your cool
My cousin's a cop and we ain't gonna stop
Cause he's here to party too

It's probably gonna get a little crazy
Your memory's gonna be a little hazy
But you don't forget it
That's right I said it
It's gonna be, epic

If you want some, come and get some
We got enough girl to go around
Just good friends having a good time
Everybody is throwing down
We're living it up, living it up, living like you never, ever done before
If you want some, come and get some
If you run out, come back for more

We don't need reminding, it's been a hard week
Girl let's unwind and
Come on baby, you know what to do, yeah

If you want some, come and get some
We got enough girl to go around
Just good friends having a good time
Everybody is throwing down
We're living it up, living it up, living like you never, ever done before
If you want some, come and get some
If you run out, come back for more, yeah


Pair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hanging memories on the high line poles
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go


Ragweed's rocking on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rolling like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go


Got the sun shining on me like a big spotlight
So I know everything is going to be alright


Ain't no telling where the wind might blow
Free and easy down the road I go
Living life like a Sunday stroll
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go


If you only get to go around one time
I'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the ride


I could make a million or wind up broke
Free and easy down the road I go
Can't take it with you when you go so


Free and easy down the road I go
Someday I know it's going to take me home so
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go

I was fifteen left home young
Tore up the tracks and then some
Me and my dad didn't see eye to eye
I never took to him
He never took the time
Bullet proof
More than tough
Smarter than he ever was

Well I burned those wheels down the highway
And I learned what I learned the hard way
Do the best you can do
Love many trust few
Work hard for the money in your hands
Thats the measure of a man
Yeah the measure of a man

Anger burns, love cools it down
Pretty young woman turned my head around
The world through her eyes looked so different

She lives on faith, she looks for forgiveness
Fool proof, it ain't easy
I need her, she needs me

She stole my heart on this highway
She taught me to love through the hard days
Yeah she's cool when I'm not, she's as steady as a rock
She's as solid as the ring on my hand
That's the measure of a man
Yeah the measure of a man

Last night she handed me a son of my own
It killed me to do it, but I picked up the phone

Hey dad I burned ten years down this highway
And I learned what I learned the hard way
Truth is I need you, we'll cry if we need to
And I'll swallow my pride if you can
That's the measure of a man
Oh yeah, the measure of a man

Well, I've been sitting on this couch for an hour
Waiting for something to transpire
I've tried almost every trick I know
Well, I've even got Sinatra on the stereo

Give me your love
Give me your love
That's what I need
That's what I need
How can I make you understand?
Give me you love
Give me your love
That's what I'm needin'
That's what I'm needin'
Oh, girl, don't make me beg
Please, please, please, please, please
Don't make me beg!

Well, I've tried to let you know with subtle charms
That, girl, I've got to hold you in my arms
And if it ain't too obvious by now
Honey, I'm just gonna spell it out

Give me your love
Give me your love
That's what I need
That's what I need
How can I make you understand?
Give me you love
Give me your love
That's what I'm needin'
That's what I'm needin'
Oh, girl, don't make me beg
Please, please, please, please, please
Don't make me beg!

Now, I don't want to come off like a fool
But, girl, I think that I'm in love with you!

Give me your love
Give me your love
That's what I need
That's what I need
How can I make you understand?
Give me you love
Give me your love
That's what I'm needin'
That's what I'm needin'
Oh, girl, don't make me beg
Please, please, please, please, please
Don't make me beg!

Oh, Honey, please, please, please, please, please
Don't make me beg!
Oh, Honey, please, please, please, please, please
Don't make me beg!

I want a road stretching out before me
I want a radio in my ear
I want a full tank of absolution
No Fear

I want a rainstorm to pull me over
Then a sky that begins to clear
Towards the truest of destinations
No Fear

Chorus:
I used to hit every wall there was
I used to run away from love
All I ever wanted was right here
But I had to reach way down inside
I had to have faith I'd find
No Fear

I want the world to just keep on turning
I want the dawn in my rearview mirror
I want to hear my own voice singing
No Fear

And when I need two arms around me
And there's no one near
When I'm alone let the only sound be
No Fear

Repeat Chorus

I want peace, love, and understanding
A stogie and an ice-cold beer
Don't wanna live afraid of dying

I used to hit every wall there was
I used to run away from love
All I ever wanted was right here
But I had to reach way down inside

I used to stay up all night long
Wondering what I was doing wrong
All I ever needed was right here
But I had to reach way down inside
I had to have faith I'd find
No Fear
No Fear
No Fear


Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be far away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
(Here we are as in olden days, happy golden days of yore)
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now (x2)


I have felt it
And I have held it
I have known
A woman's love
I have tasted
And I have wasted
A woman's love


And I know
I'll never understand
All the little things
That make it grand
A woman's love


And I know
I'll never come face to face
With any thing
That takes the place
Of a woman's love


Well, I have kiss it
Tried to resist it
I have missed
A woman's love
And I have hated
Taken for granted
A woman's love






Well I have needed
And I have pleaded
And I have lost
A woman's love
And I have worshipped
And I have cursed it
A woman's love






Well I adore it
And thank God for it
A woman's love


It was a home run when the game was tied
A pick up truck when I could drive
One pink line when Katie said I'm late
It was a passing grade, a pretty girl
All the money in the world
What mattered then kept changing every day


But when I bow my head tonight
There'll be no me, myself and I
Just watch my wife and kids please Lord
That's all I ask for any more


Nowadays it's crazy how
A passing storm, a siren sound
Can make me drop it all and pick up the phone
To hear her say that all's okay is all I need to know these days
Can't wait to see their faces when I get home




Let them outlive me by a hundred years
Let their laughter dry up all their tears
Let them love and be loved back like I have been




That's all that matters anymore

I've heard a million country songs
'Bout love gone wrong, good times, and crazy women
And I've sung about tractors
Trucks, fast cars, and small town living

And I'd love to hear a band that rocks
And words that make you stop
And think about family
If you ask me

Oughta be more songs about that old man
Who worked hard all his life
Then Wall Street broke his NASDAQ
Now he can't afford to die

And more songs about forgivin'
And other things that I believe in like Jesus
And lettin' him back in class
Oughta be more songs
Oughta be more songs about that

I like me a good old cheatin' song
In a honky tonk with cold beer and a buddy
And I like to sing just as I am
With a congregation and a little church to come some day

And I love to dance a slow dance
To a love song with my baby
And the lights down low
Yeah, but we all know

There oughta be more songs about them angles
Volunteerin' at the mission
Fixing food for the homeless
And givin' toys to needy children

And more songs about those soilders whose war is never over
Who made it home but never quite came back
Oughta be more songs
Oughta be more songs 'bout that

Oughta be more songs about us common folk
Puttin' in 8 days a week
And burning both ends of the candle
Just tryin' to make ends meet

And more songs about them singers
Who paved this road I'm on
Some gone but not forgotten
Some still goin' strong

There's Waylon, Hank, my daddy, and the man in black
Oughta be more songs about that
More songs, more songs about that
More songs, more songs about that

Clint Black & Lisa Hartman Black

These times are trouble
And these times are good
There always gonna be
They rise and they fall
We take them all the way that we should
Together you and me
Forsaking them all

Deep in the night
And by the light of day
It always looks the same
True love always does
Here by your side or a million miles away
Nothin' is ever gonna change the way I feel
The way it is, is the way that it was

Chorus:
When I said I do, I meant that I will
Til' the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind, when I said I do

Well this whole world keeps changin'
And the world stays the same
For all who came before
And it goes hand in hand

Only you and I can undo
All that we became
That makes us so much more (so much more)
Than a woman and a man

After everything
That comes and goes around
Has only passed us by
Here alone in our dreams

I know there's a lonely heart
In every lost and found
But forever you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means

Chorus

Truer than true
You know that I'll always be there for you

That's what I had in mind
That's what I had in mind

Together:
When I said I do

I don't wanna break this moment
I don't wanna twist our fate
I don't wanna sympathize or complicate

I don't wanna go down easy
Somethin' bout you makes me high
A little angel tells me don't let this one bite
Don't be shy, testify

Let me love you from this moment
Let me dare to dream that far
Let me fall, let me rise, let me dance in your eyes
And show you who you are

Let me wrap myself around your secrets
Till the stars burn into blue
Let me kiss, let me touch, close your eyes
And just let me love you, ooh yeah

Girl I wanna be the reason
I wanna be your alibi
I wanna be the one who holds you when you cry

I wanna see the place inside you
Where no one else has ever been
I wanna know all your fears and all your sins
So let me in

Let me love you from this moment
Let me dare to dream that far
Let me fall, let me rise, let me dance in your eyes
And show you who you are

Let me wrap myself around your secrets
Until the stars burn into blue
Let me kiss, let me touch, close your eyes
And just let me love you
Girl let me love you

Let me love you from this moment
Let me dare to dream that far
Let me fall, let me rise, let me dance in your eyes
And show you who you are

Let me wrap myself around your secrets
Until the stars burn into blue
Let me kiss, let me touch, close your eyes
And just let me love you
Girl let me love you yeah

Well the truth
Well it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin back
But before I get to goin' I've got to say
I know you used to love me
But that was yesterday
And the truth, I won't fight it
When the love starts burnin you got to do whats right

Woah, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Woah, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Well the truth
Yeah, it hurts to say

And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin back
But before I get to going
There was a time oh woman
When you used to shake it for me
Now all you do is treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more
Gonna walk out the door

Lover, lover, lover
You dont treat me no good no more
No, no, more more more
Woah, lover lover lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Yea, yea, yea

Well I went with you on a starry night

Woman oh woman
You know I love you so
You're just so mean to me baby Im walkin out the door

Lover oh lover
I know you used to love me in every way, but now I'm givin up
And I'm tired of cryin babe

Lover, lover, lover

Lover, lover, lover

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more

He wore that cowboy hat to cover up his horns
Sweet talking forked tongue, had a tempting charm
Before I turned around that girl was gone
All I can say is, bartender pour me something strong

Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will and I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville

It was long and chrome, sitting in the lot
Fire engine red, that thing was hot
He reved it up, she waved goodbye
Love's gone to hell and so have I

Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will and I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville

Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will and I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville

When I walked in the band just started
The singer couldn't carry a tune in a bucket
Was on a mission to drown her memory but
I thought no way with all this ruckus

But after one round with Jose Cuervo
I caught my boots tappin 'long with the beat
And after two rounds with Jose Cuervo
That band was sounding pretty darn good to me

Then some stranger asked me dance
And I revealed to her my two left feet
Said, Don't get me wrong I'm glad you asked
But tonight's about me and an old memory

Then after three rounds with Jose Cuervo
I let her lead me out on the floor
And after four rounds with Jose Cuervo
I was showin' off moves never seen before

Well, around five or round six
I forgot what I came to forget
After round seven or was it eight
I bought a round for the whole dang place!

After nine rounds with Jose Cuervo
They were countin' me out and I was about to give in
The after ten rounds with Jose Cuervo
I lost count and started countin' again!

One round with Jose Cuervo
I went two rounds with Jose Cuervo
Three rounds with Jose Cuervo
Five rounds with Jose Cuervo or was it four?
Six rounds with Jose Cuervo
Eight rounds with Jose Cuervo
Ten rounds with Jose Cuervo...

We work in the factories and the fields
Assembly lines, the coal mines and the steel mills
That's what we do  but there's more than us than that
If you want to know who we are it's on the logos of our caps

We're Mountaineers, Volunteers
We're the Tide that rolls, we're Seminoles
We're the herd of long steer
We drive Ford and Chevrolet
Cheer twenty-four and eighty-eight
We crank up our music Friday nights
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right

We might fix your water pump, your AC
Bring your apple pie, and fill your glass of tea
Take that FedEx package to your door
But underneath that apron or that uniform

We're Wild Cats, Wolverines
We're Tigers, Buckeyes, Bruins
Bulldogs, Hogs, and Hurricanes
We pray before we race
Cheer fourteen and forty-eight
We drink ice-cold beer on Friday nights
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right

We're all across the map
Down city streets and old dirt roads
We're the fabric of this nation
And we're a nation on our own

We're Mountaineers, We're Volunteers
We're Devils, Heels, and Rebels
Fighting Irish and Cavaliers
We supe up our Chevrolets
Cheer twenty-four and eighty-eight
And we crank up the same songs Friday night
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right


I never thought that this is where I'd settle down
I thought I'd die an old man back in my hometown
They gave me this plot of land, me and some other men
For a job well done
There's a big white house sits on a hill just up the road
The man inside, he cried the day they brought me home
They folded up a flag, and told my mom and dad
We're proud of your son


And I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property
I'm on sacred ground and I'm in the best of company
I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done
I can rest in peace, I'm one of the chosen ones, I made it to Arlington


I remember daddy brought me here when I was eight
We searched all day to find out where my granddad lay
And when we finally found that cross
He said, "Son, this is what it costs to keep us free"
Now here I am a thousand stones away from him
He recognized me on the first day I came in
And it gave me a chill, when he clicked his heels
And saluted me


And I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property
I'm on sacred ground and I'm in the best of company
And I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done
I can rest in peace, I'm one of the chosen ones, I made it to Arlington


And everytime I hear, twenty-one guns
I know they brought another hero home, to us


We're thankful for those thankful for the things we've done
We can rest in peace, 'cause we are the chosen ones
We made it to Arlington
Yeah dust to dust, don't cry for us
We made it to Arlington

Door gets slammed, heart gets broke
Watch some dream go up in smoke
Real bad luck, real bad joke
And these are the days you live through

You lay your head on your pillow at night
Work's too hard, money's too tight
And you're not really sure it's gonna be alright
These are the days you live through

Just tryin' to get to
One of those moments, one of those moments

That first home run, that first set of keys
That little bitty ring down on one knee
You know that you will never be the same anymore
That honeymoon night, that drugstore test
When they lay that newborn on your chest
These are the days, these are the days you live for

We all fall down, we get back up
Drinkin' sweet and bitter from the very same cup
And you wonder if all you've got's enough
These are the days you live through

So you hold on tight and you hold your breath
You're freefallin' when you're scared to death
And you're on your way, but you're not there yet
These are the days you live through
Just tryin' to get to

That first home run, that first set of keys
That little bitty ring down on one knee
You know that you will never be the same anymore
That honeymoon night, that drugstore test
When they lay that newborn on your chest
These are the days, these are the days you live for

That first home run, that first set of keys
That first little kiss when you close your eyes
And you fall in love and you talk all night
You know that you will never be the same anymore

When you see yourself in your baby's face
And you finally understand "Amazing Grace"
These are the days, these are the days you live for
These are the days you live for


Mm hmm


I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in your touch
I know that you're scared
But you've never been this loved (mm hmm)
It's a long shot, baby
I know it's true
But if anyone can make it
I'm betting on me and you. (mm hmm)
Just keep on moving into me
I know you're going to see
The best is yet to come


And don't fear it now
We're going all the way
That sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But we're never giving up
Because I know we've got a once in a lifetime love


Everybody's looking
For what we've found
Some wait their whole life
And it never comes around (Uu huh)
So don't hold back now
Just let go of all you've ever known
You can put your hand in mine


And don't fear it now
We're going all the way
That sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But we're never giving up
Because I know we've got a once in a lifetime love


I close my eyes and I see you standing right there
Saying I do and they're throwing the rice in our hair
Well the first one's born
And a brother comes along
And he's got your smile
I've been looking back on the life we had
I'm still by your side


And don't fear it now
We're going all the way
That sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But we're never giving up
Because I know we've got a once in a lifetime love

Lately I've been runnin' into our old friends
Somewhere in the small talk
Someone always asks where you've been
So I tell 'em what you told me
And they can't believe we're through
They ask me what I'm doing now
And in case you're wondering too

I breathe in, I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out

Now I've got every reason
To find someone new
Cause you swore up and down to me
That I've seen the last of you
But the way that you loved me
Left me hopin' and holdin' on
So until this world stops turnin' round
And my heart believes that you're gone

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Til you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out

Yes we were meant to be
Girl there's no doubt
And if it takes the rest of my life
For you to figure it out

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, Oh, I'll breathe in, and breathe out


Cops showed up at a eleven oh six
With the FBI and their black Crown Vics
Cuffed coach Martin with his face in the ground
Neighbors say he got off a couple a rounds
Hundred thousand dollars in an old suitcase
He had a green house in his crawl space


When the lights come on in a sleepy little town
There ain't no secrets when the truth comes out
And everybody knows cause the word gets 'round
When the lights come on in a sleepy little town


Stereotypical preachers wife
Everybody loved her she was so nice
Never told a soul about the things he did
'Till she took a bottle to the back of his head
They say she simply told 911
"Now he deserved what I just done"


When the lights come on in a sleepy little town
There ain't no secrets when the truth comes out
And everybody knows cause the word gets around
When the lights come on in a sleepy little town
Woah ooh oh oh oh sleepy little town


Now everyones proud of Mary Lou
She had a full ride to a private school
Gonna be a doctor or a lawyer someday
She's 17 and three months late
We all thought that she'd never been kissed but
She doesn't know who the daddy is


When the lights come on in a sleepy little town
There ain't no secrets when the truth comes out
And everybody knows cause the word gets around
When the lights come on in a sleepy little town
Woah ooh oh oh oh, Woah ooh oh oh oh, Woah ooh oh oh oh sleepy little town
Woah ooh oh oh oh, Woah ooh oh oh oh, Woah ooh oh oh oh sleepy little town
Woah ooh oh oh oh, woah ooh oh ooh, sleepy little town


Hey girl, you make me wanna write a song
Sit you down, I'll sing it to you all night long
I've had a melody in my head since she walked in here and knocked me dead
Yeah girl, you make me wanna write a song


And it goes like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby all around you
And it goes like hey, girl I'm blown away
Yeah it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah it goes like this


Hey girl, you make me wanna drive you home
Get you outta here and get you all alone

But I'm all messed up and it might sound crazy
But you make me wanna write a song

To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby all around you
And it goes like hey, girl I'm blown away

Lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Makes me wanna grab my old guitar and play


Something like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on my heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby all around you
And it goes like hey, girl I'm blown away
Yeah it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah it goes like this


And it goes like ooh, and it goes like hey
And it ends with a kiss
Yeah it goes like this


I don't really care 'bout making any plans
Leave it up in the air, give it up to chance
Seein' where it goes, seein' where it lands
I just wanna go as fast as we can


And we could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Yeah, all I wanna do is end up with you


To the end of the world if you wanted to
Yeah, 'cause you could light up the dark side of the moon
Don't leave it up to me, I'll leave it up to you
'Cause I just want one thing when the night is through, yeah


We could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Yeah, all I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you


We could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you


End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you

All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you, you, you, you

I had to pack it up
I just wasn't worth a dime today
Boss won't miss me much:
Hell, I wasn't really there anyway
I been lost in your arms an' your touch an' your kiss
Since I left you at six a.m
'Cause that's the kinda love I'm in
That's the kinda love I'm in

I was makin' good time:
Couldn't wait to get here to you
Oh, man I was flyin'
When my front went right in a right back blue
And I probably shoulda stopped
Probably looked like a fool tearin' up these $400 rims
But that's the kinda love I'm in
That's the kinda love I'm in

An' nobody's ever wanted nobody
The way I want you
An' there's somethin' 'bout every little thing about you:
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
Wanna stand for you, fall for you, live for you, die for you:
Don't want you out from under my skin
'Cause that's the kinda love I'm in
That's the kinda love I'm in

I can't turn it off
Why would I if I could?
Man, I love the thought
Of you on my mind for good
And bearin' my soul with the truth like this
Might be steppin' out there, too far on a limb
But that's the kinda love I'm in

'Cause nobody's ever wanted nobody
The way I want you
An' there's somethin' 'bout every little thing about you:
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
Wanna stand for you, fall for you, live for you, die for you:
Don't want you out from under my skin
'Cause that's the kinda love I'm in
That's the kinda love I'm in
That's the kinda love I'm in
That's the kinda love

When I gave you my heart
It was not what you wanted
Now the walls say your name
And the pictures are haunted

Does my ring burn your finger?
Did my love weigh you down?
Was a promise too much to keep around?

I remember your words
And I can't keep from crying
I could never believe
That your kisses were lying

Was there something from the past
Buried in a shallow grave?
Did you think that it was too far gone to save?

Please tell me baby
Please tell me now
You say that I should just go on
Now please tell me how

Now its just me and the night
And I'm so broken hearted
I just wait in the dark here
For my dearly departed

Did my ring burn your finger?
Did my love weigh you down?
Was a promise too much to keep around?


Hey there Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart
Everytime you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breaking
You'd never want a heart

Oo-oo
Oo-oo
Oo


Hey there Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me darling
You don't want a heart

Oo-oo
Oo-oo
Oo


Hey there Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart

Oo-oo
Oo-oo
Oo

You and me baby, can meet for the weekend
To solidify all our plans
We'll follow a jet stream to some place exotic
All in the name of romance

Cause we're still young and in love
And we just believe
We can be strong and do anything
If we dare to dream
All in the name of romance...
'cause

We're sill young and in love
And we just believe
We can be strong and do anything
If we dare to dream

We'll find a place on a cliff by the ocean
And pay a couple months' rent
I'll sell my paintings down by the board walk
So we'll have money to spend...

We're still young and in love
And we just believe
We can be strong and do anything
If we dare to dream

Dare to dream, take it to the extreme
Let your heart and soul lead the way
Live, Love, seize the day and
Dare to dream, dare to dream, dare to dream

Don't try to stop us don't tell us we're crazy
You're only wasting your breath
We're bound and determined to make it all happen
It's just a matter of when
'cause

We're still young and in love
And we just believe
We can be strong and do anything
If we dare to dream


Tricycles, Bicycles
Candy canes and candlelight
Trying to stay awake all night
To catch a glimpse of Santa's reindeer
Mama baking, sister making
Angels in the falling snow
Now it seems so long ago
I wish they all were here


We'd have an old time Christmas
An old time Christmas
Just like the ones from yesterday
We'd leave the world behind us
Let the spirit find us
And have an old time Christmas
For old times’ sake


Friends singing, bells ringing
Snowman standing in the yard
It's a living Christmas card
Captured in our hearts forever
Friends scatter, it's won't matter
The magic never melts away
It only takes a Christmas Day
To make it reappear




So leave the world behind you
Let the spirit find you
And have an old time Christmas
For old time’s sake


Girl I've never seen you in this town
If you need somebody to show you around
Well, I know somebody
It's a little too loud to talk in here
And your eyes are saying you wanna disappear
Well, I know a place and
I know somebody


Somebody with a gassed up truck
Sitting right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody
And you're looking right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody)
I know somebody (I know somebody)


I'm loving the way you act so shy
Like you ain't so sure
Like you can't decide
But I heard you tell your friends
That you know somebody
That makes you laugh
That can get you home
That might make you fall ‘fore the night is gone
So come on, you know
I'm that somebody
Yeah


Somebody with a gassed up truck
Sitting right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody
And you're looking right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody)
I know somebody (I know somebody)


I know somebody
That's looking for a girl like you
Could fall in a kiss or two
Baby tell me what you wanna do
Cause I know


Somebody with a gassed up truck
Sitting right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody
And you're looking right in his eyes

Someday I'm going to be famous, do I have talent, well no
These days you don't really need it thanks to reality shows
Can't wait to date a supermodel, can't wait to sue my dad
Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari on my way to rehab


Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
You can act just like a fool
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV
I can throw a major fit
When my latte isn't just how I like it
When they say I've gone insane
I'll blame it on the fame
And the pressures that go with
Being a celebrity


I'll get to cry to Barbara Walters when things don't go my way
And I'll get community service no matter which law I break
I'll make the supermarket tabloids, they'll write some awful stuff
But the more they run my name down the more my price goes up


Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV
I can fall in and out of love
Have marriages that barely last a month
When they go down the drain
I'll blame it on the fame
And say it's just so tough
Being a celebrity


So let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
To the land of the fun and the sun
We'll be real world bachelor jackass millionaires
Hey hey, Hollywood, here we come


Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV
Being a celebrity
Yeah celebrity

Standing there with her arms around no one
No one who'd die for her right where he stands
Looking around like she's looking for someone
Looking like she's got time on her hands
Funny how much you can see in someone
Across the room who you don't even know
Telling you things she would tell to no one
Taking you places she's wanted to go

Like a walk in the rain, a place in the sun
With a lifetime of love that has only begun
Doing all of the things only lovers can do
My imagination is running away with you

Walking away and I'm walking beside her
Into forever here in my mind
Deraming a dream that we're dreaming together
Finding the things only lovers can find

Like a walk on the moon, a dance in the stars
With a love light that finds us wherever we are
And our own happy ending will always come true
My imagination is running away with you

As fast as I can running straight to your heart
Where the fantasy ends and reality starts
'Til I stop believing that dreaming is all I can do
And the fantasy might even come true

My imagination
It's only my imagination running away with you...


I'm gonna wear you down
I'm gonna make you see
I'm gonna get to you
You're gonna give in to me
I'm gonna start a fire
You're gonna feel the heat
I'm gonna burn for you
You're gonna melt for me


Come on, come on
Into my arms
Come on, come on
Give in to me


You're gonna take my hand
Whisper the sweetest words
And if you're ever sad
I'll make you laugh
I'll chase the hurt
My heart is set on you
I don't want no one else
And if you don't want me
I guess i'll be all by myself




I'll use my eyes to draw you in
Until i'm under your skin
I'll use my lips, i'll use my arms
Come on, come on, come on
Give in to me


Give in to me 


Got a call from a friend
Said "you should come over
All your friends are already over"
Took you 20 minutes just to find a dress
You like the dress, you say yes
Green, red, yellow, blue
Yeah, they're all just right on you
Don't worry, you look beautiful
Hair up, hair down
Another 20 minutes to get out the house
Call a cab and we jump in it


Finally walk in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes that you like so much
Everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you


I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go


Wall to wall
Way too many people
The noise, the crowd
I don't even see 'em
Cause I'm talking to you, you're talking to me
I'm not tryin' to be antisocial
Everybody's probably wondering why we're standing in the corner all alone
Girl, you're so beautiful, yeah
You look good in the lights, but I wanna see you in the dark
Kiss your lips, it's only been a minute since


We walked in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes you like so much
And everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you


I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go, go


We're halfway out the door
I can't wait anymore


Yeah, I know we just walked in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes you like so much
And everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you


I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go, go
Ready to go
I'm already ready to go
Ready to go

He had me spinning like a girl in the circus in a trapeze act
Tell me what are you supposed to do when you've been kissed like that
I don't think I've ever been so high
Is it any wonder I felt like I could fly

It's a tumblin' rush it's a helpless kind of feeling
When your heart doesn't know which way is up or down
'Til you hit the ground hard and fast, bruised & barely breathin'
I guess they call it falling for a reason

I was death defying, yeah, flying with the greatest of ease
There was nothing out there but the wind and the air and me
It's a long way down I don't know how I survived
It's a hell of a way to feel like you're alive

It's a tumblin' rush it's a helpless kind of feeling
When your heart doesn't know which way is up or down
'Til you hit the ground hard and fast, bruised & barely breathin'
I guess they call it falling for a reason

Falling
I don't think I've ever been so high
Is it any wonder I felt like I could fly

It's a tumblin' rush it's a helpless kind of feeling
When your heart doesn't know which way is up or down
'Til you hit the ground hard and fast, bruised & barely breathin'
I guess they call it falling for a reason
They call it falling for a reason
Falling


Every day I drive to work across Flint River Bridge
A hundred yards from the spot
Where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand
On the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peeling peaches
If it was twenty years ago
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him


If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away


I'd hug all three of those girls
We lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo
And take him hunting one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of
"Me and Bobby McGee"
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile


If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far


If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far away
So far away
So far away


I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to


I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time


And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes


I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time


I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you


I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time


What if I told you about my little nothing town
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now


What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith?
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there's no fixing me
Cause everybody's already tried


Would you stay? Would you leave?
I could wait, it'll all come out eventually


If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Would you look the other way, could you love me anyway?


What if I told you I don't plan on staying here?
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family's gonna want you to stay
You know what? I don't blame them


So I'll say what I don't want to
And I'll just pray you want what I do


If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way, could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway


So before we go any further here
Better we turn into another year
There's some things you probably don't want to hear
But you have to


If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me?
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl, if that's what this is I don't want to let it slip away
Could you love me anyway, please?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway?


Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine


And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you


'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours


So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours


The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

CHORUS:
Look at me, can't believe
I finally made it here
Feeling like I'm where I belong
Singing my hallelujah song

Hard to find, took some time
But I think that I might be hittin'
On what's been missing all along
Singing my hallelujah song

It's a highway sliding through a Sunday afternoon
It's a snapshot smiling like we ain't got nothing to lose
It's the peace in knowing that love is gonna be gone someday
But you only get more when you give it away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's a sweet pray knowing someones up there hearing you. Define punch lines take a little time, but im getting it. Life is more than just how many breaths you take, but the moments that take your breath away. Baby take my breath away

Look at me, can't believe
I finally made it here
Feeling like I'm where I belong
Singing my hallelujah song

Hard to find, took some time
But I never was by myself
There were angels helping all along
Singing my hallelujah song

My hallelujah
My hallelujah
Singing my hallelujah song


Hung my cotton dress on rusted wire
Up there on Pilahatchee Bridge
Just a crazy roughneck's daughter
Jumped head-first into the water
Baptized away my sins
Hitched to town with Bobby Jo and Tommy
Couple of lookers, new best friends
We slipped in the back of Sunday service
Know them church ladies, they heard us
Bum smoke money from the offering


Mama said, "Idle hands are Devil's handiwork
Oh, the trouble you'll get into
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do"
Yeah!


Sign read 'Bait, Chips, Beer and Ammunition'
That Slim-Jim bag boy hadn't a prayer
Well, I hiked my skirt and did the talkin'
While them boys were busy walkin'
Case of .5 out the back door
Hid deep in the Mississippi backwoods
We danced and played around 'til dark
Well, I had them wrestlin' for my first kiss
Turned into a fight and they missed
Me speedin' off in Tommy's car


Mama said, "Idle hands are Devil's handiwork
Oh, the trouble you'll get into
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do"
Yeah!


Nobody hurt, nobody harmed
Nobody's business but my own
Mama said, "Idle hands are Devil's handiwork
Oh, the trouble you'll get into"


You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, babe, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, babe, you got nothin' better to do, no no
Got nothin' better to do, babe, you got nothin' better to do, no no
Got nothin' better to do, babe, you got nothin' better to do, no no!


Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man


Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
Ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
I cannot compete with you, Jolene


He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
You don't know what he means to me, Jolene


Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can


Well, you could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene


Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Oh, I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Oh, please don't take him even though you can
Oh, please don't take him even though you can
Oh, Jolene

Cheap sunglasses and a ball cap backwards
Standin' in the summer sun, toes in the sand and a July tan
Oh, baby tell me what's not to love
Your momma didn't like me or the way that you loved me

She prayed it was a summer thing
You thought I was wild
And I didn't say it at the time
But you're my first time for everything

But there's nothin' I'd change about those days
You're the sweetest thing about my past
There's a part of me
That hopes you found your dreams

And you're happy wherever you're at
There's a part of me that wants that summer back

We burned both ends of that beach town
Till they shut down the middle way
We tried to hold on but that warm breeze was blowin'
Yeah, Fall changed everything

But there's nothin' I'd change about those days
You're the sweetest thing about my past
There's a part of me
That hopes you found your dreams

And you're happy wherever you're at
There's a part of me that wants that summer back

There's a picture of you and me I keep
It reminds me that we were real
Girl I sure do miss that beach
And the way that you made me feel

But there's nothin' I'd change about those days
You're the sweetest thing about my past
There's a part of me that hopes you found your dreams
And you're happy wherever you're at

There's a part of me that wants that summer
There's a part of me still wants that summer
There's a part of me that wants that summer back
I want that summer back baby, oooh


Baby, you and me been getting along for way too long
Life's been a bed of roses and sweet, sweet song
I know I should not complain
This is gonna sound insane, but


Let's fight, let's cuss, get mad, throw stuff
Maybe call each other names
Slam doors, break glass, I'll leave, come back
And I'll take all the blame
Let's scream, let's shout
Make up, make out
Baby, just for tonight
Let's fight


You might think that I might think you've lost your mind

A love like the one we've got's so

Hard to find
But I miss those crazy nights too
I tend to agree with you


Let's fight, let's cuss, get mad, throw stuff
Maybe call each other names
Slam doors, break glass, I'll leave, come back
And I'll take all the blame
Let's scream, let's shout
Make up, make out
Baby just for tonight
Let's fight

Baby let's fight



Don't wanna do what we always do

Five o'clock dinner, six o'clock news

Baby roll up your sleeves

And put up your dukes

Let's fight, baby let's fight

Baby let's fight



Let's fight, let's cuss, get mad, throw stuff
Maybe call each other names
Slam doors, break glass, I'll leave, come back
And I'll take all the blame
Let's scream, let's shout
Make up, make out
Baby just for tonight
Let's fight



Baby let's fight
 Scream and shout, make up, make out
 Baby let's fight
 Slam doors, break glass, I'll leave, come back
 Baby let's fight

"The first words I spoke in the original phonograph, Mary had a little lamb. It s fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. " - THOMAS EDISON

"The Distinguished Flying Cross upon Colonel Charles A. Lindberg"

(He made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean on May 20, 1927. He took off from Roosevelt Field on Long Island, New York and landed near Paris, France. The flight took thirty three and a half hours. Of course, he had to be awake the entire time, and alert enough to pilot a plane.)
"Today, paniced investors ordered their brokers to sell at whatever the price in the stock market crashed."
(In October, 1929, an over-valued stock market, with many owning shares purchased "on margin" or with borrowed money, crashed. Numerous men committed suicide rather than face bankruptcy. In response, the U.S. Government imposed stringent rules on the buying and selling of stocks. These make it less likely that a similar catastrophic devaluation could occur now. The insurance companies began to exclude suicide as an acceptable cause of death for life insurance policies and/or wrote in a two year waiting period before benefits could be paid.)

(Live radio account of the fire and crash of the German airship "Hindenburg." It happened 5/6/37 on the eve of the Second World War in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The Hindenburg was the largest airship ever built. It was filled with an enormous quantity of hydrogen. Hydrogen had two big advantages over helium. It had greater lifting potential and was much cheaper. Unfortunately, it is one of the most flammable substances in the world. Helium could be used to put fires out. Since that disaster all airships have been filled with hydrogen. This luxurious craft had just come from Europe, making the trip across the Atlantic Ocean much faster than any ship. It was the pride of Nazi Germany. It s loss was a blow to the morale of the German engineers. The German public never heard much about it. The exact cause of the fire and crash has never been determined.)

(confirming the assassination in Dallas, Texas on 11/22/63)

"Lee Harvey Oswald was shot."
(His death at the hands of Jack Ruby prevented any clear resolution of this crime. Numerous conspiracy theories have evolved because of this lack of information. When you see notorious criminals going to and from jail, with armed guards, wearing body armor themselves, this is where it started. As much as many would like to see these animals die, protecting them until the judicial process is completed is common practice.)

(He became President following the assassination of President John Kennedy. Civil rights was a major goal for Kennedy, but he would not likely have had the same success that Johnson did. Johnson was able to pass this legislation becuase he was from the South (Texas). He had been Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate and knew how to get things through Congress. In addition, he apparently would do whatever was necessary to get what he wanted.)

"That s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." - ASTRONAUT NEIL ARMSTRONG

"There s a drive into left center field. That ball is gonna be, out of here. It s gone. It s 715. There s a new home run champion of all time and it s Henry Aaron."
(There was substantial sentiment against Aaron because he was Black. Death threats were made and were taken seriously. After the home run his mother ran onto the field and hugged her son. She later said that one of the reasons she did this was to shield him from a possible assassin.)

"I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the Presidency."- SENATOR DAN QUAYLE
(Vice Presidential candidate)

"Senator, you re no Jack Kennedy." - SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN of Texas

(In the televised debate between Vice Presidential candidates, it is hard to imagine how any speech writer could have made such a disastrous blunder. For the young, inexperienced, not-to-bright Quayle to refer to the revered former President so casually as "Jack" was not appropriate. Comparing himself to Kennedy was beyond laughable.)
"Mr. Gorbachov, tear down this wall." - PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN

Oh, look there you go again, puttin' on that smile again
Even though I know you've had a bad day
Doin' this  an' doin' that, always puttin' yourself last
A whole lotta give and not enough take


But you can only be strong so long before you break


So, fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine, I'll catch you
Every time you...
Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear

And if you wanna let go, baby, it's okay


Fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine, I'll catch you

Every time you...
Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear

Baby fall


Yeah we got drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
Takin' pictures of people we thought were stars
It’s easy to give in to your heart
When you’re drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
When the song comin' out of the speakers
Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were …


Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire


Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier
Said "Do you think we’ll live forever?" As we killed another beer
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were laughin' until we were breathless
Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless
And comin' alive and we were…


Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire


Oh, yeah, yeah


Yeah, we were up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire


World all  on fire
We were setting
The world all on fire
We were setting
The world all on fire
World all on fire

Well, I've been a strong-willed son of a gun
Ever since I was suckin' my thumb
But push came to shove
When I fell in love with my baby

Yeah, my baby

Well, you could say she's over bearin'
In fact, she picked out the clothes that I'm wearin'
And I can't go fishin'
Without her permission, but I ain't complainin'

We got an arrangement

She can wear the pants, she can run the show
She can crack a whip like Indiana Jones
She can rule the roost, she can snap and holler
She can wear the pants as long as I can take 'em off her

Long as I can take 'em off her

She calls the shots, gives the orders, makes the plans
That woman's wish is my command
Yeah, I'm telling you
I've got more honey-do's than a fruit truck on 40

But I'll get 'em done shortly

She can wear the pants, she can run the show
She can crack a whip like Indiana Jones
She can rule the roost, she can snap and holler
She can wear the pants as long as I can take 'em off her

Well, she can push me around
But when the sun goes down
Look out, there's a new sheriff in town

Well, I get a whole lot of flak from the fellas
But I reckon that they're just jealous

She can wear the pants, she can run the show
She can crack a whip like Indiana Jones
She can rule the roost, she can snap and holler
She can wear the pants as long as I can take 'em off her

Long as I can take 'em off her
Yeah, long as I can take 'em off her
Long as I can take 'em off her


Well, I got some Coke in my bourbon
Surfin' the room like Swazye
No, I ain't drunk, I'm amazin'
Yeah, I got that laid way, way back, back in my swagger
X-Factor, feelin' no pain, I'm at the top of my game


Darlin', you can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't start rainin' on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)


Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me


Guess you don't know what you want
'Til you see 'em movin' on
Making lonely look like freedom
Baby, don't even act like I'm doing something wrong
If my song comes on and I get lost on that dance floor
In somebody's arms that ain't yours


You can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't start raining on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

It is what it is, girl, you did whatcha did, girl
I'm just doin' what a bachelor do


Darlin', you can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't be raining on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)


Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold

But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

You broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe?
You broke up with me

In the late great golden state
It's getting hard to negotiate
When you're one slip
From a grim fate
In the late great golden state

In the late great golden state
I don't do much
But I'm always late
I ain't old, I'm just out of date
In the late great golden state

I caught one last glimpse
Of a palomino
When I drove out west
To see the purple sage
Then as canyons burned
And the mountains crumbled
The last cowboy band
Left the stage

I ain't old, I'm just out of date
In the late great golden state

Solo

I caught one last glimpse
Of a palomino
When I drove out west
To see the purple sage
Then as the canyons burned
And the mountains crumbled
The last cowboy band
Left the stage

Yeah, the late great golden state
Is a nice place for a clean slate
But leave your expectations
At the gate
Of the late great golden state
Cause they can pack you up
And send you home in a crate
Stamped the late great
Golden state

Two in the mornin', telephone rings
Somehow I knew it who was
Cause baby it's always the same old thing
When you need my love

You say it's over again and again
This time you've had enough
Girl, I know you've been fightin' with him
When you need my love

Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have someplace to go
When your world falls apart

He'll call tomorrow with the same old lines
And you'll forget about us
And I'll be lonely until the next time
When you need my love

Chorus:
Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have someplace to go
When your world falls apart

Now someday, someone's gonna love me true
And baby when she does
Then I wonder what you're gonna do
When you need my love

Yeah then I wonder what you're gonna do
When you need my love

When you need my love

When you need my love
What are you gonna do
Ohhhhh


She was storming through the house that day
And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought, aw, she'll be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall an said


That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said, give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where so much love was made
Just give it away
She said, just give it away


Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth Fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
So just give it away


So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm


When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said, give it away
Just give it away
And I said, now, honey, don't you even want
Your half of everything
She said, give it away
Just give it away






So I'm still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She don't care about anymore
Mmm, like that picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where all our love was made
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away


I've got a furnished house, a diamond ring
And a lonely broken heart
Full of love and I can't even give it away

The clouds are partin
The summer suns startin to burn down on that river
My babys waitin
I got the chevy shaking
Im blazing a trail to get her
There she is
Shes got her shades on
& man shes lookin strong
Mine all mine for the weekend
The coolers loaded down
We're headed outta town
Jumpin off the deep end
Goin barefoot and crazy
Me and my baby
Backflip off the flipright bridge
Double dog dare me and I will
Meet me at the bottom with a cool wet kiss
Shes rockin that bikini top
My hearts skippin like a rock across that water
Don't ever wanna stop
Goin barefoot and crazy
The sun is droppin
We got the fire poppin &
Its lightin up her blue eyes
With a little bit of luck
It'll heat things up &
We'll be lovin in the moonlight
Break out my old guitar
Sing fishin in the dark
Baby get ready
We'll take a little sip
We'll take a little dip &
Sleep in the bed of my Chevy
Goin barefoot and crazy
Me and my baby
Just me & her & the man in the moon
Drinkin on a cold bud brew

Do it all again
Wishin it would never end
Anybody asks where we've been

Barefoot and crazy

Double dog dared me and I did
Met me at the bottom with a cool wet kiss
Shes rockin that bikini top
My hearts skippin like a rock across that water
Don't ever wanna stop
Goin barefoot and crazy
Don't ever wanna stop
Don't ever wanna stop
Goin barefoot and crazy

Dear Santa, I need to change my Christmas list
There's one big thing I missed
You see my Daddy's working, far away from here
And you know Santa, I asked for a Barbie doll
And a brand new soccer ball
But I'd trade it all, for just one gift this year...

Bring him home Santa, bring him home to mom and me
Let us wake up Christmas morning, and find him standing by our tree
You can pick him up on your way, he could ride there in your sleigh
Don't make him spend Christmas all alone
Bring him home

And Santa, here's a picture that I drew
Of him in his dress blues
Mama says our country, needs him over there
And you know Santa, this whole year I have been good
I was hopin' that you would
Do all you could, to answer her prayer...

Bring him home Santa, bring him home to mom and me
Let us wake up Christmas morning, and find him standing by our tree
You can pick him up on your way, he could ride there in your sleigh
Don't make him spend Christmas all alone
Bring him home

Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home

The sun is setting on a hard day's work
Sure feels good to get 'er all done
Washed off the sweat, the hay and the dirt
Now it's time to have some fun
I'll go meet Amy at the Dixie Dog
Get a #3 and a Coke float
Make the drag, then later on
We'll head down to the cove

(Chorus)
Back up the pickup, right up to the lake
Throw a blanket on the tailgate
Listen to the bullfrog
Serenade in the moonlight
In the truck bed dancin' slow
We'll sing along with the radio
Sippin' on Grandma's home made wine
Livin' the good life

There's a cottonwood tree
With a limb hangin' over
We'll do the cannonball off a rope swing
She can dry her clothes out by the fire
I swear I won't peek
I'll be wishin' that
The night could last forever
As I'm looking into her doe eyes
Ride back home with her head on my shoulder
Can't wait till next time


I was hanging' out a last night at the top cat when the band slowed down to Merle
Man I hit it 'cross the bar room trying to find my baby girl
Some drunk tried to punk me, and ask my baby "do you dance" she said "yes I do, but not with you, I'm waiting' on my man"


See every dog has it's day dog, when the big dog throws him a bone
One moment in the sunshine when your ducks lined up in a row
Lucky dog get a big ol' bed, stray dog gets the porch
Every dog has it's day dog, but today dog just ain't yours


Well I flipped her around and I kissed her and she said lets do one more
And we were half way through a two step when he stepped out on the floor
He jerked me back and said "im cutting' in, girl lets docent do" she doubled up her fist and caught him right square on the nose


Every dog has it's day dog, when the big dog throws him a bone
One moment in the sunshine when the ducks line up in a row

Every dog has it's day dog, but today dog just ain't yours


I'm not talking smack, you know there's no pity, pity
Tryna put in words that you understand
You don't call her back, you think it's no biggie, biggie
Seconds on the clock, you need a touch down


Thought you had a shot, you were good to go
There's never three strikes in love, you know
When she gets mad, it ain't gon' be pretty, pretty
Won't see it coming, it's like a curve ball


You think you're doing just fine
But ooh, she got you on the sideline
You think you're flying towards the endzone
You're just headed towards the friend zone


Let me break it down to the facts
You will never get a girl like that
You gotta step up to the plate with a bat
That's all I gotta say about that


Yeah, you gotta take her out, spend a little money, money
Show her she's worth more than 3.99
No room for doubt, I'm not being funny, honey
Tell her how you feel, she can't read your mind


Thought you had it on lock, you were good to go
But there's never three strikes in love, we know
I'mma help a brother out, it ain't gon' be sunny, sunny
You commit the crime, you're gonna do time


You think you're doing just fine
But ooh, she got you on the sideline
You think you're flying towards the in-zone
You're just headed towards the friend zone


Let me break it down to the facts (just a facts)

Bass and the beat and my banjo
Bass and the beat and my banjo

Friend zone
You're just headed towards the friend zone

Bare feet hangin' off a tire swing
Cotton dress barely hangin' onto me
Settin' sun coolin' down the August heat
Sweet magnolia in the air

Lazy old river just floatin' by
That boy was givin' me the eye
Riverbank wasn't quite dry
Standin' at the water's edge
He said, "Girl, come over here"

I felt it movin' underneath my toes
Soakin' in all over my clothes
We were laughin' when he pulled me close
And my heart went thump, thump, thump

He had a little bit on his lips
When he gave me that first kiss
But it was perfect just the way it was
Back then, me and him, big grins, covered in
That Georgia mud

Think it took a good two days
To wash all that dirt away
Another two years to forget his face
And love faded like it will
But every now and then I'd still

Feel it movin' underneath my toes
Soakin' in all over my clothes
We were laughin' when he pulled me close
And my heart went thump, thump, thump

He had a little bit on his lips
When he gave me that first kiss
It was perfect just the way it was
Back then, me and him, big grins, covered in
That Georgia mud, ooh yeah

I felt it moving underneath my toes
Soakin' in all over my clothes
Well, it was hard to take it slow
When my heart went thump, thump, thump

Had a little bit on his lips
I gotta say I didn't mind a bit
It was perfect just the way it was
Back then, me and him, big grins, mmm

Back then, me and him, big grins, covered in
That Georgia mud
Well, that Georgia mud
Ooh yeah


I recognized your number
It's burned into my brain
Felt my heart beating faster
Every time it rang
Some things never change
That's why I didn't answer


I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a country song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, "No more alcohol"
I bet you're in a bar
Cause I'm always your last call


I don't need to check that message
I know what it says
"Baby, I still love you"
Don't mean nothing when there's whiskey on your breath
That's the only love I get
So if you're calling...


I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a cheatin' song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, "No more alcohol"
I bet you're in bar
Cause I'm always your last


Call me crazy but
I think maybe
We've had our last call


I bet you're in a bar
It's always the same old song
That Johnny Walker Red
By now it's almost gone
But baby, I won't be there
To catch you when you fall
I bet you're in bar
Cause I'm always your last call

I know your heart belongs to me and you're afraid
'cause I haven't given mine
You think that I don't want you to have it
But I do, I just got hurt real bad one time

Can you wait until I find my heart
I hid it well back then
It was so broken I didn't think I'd need it again
Never dreamed I'd find someone so true
Can you wait until I find my heart
If you can, I'll give it to you

It's here somewhere
So lost, so long I can't recall
The place that it would be
I'm sure by now there's times you ask yourself
How long that you can wait for me

Can you wait until I find my heart
I hid it well back then
It was so broken I didn't think I'd need it again
Never dreamed I'd find someone so true
Can you wait until I find my heart
If you can, I'll give it to you

Can you wait until I find my heart


Me and Charlie boy used to go walking, sitting in the woods behind my house
When being lovers meant a stolen kiss and holding hands with nobody else around
Charlie said he wanted to get married but we were only ten so we'd have to wait
He said we'd never let our love run dry like so many do these days


So you treat your love like a firefly, like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar with holes in the top and run like hell to show it off
Oh, promises were made when we'd go walking, that's just me and Charlie talking


Charlie always said he'd like to leave here, so he turned eighteen and he left our sleepy town
Letters came and went and I kept waiting for Charlie to come back and bring the life he'd found
Funny how time and distance change you the road you take don't always lead you home
You can start a love with good intentions and then you look up and it's gone




Now and then I sometimes think of Charlie and how we thought we knew it all back then
Now I'd give anything to feel love from a child's heart again




La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star above the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star above the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

My name ain't up in lights
But I'm a hero in this bar
And I play four big shows a night
With just me and my guitar
I don't make a lot of money
And I don't have a lot of gear
I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

If you wanna hear Bob Dillon
I'll play like a Rollin' Stone
If you wanna hear Bob Wills
I'll play the Rose of San Antone
I'll even play Happy Birthday
If that's what you wanna hear
Cause I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

So it's hey hey what's your favorite song?
Hey hey everybody sing along
We're just one big red neck family
Aw, at least while we're in here
Cause I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

I wake every Sunday morning'
So I can go to church and pray
But after some of my Saturday nights
Things just don't turn out that way
I think even the Good Lord, he understands
I'm at that point in my career
Where I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

So it's hey hey what's your favorite song?
Hey hey everybody sing along
We're just one big red neck family
Aw, at least while we're in here
Cause I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer


She was pacing back and forth on her front porch
I pulled up slinging gravel in my Daddy's Ford
She cried all the way to Johnson's store
I kept the motor running and parked by the door

Yeah I was foolish and wild
She was classic and regal
We were fresh out of school, both barely legal
We were young and on fire and just couldn't wait
Six weeks in, she was three weeks late

One means none and we're home free
Two means three and a diamond ring
Yeah i wonder what fate is going to decide
We're just sitting around waiting on two pink lines
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines

Yeah her Daddy's going to kill me and that’s a fact
Maybe we'll just leave town and never come back
Or I could stand there and tell him
Face him like a man
Oh who am I kidding, he'll never understand

Yeah that’s second hand just keeps slowing down
I swear it stopped twice the last time around
Yeah we'll know the truth in three minutes time
We're just sitting around waiting on two pink lines
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines

Hot summer nights, whispering her name
Under the blanket by the river bank
Hearts beating fast we never thought twice
But she pulled me close and I held on tight

When the moment of truth finally comes
She gives me a look and then comes undone
She says looks like were lucky
Someone’s smiling down
She grabs her coat and says see ya around

Yeah these days the rabbit doesn't die
You just sit around waiting on two pink lines
Praying that fate is on your side
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines

When I was 16 I knew everything
Opportunity grew on trees
I taste 'em, waste 'em
And do it all again

10 feet tall, invincible, I fell short on principle
A rebellion, a hellion
Yeah, that was me back then

Burned by my mistakes
A phoenix I rose from the flames, now I'm

(Chorus:)
Doin' it right, I saw the light
Sun came up in, The middle of the night
Been doing' it wrong for so long
I sure oughta know what it finally feels like to be
Doin' it right, doin' it, doin' it
Doin' it right

When this fool came tumblin' down
180 degree turn around
Revelation, salvation
Made me what I am

Every day I fight the war
And each day I'm winnin' more, yeah, 'cause I'm

(Chorus:)
Doin' it right, I saw the light
Sun came up in, The middle of the night
Been doing' it wrong for so long
I sure oughta know what it finally feels like to be
Doin' it right, doin' it, doin' it
Doin' it right

(Bridge:)
Every now and then I'm tempted
I don't jump the fences, no, I keep

(Chorus:)
Doin' it right, I saw the light
Sun came up in, The middle of the night
Been doing' it wrong for so long
I sure oughta know what it finally feels like to be
Doin' it right, doin' it, doin' it, a doin' it

Doin' it right, I saw the light
Sun came up in, The middle of the night
Been doing' it wrong for so long
I sure oughta know what it finally feels like
I sure oughta know what it finally feels like
I sure oughta know what it finally feels like to be
Doin' it right, doin' it, doin' it
Doin' it right

Exit 65, Room 232
Its nothing fancy, ain't much of a view
Its no white house with a picket fences
But we close our eyes and pretend
At out home sweet holiday inn
Wish I could keep you
But its out of my hands
It's the best that I can do
I pray you'll understand
How much I love you, god I feel guilty
So I try to make amends
At our home sweet holiday inn

(chorus)
I just get a couple days
To steal you away
Make up for all the time
I missed
And I hope that we can fit it all in
At our home sweet holiday inn
You've grown so fast that
I just can't believe
How much you're changing
But you still look like me
Maybe some day
This will all be different
But baby until then
We've got our home sweet holiday inn

(repeat chorus)
Your daddy loves you
And I'll be dreaming of you
And counting days until I see you again
At our home sweet holiday inn
At our home sweet holiday inn

Man I hate you found me here
Whiskey on my breath
I know I should be ashamed
So much for those twelve steps
He said no my son I know you're doin' your best
With all you been through I understand
I only came to offer you a friend
You know she still asks about you
Wonderin' how you're doin' and where you been

Chorus:
Tell her I'm in Tampa on a cause way
Watchin' the waves roll in
Tell her I'm in Aspen in a cabin
Findin' myself again
Tell her that I'm happy and I've moved on Better than I've every been
Just don't tell her that you saw me
Drownin' in this bottle
Tryin' to make her disappear
Tell her I'm anywhere
Anywhere but here

It would only break her heart
If she knew the truth
You see I told her when she left
This was the last thing I would do
Tomorrow I swear I'm startin' over again
I've made it too far and I know where this ends
But she doesn't have to find out where I am
If you see or hear from her again

Chorus:
Tell her I'm in Baton Rouge Lousianna
Sellin' cars five days a week
Tell her I'm in Mobile Alabama
Gettin' back on my feet
Tell her that I'm happy and I've moved on
Lookin' better than you've ever seen
Just don't tell her that you saw me
Drownin' in this bottle
Tryin' to make her disappear
Tell her I'm anywhere
Anywhere but here

Oh
Tell her that I'm happy and I've moved on
And let her know that I still care
Tell I'm anywhere
Anywhere but here
Tell I'm anywhere

For the longest time, I guess I thought
He didn't give a damn
Hard to read, hard to please
Yeah, that was my old man

On the day I left for college
It was nothing new
We never had that heart-to-heart
He had too much to do

He checked the air in my tires
The belts and all the spark plug wires
Said, "When the hell's the last time
You had this oil changed?"

And as I pulled out the drive
He said, "Be sure and call your mom sometime"
And I didn't hear it then but I hear it now
He was saying, "I love you"
The only way he knew how

120,000 miles
Six years down the road
A brand new life and a brand new wife
We'd just bought our first home

When he finally came to visit
I thought he'd be so proud
He never said he liked the place
He just got his tool belt out

And put new locks on the doors
Went back and forth to the hardware store
Said, "Come and hold this flashlight"
As he crawled beneath the sink

And these old wires ain't up to code
And that circuit box is gonna overload
And I didn't hear it then but I hear it now
He was saying, "I love you"
The only way he knew how

Last Sunday, we all gathered
For his 65th birthday
And I knew he'd stiffen up
But I hugged him anyway

When it was finally time to say goodbye
I knew what was next
Just like he always does
Right before we left

He checked the air in my tires
The belts and all the spark plug wires
Said, "When the hell's the last time
You had this oil changed?"

And as I pulled out the drive
He said, "Be sure and call your mom sometime"
And I didn't hear it then but I hear it now
He was saying, "I love you"
He was saying, "I love you"
The only way he knew how


(It's 'bout that time a year again!)
It was bumper to bumper when I hit that county
So I stopped and let the top down
Speakers where a bumping
Little hip-hop something
I was stirring up a coke and crown
Didn't even check in the room
We went straight for the beach
Didn't even give the ice a chance to melt
Now I'm scouting my spot
Where we were going to rock
With the biggest buzz I ever felt


Now I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching these rays
Watching coconut covered girls


They keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand
(Who!)
Hey there cutie with a Kentucky coozie
Have you ever hung with a Georgia boy?
And why don't you and your friends
Ease on over here and chug a beer with Miss Illinois?


Yea I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching' these rays
Watching coconut covered girls


They keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand


I got to buddy who blew all his money
And he had to stay his broke-ass home
He's been going crazy, blowing up my phone
Wanting to know what’s going on


I tell him I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching these rays
Watching coconut covered girls


And they keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand
(Yeah!)


Sitting pretty, right here in Suntan City

I was on my way to Daytona, I had my race gear in my pack
When a stranger pulled up beside me in a stock car, painted black
He was dressed like a NASCAR driver, moustache with mirrored eyes
Said: "It's a long walk to Florida, would you like a ride, son?"

So I crawled across the roll-cage as he fired that Chevy up
The badge on his sleeve said the man had won seven Winston cups
His eyes were intimidatin', as he rode into the night
An' I knew there was somethin' strange about this ride

He said: "Boy, can you make fans stand an' scream your name?
"Can you hit 'em in the rear an' grab another gear, still roll into victory lane?"
He said: "Boy, do you know how it feels to run three wide?
"'Cause if you're Daytona-bound, let me warn you, you're in for a ride."

Then he cried when we got to Daytona an' as he pulled onto the track
An' he said: "This is where you get out boy, 'cause number three ain't comin' back."
As I crawled out of the race car, I said: "Thanks, I'll catch you later."
He said: "It'd be tough catchin' me boy, 'cause I'm The Intimidator."

He said: "Boy, do you make fans stand an' scream your name?
"Can you hit 'em in the rear an' grab another gear, still roll into victory lane?"
He said: "Boy, do you know how it feels to run three wide?
"'Cause if you're Daytona-bound, let me warn you, you're in for a ride."

He said: "Boy, can you make fans stand an' scream your name?
"Can you hit 'em in the rear an' grab another gear, still roll into victory lane?"
He said: "Boy, do you know how it feels to run three wide?
"'Cause if you're Daytona-bound, let me warn you, you're in for a ride."

"If you're Daytona-bound, let me warn you, you're in for a ride."

"You been ridin' with the legend, an' it's a fast ride."

"Yo Chase, what's up man? What you doing?"
"C'mon man, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Heh, I'm going out"

We got the crew and the crew cap rocking that rebel flag
All hats back like a redneck rat pack
Boys looking cool blowing smoke from the mary jane
Girls hair down, frayed out, brought that A game
Kick back and watch how we do
Like Project X, we're next on the YouTube, yeah

We going out, we going out
We got our eyes blurred right and the weird up loud
We going out, yeah we ignite the night in the sunburn town
Locked and loaded, rocked and rolling
Driving our shit just like we stole it
All night, good time, damn right
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out

It's going down like a whiskey waterfall
So raise your cup up up for a rockstar roll call
The yeti's low quick damn right we're killing it
Cold throwing in looks like we'll be chilling it

We going out, we going out
We got our eyes blurred right and the weird up loud
We going out, yeah we ignite the night in the sunburn town
Locked and loaded, rocked and rolling
Driving our shit just like we stole it
All night, good time, damn right
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out

Now they say lightning don't strike twice
But we here tonight, ain't we?

We going out, we going out
We got our eyes blurred right and the weird up loud
We going out, yeah we ignite the night in the sunburn town
Locked and loaded, rocked and rolling
Driving our shit just like we stole it
All night, good time, damn right
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out, we going out
We going out, out, out, out, we going out
We going out, out, out, out, we going out

What do you say dude? You down?
Hell yeah, count me in for that man

Shootin' Dr. Pepper cans with your brand new Red Ryder
That old folding lawn chair makes the perfect x-wing fighter
Those no name baseball cards spinning in your spokes
Now that's cool

Turnin' 17 and daddy loosens up the curfew
Drivin' home at midnight that old Buick smells like perfume
Making your own money, having coffee with your folks
Now that's cool

Knowin 'where you're goin' embracin' where you've been
Being criticized for standin' strong in a battle you can't win
Livin' in a moment you may never see again
Let your heart break some rules now that's cool

Wakin up with your new bride a room beside the ocean
10 years later goin back to relive that emotion
She tells you what shes thinking but never says a word
Now that's cool

Knowin where you're goin' embracin' where you've been
Being criticized for standin' strong in a battle you can't win
Livin' in a moment you may never see again
Let your heart break some rules now that's cool

The pitcher is your six year old, you're his full time catcher
He gets a new BB gun and you'll put your eye out lecture
Your 3 year old is singin' the song that she just learned
Now thats cool

Knowing where you're goin' embracing where you've been
Being criticized for standing strong in a battle you can't win
Livin in a moment you may never see again
Let your heart break some rules now that's cool


She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I know I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you coming over, I already thought it over
And okay, so now what


And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car


So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin


And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car


We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, you know what's on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out


And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're going
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are


It's been a real good run
Playin' out here in the sun
Year after year, beer after beer
I've watched this crowd grow
I swear you all don't know
What you mean to me
It's been something to see
I remember when we started
This week long party
And to think that it's over
It makes me want to spring break down


Just think about all our good times together
Yea, how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down


Next year I'll go through pictures
Wishin' I was down there with ya
Hanging out, it'll kill me then
But I'm here right now
So let's raise up our cups
Can't throw 'em up high enough
Let me buy you one last round
Before I spring break down


Just think about all our good times together
Yea, how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down


We made this sun tan city
And all of ya'll sang along so loud
We took this beach town over
You all do not know if might sound crazy
But you gonna make my spring break down


Just think about all our good times together
And when we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
Ooo...but the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down
Swear I'm about to spring break down


Ya'll up there on them shoulders
Good and bad hangovers
I'm about to spring break down

Thanks for calling
It's so good to hear your voice
But you keep breaking up
In all the static and the noise
But I keep listening
Cause I never had a choice when it came to you

I'd love to see you
If you're ever out this way
You sound happy
Guess things are working out okay
And I'm getting better
At putting one foot in front of the other

And I know that California ain't to blame
And I know there's a tons of people in LA

But if you ever get lonely
And you miss me
If you need someone to listen
Even if it's only
The sound of someone's voice who loves you
That you need to hear
You know where to find me
If you ever get lonely

Sounds like a good time
Going down at the other end
You got a new love, got a new life
A whole new set of friends
But are you listenin'
Do you expect me to pretend that I don't love you
I don't love you

But if you ever get lonely
And you miss me
If you need someone to listen
Even if it's only
The sound of someone's voice who loves you
That you need to hear
You know where to find me
If you ever get lonely

Were you ever really listening?
Were you ever really there?

But if you ever get lonely
And you miss me
If you need someone to listen
Even if it's only
The sound of someone's voice who loves you
That you need to hear
You know where to find me
If you ever get lonely
If you ever get lonely

I was lousy at math, failed historian
Carlene was the valedictorian
I was the quarter back in the back of classes
She was the whiz kid in horned rim glasses

It's been a long time since I've been around
Since I stepped foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old school yard
When this red head pulled up in a blue sports car
She said, "I bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever."
It took a second to put it all together and I said

Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean
Girl you glitter like hollywood
Good god carlene
You sure are lookin good

She said hop in let's go for a spin
Tell me whatcha been doing boy and where you been
I said I write songs, you probably didn't know, but I
Finally got a couple out on country radio
She said, "What a switch, ain't life funny, I've got a PHD
Now I'm modeling for money."
Imagine little miss 4.0 just smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue
I said you've come a long way since graduation
Let me say without hesitation
You've surpassed everyone's expectations

Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean
Girl you glitter like hollywood
Good god carlene
You sure are lookin good

I said I hope to see you again someday
She said another ten years is too long to wait
Pick me up at my Momma's at eight!

And I said

Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean
Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean
Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean


I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks


One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul
In the boondocks

I can feel that
Muddy water running through my veins
I can hear that
Lullaby of the midnight train
And it sings to me and sounds familiar


I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks


I can taste that honeysuckle
And it's still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old Camp Creek
And it calls to me like a warm wind blowing


I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks


It's where I learned about living
Its where I learned about love
Its where I learned about working hard
And having a little was just enough
It's where I learned about Jesus
And knowing where I stand
You can take it or leave it
This is me
This is who I am
Give me a tin roof, a front porch, and a gravel road
And that is home to me, feels like home to me


I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks


You get a line I'll get a pole
We'll go fishing in the craw fish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday morning


I got red dirt stains
On my boots and jeans
Callused fingers
From my guitar strings
Wild like the wind
In the tall pine trees
I've got roots
And I got wings


I raise my glass
On a Saturday night
I thank the Lord above
On my Sunday drive
For daddy's hands
And momma's dreams
He gave me roots
She gave me wings


He said: "run on love
And run on life
And plant some seeds
Until you're tired
Don't take anything at all for granted"


She said: "raise your hands
And raise your babies
Be yourself
And never change it
Be everything you ever want to be"


He said: "run on love
And run on life
And plant some seeds
Until you're tired
Don't take anything at all for granted"


She said: "raise your hands
And raise your babies
Be yourself
And never change it
Be everything you ever want to be"


I saddle up
When I get down
Sing every night
In a different town
And I've got a man who wears my ring
And I got roots
And I got wings
Yeah I got roots
I got wings

Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple of tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday
Everyone *dancing* merrily in the new old-fashioned way

You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree *at the chistmas party hop*
*Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple of tries to stop*
Rocking around the christmas tree have a happy holiday
Everyones dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned

Rocking around the chrismas tree have a happy holiday
Everyones dancing merrily in the new old-fashion way

I like blue eyes, hers are green
Not like the woman of my dreams
And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned
Five foot three isn't tall
She's not the girl I'd pictured at all
In those paint by number
Fantasies I've had

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more

No, it wasn't at first sight
But the moment I looked twice
I saw the women I was born to love
Her laughter filled my soul
When I hold her I don't wanna let go
When it comes to her, I can't get enough

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more!

More than I dreamed of
More than any man deserves...and I couldn't
Ask for a more than a love like hers

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more


Chrome
She can see herself in the shiny grill and the wire wheels
Of a red Chevelle, with four on the floor and the top down
Chrome
Zippin' by on an Electra Glide with dual tailpipes doin' 105
In the broad daylight, on a two-lane headin' out to town


Forget pink and purple paisleys
Little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold, in her rainbow
Her favorite color is chrome


Chrome
She got her leg up high on the bumper of my big black Mack truck
With a smoke stack pointed towards the sky, and mud flaps, you know the kind
Chrome
I said hey little girl you sure look nice, do you wanna ride
I won't bite, she climbs inside, says hell no, I wanna drive


Forget pink and purple paisleys
Little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold, in her rainbow
Her favorite color is chrome


It's chrome alright shiny, nice polished
Chrome, chrome


Forget pink and purple paisleys
Little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold, in her rainbow
Her favorite color is chrome


Her favorite color is chrome
That girl is all about chrome
She sure loves chrome


Don't worry about the damage done
Just let those words roll off your tongue
Even if you're lying
If you really don't mean it, I don't care
If you need a little buzz to get you there
Then baby I'm buying


Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do?


Yeah baby, I'm begging you to lead me on
Say it feels good to be back in my arms
And then don't call me
I don't mind a little smoke getting in my eyes
Baby, take your hands, take your lies
And lay 'em on me


Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do?


Well don't worry about the damage done
Just let those words roll of your tongue
Even if you're lying


Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do?
Say you do
Just say you do

Dancing in the living room, cutting up a rug
Dancing with the baby looks more like a hug
Living in a house made of sawmill wood
Rollover Beethoven never sounded so good

Chorus:
So come on baby, baby let's go
Where we get the money honey I don't know
But one more baby's alright by me
We'll just add another limb to the family tree

Well raising up babies is our new sport
You're one day late and I'm a dollar short
Now maybe it was planned and maybe it was a goof
But a cat's just gotta dance on a hot tin roof

Chorus:
Yeah come on baby, baby let's go
Where we get the money honey I don't know
But one more baby's alright by me
We'll just add another limb to the family tree

Well the lawnmower's broke and the tax is due
And if I find another tick I'm gonna come unglued
We got hand-me down clothes and hand-me down shoes
We got the big belly momma-here-we-go-again blues

Chorus:
Hey hey baby, baby let's go
Where we get the money honey I don't know
But one more baby's alright by me
We'll just add another limb to the family tree

Baby, whooooahh
Where we get the money, hell I don't know
One more baby's alright by me
It's alright
It's alright now baby
We'll just add another limb to the family tree
Well just add another limb baby

We'll just add another limb to the family tree


I just spent three nights in a two night town
Sun's coming up and I’m just going down
Am I ever gonna turn my life around
I just spend three nights in a two night town


It was women, it was sinning, it was alcohol
It was everything the Bible says will make a man fall
And I didn’t wanna little lord I wanted it all
It was women, it was sinning, it was alcohol


When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't falling my way
Why do I, always gotta stay to long 'til it’s too late


I just spend three nights in a two night town
With a bunch of lost souls out tryna get found
Girl I’ve been a little crazy since you walked out
So I just spend three nights in a two night town


That's right


When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't falling my way
Why do I, always gotta stay to long 'til it’s too late


I just spend three nights in a two night town
Suns coming up and I’m just going down
But baby this pain is still hanging around
I think I’ll spend four nights in a two night town


I was sitting at the cafÈ for a bite
Couldn’t help but overhear this guy
He just pulled up in a U-Haul truck
Tell Becky how pumped he was
‘Bout movin’ here for his new job
And what a cool little spot it was
Kinda made me jealous, made me mad
Wish I could see this place like that


Yeah I wish I was new to this town
Just pullin’ in, checkin’ it out
For the first time
Wish I could go anywhere
And not be afraid
Of finding you there
Yeah girl when I see you around
I wish I was new to this town


I can’t put my feet on this sidewalk
Without hearin’ you laugh or hearin’ you talk
And every street’s a memory
Of just how good it used to be
I can’t walk into that corner bar
Without someone askin’ how you are
And how you’re doing and how you been
I gotta go through it all again




I wonder what it feels like
To hop in my truck
And not think about us
Just go for a ride
Stop at that stoplight
Not think about you
Sittin’ here by my side




I wish I was new to this town, oh yeah
I wish I was new to this town, oh yeah
I wish I was new to this town
Yeah
Wish I was new to this town


It is a little too late
I am a little too gone
A little too tired of this hanging on
So I am letting go while I am still strong enough to
It is got a little too sad
I am a little too blue
It is a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I am big time over your baby
It is a little too late


No I do not want to want to talk about what we can do about us anymore
Only time you and me wasting is the time it takes to walk right out that door
Yeah talk about water under the bridge
You should know by now girl that is all this is




There was a time
This heart of mine
Would take you back every time
Do not you know?
It is been two packs of cigarettes
A sleepless night
A nervous wreck, a day ago
Now you have got no business coming around
I am closing up shop
Shutting us down



Well, I'm overworked and I'm underpaid
And it's overcast, gloomy and gray
The days are getting shorter, the nights are getting colder
Summertime is gone but that don't mean it's over

I got a dime store cooler made of Styrofoam
And it's loaded with limes and cold Coronas
I pointed my truck towards Pensacola
But before I go I had to phone ya and say

Hey sugar, shotgun's where I want ya
With not much more than your sunscreen on ya
There's a sweet little piece of beach
With our name on it, so doggone it

Why wait for summer?
Why wait for summer to show up?
Why wait when somewhere down there
Summer is waiting on us?
Summer is waiting on us, oh, it is

Let's bust a move south, towards that equator
And get the heck out of this refrigerator
Let's follow that heat to a summer wonderland
We're gonna make snow angels in the soft, white sand

I got a dime store cooler made of Styrofoam
And it's loaded with limes and cold Coronas
I pointed my truck towards Pensacola
But before I go I had to phone ya and say

Hey sugar, shotgun's where I want ya
With not much more than your sunscreen on ya
There's a sweet little piece of beach
With our name on it, so doggone it

Why wait for summer?
Why wait for summer to show up?
Why wait when somewhere down there
Summer is waiting on us? Oh
Summer is waiting on us, oh yeah

I got a dime store cooler, it's Styrofoam
It's loaded with limes and cold Coronas
I pointed my truck towards Pensacola
But before I go I had to phone ya and say

Hey sugar, shotgun's where I want ya
With not much more than your sunscreen on ya
There's a sweet little piece of beach
With our name on it, so doggone it

Why wait for summer?
Why wait for summer to show up?
Why wait when somewhere down there
Summer is waiting on us? Yeah
Summer is waiting on us, yeah

Why wait for summer to show?
Why wait for summer?
Why wait for summer to show up?

It was noon time, down time, break time
Summertime, Miller Time, anytime
She was looking pretty fine
A red light, green light, go
All fired upside downtown
She was shaking me all around
I was tuned in, going nowhere, second wind
Jonesing, drooling, feeling good, if you would

(chorus)
Oh yeah, by the way she moves
She's got me rolling in dirt in a white T-shirt
Breaker, breaker 1-9, she's a big ol' flirt
By now she's got me pretty tied up
Tied down, any way I choose
I got nothin' to lose

In like Flynn, I was
Looking for the win
Just trying anything, hey
Baby, where you been
All my life I've been looking for
Someone like you
Falling head over heels
Hey, what can I do

(chorus)

(bridge)
Now I'm in the fast lane, going 98
By now I know she can
Smooth operate me
I know now, she's no goody-two-shoes
But hey, I got myself nothin' to lose

(chorus 2x)
Noon time, down time, break time
Summertime, Miller Time, any time
She was looking pretty fine
In like Flynn I was looking for the win
Just trying anything, hey baby where you been
All my life I been looking for someone like you
Falling head over heels hey what can I do
I got nothin' to lose, yeah

An' when you cry, be sure to dry your eyes
'Cause better days are sure to come
An' when you smile, be sure to smile wide
An' don't let them know that they have won
An' when you walk, walk with pride: don't show the hurt inside
Because the pain sill soon be gone

An' when you dream, dream big
As big as the ocean, blue
'Cause when you dream it might come true
But when you dream, dream big

An' when you laugh, be sure to laugh out loud
'Cause it will carry all your cares away
An' when you see, see the beauty all around and in yourself
An' it will help you feel okay
An' when you pray, pray for strength to help to carry on
But when the troubles come your way

An' when you dream, dream big
As big as the ocean, blue
'Cause when you dream it might come true
But when you dream, dream big

An' when you laugh, be sure, (Dream big.)
To laugh out loud

'Cause it will carry all your cares away
And when you see, see the beauty, (Dream big.)
All around and in yourself

But when the troubles come your way

An' when you dream, dream big

'Cause when you dream it might come true
An' when you dream, dream big

Spent the night with Jim Beam and Johnny Walker Red
Woke up with a freight train runnin through my head
I'm a beer man

Bobby's more the wine kind
Donny does his shots
Sammy sips Martini's
Willie smokes pot
But I'm a beer man

I've done a little steppin out there on a limb
But my open mind winds up closed again
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans
Simple maybe, but that's who I am
Hey, I'm just a beer man

Take your Caviar and that fish--it ain't cooked
Take it off the cracker and throw it on a hook
I'm a beer man
Lord and if I was a rich man, tell ya what I'd do
I'd be the same ol' plain ol' guy you always knew
Just a beer man

I've done a little steppin out there on a limb
But my open mind winds up closed again
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans
Simple but that's who I am
Hey, I'm just a beer man

Yeah I've done a lil steppin out there on a limb
My open mind winds up closed again
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans
Call me simple but I can't change who I am
Oh I'm just a beer man

Yeah I'm a beer man

Yeah I'm a beer maaaaaaaaan, yes I am!

Man in the mirror said, 'Boy, I tried to warn 'ya'
Yea, yea, yeah, yeah

Pre Chorus

I know there's no one here but me
So why do I still feel her

Chorus

Isn't she long gone by now
I heard she was livin' in a West Coast town
Sellin' marguaritas from a tiki hut on the beach (yeah)
Didn't I see with my own eyes
That bus pulled away as she waved goodbye
I know I did
But somethin' keeps tellin' me
She's back again
Isn't she

Old boy Goose bought a new pontoon
Roll out now, hit the lake by noon
You bring the drinks and I'll crank the tunes
Get some hot sun
Jeep full of girls couldn't get no hotter
Flag 'em down holler won't you foller
There's a party floating on the water
It's going down right now
Come on jump on

The booze cruise, summer groove
I wanna see your booty move
Looks like you need another
So let me mix you up a Redneck Margarita
You know the one just straight tequila
All aboard we're cutting loose
So come on jump on
The booze cruise

Don't need bait, no line because
We're just catchin' us a buzz
Pass around some of that good stuff
Till dawn, it's on
Joe got drunk and fell in the lake
Ray passed out but make no mistake
Any minute now he'll wake in bake
Burn it up, turn it up
Come on jump on

The booze cruise, summer groove
I wanna see your booty move
Ooh so many hotties
Who wants to do a body shot off a string bikini
We call that a hillbilly martini
All aboard we're cutting loose
So come on jump on
The booze cruise

Look at headlight Lisa with a J?gerbomb
Done lost her mind, done lost her top
Walkin' round looking for one flip flop
Goodness she's a hot mess
Donnie's daughter she's sweet sixteen
He's madder than hell cause she was last seen
Jumping on the back of some boy's jet ski
That girl done flew the coupe (goodbye)
No telling what you'll lose

On the booze cruise
What kind of liquor makes your tushy move
Y'all let me mix you up a Redneck Margarita
You know the one just straight tequila
Good Lord all aboard
Come on jump on

The booze cruise, summer groove
I wanna see your booty move
Ooh so many hotties
Who wants to do a body shot off a string bikini
We call that a hillbilly martini
All aboard we're cutting loose
So come on jump on
The booze cruise

Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing
Joy to the world, the Savior reigns
Let all their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders, of His love
Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing

Yeah ahh yeah

Verse 1
You wake up from your dream and, and you don’t want to face the day
You can’t find a reason to think your world will ever change
You can hide beneath the covers
Or you can run outside head up high and carry on

Chorus
Life is a roller coaster ride
Time Turns a Wheel and Love Collides
Faith is believing you can close your eyes and touch the sky
So Shine while you have the chance to shine
Laugh even when you want to cry
Hold on tight to what you feel inside and ride…

Verse 2
It brings you up slowly then shoot you like a rocket towards the ground
It twists and it shakes you before it turns you upside down
You can’t see what’s around the corner
And You can’t look back, so just live it up and feel the rush

Chorus
Life is a roller coaster ride
Time Turns a Wheel and Love Collides
Faith is believing you can close your eyes and touch the sky
So Shine while you have the chance to shine
Laugh even when you want to cry
Hold on tight to what you feel inside and ride…

Ride, ride, ahh yeah, yeah

Oh yeah

Shine while you have the chance to shine
Laugh even when you want to cry
Hold on tight to what you feel inside and ride

Ride, ride, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!!!!

Hotels are made for two night stays
Checking in and out
Meeting strangers in the lobby
Waking up and leaving town
The next day
But love ain't

And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide
From all the pain
But love ain't

Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

Sad movies are for crying on the couch
There in the dark
That sad song it was written
Just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain't

Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

(Love ain't) I wonder what he's doing
(Love ain't) feeling like a fool
And you can't
Keep letting him do it to you

'Cause love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't
Love ain't (Love ain't)
(Love ain't) Love ain't


What'd he do this time?
Did he break your heart?
I can tell you been crying... and baby here you are
And I always know any time you show up at my door past 11 o'clock that he really must've pissed you off


Take it out on me
And put your lips on mine
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call
You always got a shoulder anytime it all goes bad, when you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell, you can always take it out on me
You can take it out on me baby
If you ever wanna leave, maybe
In the middle of the night, that's alright...
You can take, take...


Take off your coat, and baby come on in
Girl, let me help to get back at him
And I don't know why you never say goodbye
Whatever hell he's putting' you through
I can't wait for you to...


Take it out on me
And put your lips on mine
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call
You always got a shoulder anytime it all goes bad, when you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell, you can always take it out on me


Yeah, I'll lay you down and love you just the way you should be
Baby, so now that you're ready...
Take it out on me
You can take it out on me baby
If you ever wanna leave, maybe
In the middle of the night, that's alright...
You can take, take...


Take it out on me
And put your lips on mine
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call
You always got a shoulder anytime it all goes bad, when you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell, you can always take it out on me
You can take it out on me baby
If you ever wanna leave, maybe
In the middle of the night, that's alright...
You can take, take, take it out on me



I was sitting there, with my fork in hand
Staring at my lousy ravioli can
As she walked right in and said to me
Is there any way that I can make your day complete
I told her if there's anyway you can
Could you grease up that old metal roasting pan

And bake me a country ham
Honey glazed with a side of yams
Leave in it till it's golden brown
Pineapples all the way around
Let the sweet smell fill the air
Serve it to me in my underwear
I'm tired of eating imitation Spam
Could you bake me a country ham

I looked at her, with hungry eyes
She asked if I needed ketchup for my curly fries
I held my breath I could hardly wait
For my little slice of heaven on that Dixie plate
I could feel the juices running down my chin
As my stomach started singing once again

Could you bake me a country ham
Honey glazed with a side of yams
Leave it in till it's golden brown
Pineapples all the way around
Let the sweet smell fill the air
Serve it to me in my easy chair
I'm tired of eating imitation Spam
Could you bake me a country ham

Could bake me a country ham
Honey glazed with a side of yams
Leave it in till it's golden brown
Pineapples all the way around
Serve it to me in my underwear
I m tired of eating imitation Spam
Could you bake me a country ham


Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away


I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry


Would it help if I turned a sad song on
"All By Myself" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's going to hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hiding this way


I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry


Yeah-eh-eah
Yeah, yeah-eh-eah


I like to hold your hand up high on the Ferris wheel
And how front porch swingin' with you makes me feel, yeah
But when you pull up in your big ol' truck
I can't climb up in it fast enough


'Cause I'm your shotgun girl along for the ride
Your dashboard drummer on a Saturday night
Crankin' up Waylon, Willie and Merle
So throw one arm around me now, honey
We'll sling that gravel just like Bonnie and Clyde
I'd ride with you all around the world
'Cause boy, I'm your shotgun girl
Yeah, I'm a shotgun girl


There's not a piece of road 'round here we ain't burned down
Except that stretch that heads on outta town, yeah
Whenever you need to feel that freedom
Leave a little room for me


'Cause I'm your shotgun girl along for the ride
Your dashboard drummer on a Saturday night
Crankin' up Waylon, Willie and Merle
So throw one arm around me now, honey
We'll sling that gravel just like Bonnie and Clyde
I'd ride with you all around the world
'Cause boy, I'm your shotgun girl
Yeah, I'm a shotgun girl
Whoo!
Mmm, yeah


'Cause I'm your shotgun girl along for the ride
Your dashboard drummer on a Saturday night
Crankin' up Waylon, Willie and Merle
So throw one arm around me now, honey
We'll sling that gravel just like Bonnie and Clyde
I'd ride with you all around the world
'Cause boy, I'm your shotgun girl
I'm a shotgun girl


Yeah-eh-eah
Yeah, yeah-eh-eah
I'm calling shotgun baby
Yeah-eh-eah
Yeah, yeah-eh-eah


It's Independence Day
I'm free
And it's a strange place to be
I'm gonna break these chains
Unleash the changes in me
I see an endless road
I feel the restless wind
I've lost the fear inside
Cause I've got no choice
But to live or die


Suddenly you're in this fight
Alone
Steppin' out into the great
Unknown
And the night's the hardest
Time
When the doubts run through
Your mind
'Cause suddenly you find yourself
Alone
Suddenly you find yourself


In an empty room
With a suitcase on the floor
It'll be daylight soon
I'm gonna wage my private war
Who's watching over me
Must be a guardian angel
I just need time to breathe
And give my life
The best of me


Suddenly you're in this fight
Alone
Steppin' out into the great
Unknown
And the night's the hardest
Time
When the doubts run through
Your mind
'Cause suddenly you find yourself
Alone
Suddenly you find yourself


Suddenly you're in this fight
Steppin' out and then


Suddenly you're in this fight
Alone
Steppin' out into the great
Unknown
And the night's the hardest
Time
When the doubts run through
Your mind
'Cause suddenly you find yourself
Alone
Suddenly you find yourself

You've been livin' way too long
In broken-promise land
Your dreams crushed an' scattered
Like a million grains of sand
I'd love to be your redemption
But I am just a man
I may never be a hero
But I'am a rock you can lean on

If I don't love you like you deserve;
If I don't stop every tear you're cryin';
If I don't make your life
A Heaven on this earth
I'll die tryin'
I'll die tryin'

I'll listen to your secret prayer
An' share your deepest wish;
Search for a hundred years
Just to find the perfect kiss
Of everything within my power
There's nothin' I won't give
To be that part of you an' your life
Oh, that takes what's wrong an' makes it right

If I don't love you like you deserve;
If I don't stop every tear you're cryin';
If I don't make your life
A Heaven on this earth
I'll die tryin'
I'll die tryin'

I may never be a hero
But I'm a rock you can lean on

If I don't love you like you deserve;
If I don't stop every tear you're cryin';
If I don't make your life
A Heaven on this earth
I'll die tryin'
Oh, I'll die tryin'
I'll die tryin'


Ain't no rain as cold as the look she just gave him
Everyone around us knows a storm has just rolled in
I'll call for the check now baby, you go get the car
They'll stay here and fight it out, yeah they'll close down this bar


We'll go home and lay down safe in the arms of love
And we’ll dance all night long on the edge of can’t get enough
And we'll wake up in the morning like we always do
Drunk on the beautiful truth
We got love a 100 proof


She's gonna tell me that he can't help but get messed up
And he's gonna hang on you and say this night's just getting fun
They'll order another round now and try to make us stay
But you gotta know when to say when it's time to walk away


We'll go home and lay down safe in the arms of love
And we’ll dance all night long on the edge of can’t get enough
And we'll wake up in the morning like we always do
Drunk on the beautiful truth


Yes baby, I'm addicted to your touch
I'm still hung over from the last time we made love like this
This ain't in no shot glass, no bottle baby, no


We'll go home and lay down safe in the arms of love
We’ll dance all night long on the edge of can’t get enough
And we'll wake up in the morning like we always do
Drunk on the beautiful truth
So drunk on the beautiful truth
Cause we got love a 100 proof


Stressed out, running late, racing down the interstate
Spilled hot coffee, down the front of my jeans
It's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent
Not a minute left for me to be me
Been going like nothing can wait
I got to get my priorities straight


I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot


Friday night, here we go, do a little do-si-do
Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath
Tell the band slow it down, there she is, think I found
Maybe Ms. Wonderful, I haven't met yet
It just hit me like a wrecking ball
She's giving me a wake up call


I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot


Step back, smell the rose
Feel the sand between your toes
Unplug, unwind
Step out in the sunshine


I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little
I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Take the girl, get a map and pick any old dot
Live a little, we need to live a little, love a lot


You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts


I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now


Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:


Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."


You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it?
(Hold on)
We're gonna make it now
(Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (see it now)


Sunday morning, I heard the preacher say
Thou shall not kill
I don't wanna hear nothing else about killing
And that it's God's will
Because our children are watching us
They put their trust in us
They're gonna be like us
So let's learn from our history
And do it differently


I hope, for more love, more joy and laughter
I hope, we'll have more than we'll ever need
I hope, we'll have more happy ever after
I hope, we can all live more fearlessly
And we can lose all the pain and misery
I hope, I hope


Oh, Rosie, her man he gets too rough
That's all she can say, is he's a good man
He don't mean no harm
He was just brought up that way
But our children are watching us
They put their trust in us
They're gonna be like us
It's okay for us to disagree
We can work it out lovingly


I hope, for more love, more joy and laughter
I hope, we'll have more than we'll ever need
I hope, we'll have more happy ever after
I hope, we can all live more fearlessly
And we can lose all the pain and misery
I hope, I hope


There must be a way to change what's going on
No I don't have all the answers


I hope, for more love, more joy and laughter
I hope, we'll have more than we'll ever need
I hope, we'll have more happy ever after
I hope, we can all live more fearlessly
And we can lose all the pain and misery
I hope, I hope

I blame the vain
For what we wear
And I'll blame the blind
When we can't see
I'll blame it all
On someone else
'Til there's nobody left
Then I'll just blame me

I'll blame her mind
For the thoughts we share
Whoa, and I'll blame her heart
For the time we cared
I'll blame it all
On how we used to be
'Til she's finally gone
Then I'll just blame me

(So go ahead and) Blame...
Anything that you want
'Cause it all ends up the same
When everything that you've
Been claiming is wrong

(Oh and don't you know that) Blame...
Is always never enough
It just keeps you in the game
Until you've only got
Yourself left to bluff

So I'll blame the vain
For what we wear
Yeah, and I'll blame the blind
When we can't see
I'll blame it all
On someone else
'Til there's nobody left
Then I'll just blame me
Till she's finally gone
Then I just blame me


It's five o'clock, just got paid
I'll be off the next two days
No more working like dogs
No more leash, no more boss
I got a weekend of nothing to do at all


Yee haw!


I know a place down the road
The girls are hot, the beer is cold
It's two-for-one, yeah, that's right
Not just drinks, it's girls to guys
I hear the twins are back in town from Saginaw




You take your all-right
You take your can't-wait
A lot of of bring-it-on and some damn straight
And mix it all up with some down home southern drawl, y'all
You got your yee haw!


The place is packed, the line is long
The band knows every Haggard song
I'm getting loose, I've had a few
She wants to dance, I do too
But her boyfriend's mad
I, I think he wants to brawl
All right






I'm talking big time
I mean saddle up and hold on tight
And if you know what I'm talking' about, y'all, yeah
How about a yee haw! Ha, ha
Yep, bow bow, Y E E H A W, yee haw!


I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, "Okay, let's talk"
And I said


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life


Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
(ha-ha-ha, it's so fun)


I’m lost in her there holding that pink rod and reel
She’s doing almost everything but sitting still
Talking about her ballet shoes and training wheels
And her kittens
And she thinks we’re just fishing
I say, “Daddy loves you, baby” one more time
She says, “I know. I think I got a bite.”
And all this laughing, crying, smiling dying here inside’s
What I call, living


And she thinks we’re just fishing on the riverside
Throwing back what we could fry
Drowning worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She hasn’t even thinking about
What’s really going on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishin’


She’s already pretty, like her mama is
Going to drive the boys all crazy
Give her daddy fits
And I better do this every chance I get
Because time is ticking
(Yeah it is)


And she thinks we’re just fishing on the riverside
Throwing back what we could fry
Drowning worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She hasn’t even thinking about
What’s really going on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishing


She hasn’t even thinking about
What’s really going on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishing
Yeah, aww, she thinks we’re just fishing
We aren’t only fishing
(This isn’t about fishing)

I'd be jealous too, if she was with you
I'd be out of my mind, watching her move
If I was just a guy with across the room view
I'd be jealous too, if she was with you, with you


She laughs like she just broke into a hotel pool
She loves deserts and the sunsets out in Malibu
If you felt the way it feels the way she looks at you
I'd be jealous too, I'd be jealous too


She's a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever wild smile appeal is like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they ain't ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Can't blame 'em if they want her like I do

I'd be jealous too, if she was with you
I'd be out my mind, watching her move
If I was just the guy with across the room view
I'd be jealous too, if she was with you


She comes on stronger than a bourbon street hand grenade
It's like you know her 'fore you even really know her name
If you could see her in the morning sleeping next to you
Just like I get to, I'd be jealous too


She's a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever wild smile appeal is like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they ain't ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Can't blame 'em if they want her like I do

I'd be jealous, I'd be jealous
I'd be jealous too
I'd be jealous, I'd be jealous
I'd be jealous too


She's a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever wild smile appeal is like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they ain't ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Can't blame 'em if they want her like I do

I'd be jealous too, if she was with you
I'd be out my mind, watching her move
If I was just the guy with across the room view
I'd be jealous too, if she was with you, with you


It am not natural for a delta man
To be surrounded by all this sand
To fear the echoes of live rounds
And to never sleep when the sun goes down
So I'm writing you this letter
To say I miss you more than ever and to promise you this


When I make it back to Memphis
I'm going to take you in my arms
And never let you go
And girl I promise you a kiss
For every day we've missed
Till I make it back to Memphis


I'll have to say I think we've done some good
If I had to do it all again I know I would
There's still a few shots every now and then
But they say this thing is finally coming to an end
So this might be my final letter
I say the sooner the better because I'm ready to come home




She reads his letters everyday, then she puts them all away
Next to his medal and a flag, that she would gladly give back


If it would bring him back to Memphis
So he could take her in his arms
And never let her go
Because she's still waiting for a kiss
For every day they've missed
Till he made it back to Memphis


Back to Memphis


Sunny days seem to hurt the most
I wear the pain like a heavy coat
I feel you everywhere I go
I see your smile, I see your face
I hear you laughing in the rain
I still can't believe you're gone


It ain't fair: you died too young
Like the story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no-one could take your place
An' sometimes I wonder
Who'd you be today?


Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams?
Settle down with a family
I wonder what would you name your babies?
Some days the sky's so blue
I feel like I can talk to you
An' I know it might sound crazy


It ain't fair: you died too young
Like the story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no-one could take your place
An' sometimes I wonder
Who'd you be today?


Today, today, today
Today, today, today




Sunny days seem to hurt the most
I wear the pain like a heavy coat
The only thing that gives me hope
Is I know I'll see you again someday

Someday, someday, someday

When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna do every little everything, anything girl
That you want me to, when it's finally just you and me
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night
I'm gonna make you go crazy baby
When I get my hands on you
Ain't nothin' in the world gonna slow me down

I've been waitin' on this for such a long, long time
I've been waitin' on a chance girl to make you mine
Your body's burnin' me, turnin' me inside out
I want you so bad, all that I can think about

When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna do every little everything, anything girl
That you want me to, when it's finally just you and me
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night
I'm gonna make you go crazy baby
When I get my hands on you
When I get my hands on you, yeah

We've been dancin' around this for way to long
Now I don't care if it's right or wrong
Just say the word and we're gonna be on our way
You're like a work of art, baby and I can't wait

When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna do every little everything, anything girl
That you want me to, when it's finally just you and me
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night
I'm gonna make you go crazy baby
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna hold you close, never let go
Just the way that you want me to
Yeah, cause it's all about you and me

We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night
Gonna make you go crazy, baby
When I get my hands on you
When I get my hands on you, yeah
If I get my hands on you, girl
When I get my hands on you


All the stars keep on falling around us
We were almost broken
Holding on as we felt our worlds collide, collide
Sometimes all the answers, baby, are right outside your door
Sometimes all we need is a little time, time


There’s no going back to the start again
Time will tell us how the story ends
So beautiful, we can make it right
The world is ours tonight
The only thing I have is everything to lose
I would lay it on the line for you
To be here by my side
The world is ours tonight


Turn the pages, we’ll write another chapter
Be the last one standing
Burn those bridges down and we’ll never go back, no
We don’t need all the answers baby
We’ve just gotta try
I refuse to walk away this time, this time


There’s no going back to the start again
Time will tell us how the story ends
So beautiful, we can make it right
The world is ours tonight
The only thing I have is everything to lose
I would lay it on the line for you
To be here by my side
The world is ours tonight

We can't take it back to the start again
Time will tell us how the story ends
So beautiful, we can make it right
The world is ours tonight
The only thing I have is everything to lose
I would lay it on the line for you
To be here by my side
The world is ours tonight
To be there by your side
The world is ours tonight
The world is ours tonight
The world is ours tonight


I'd spend a lot more time in the pouring rain
Without an umbrella
Covering my head
And I'd stood up to that bully when he pushed
And called me names
But I was too afraid
And I'd a gone on and saw Elvis that night he came to town
But mama said I couldn't
And I'd a-went skinny dipping with Jenny Carson
That time she dared me to
But I didn't


Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different


I wished I'd a spent more time with my dad
When he was alive
Now I don't have the chance
I wish I had told my brother how much I loved him
Before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
And I wish I had gone to church on Sunday morning
When my grandma begged me too
But I was afraid of God
And I wish I would've listened when they said Boy
You're going to wish you hadn't
But I wouldn't


Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different

People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
Oh, but I would


There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad
She could taste it
And I should have bought it'
But I didn't
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it
Blues and greens
But I wouldn't let her, wouldn't a-hurt nothing
She loved to be held and kissed and touched but I didn't do it
Not nearly enough
And if I'd a known that dance was going to be our last dance
I'd a asked that band to play on and on and on


Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different


People say they wouldn't change a thing, even if they could
Oh but I would
Oh whoa, Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things
I think we'd all done a lot of things different


Boots and buckles, red clay and sand
My point ain't subtle here, I'm a southern man
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter
Where the world don't seem so damn modern
Where a good old boy like me still has a chance


This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
Yeah, this is where I was born and this is where I will die


It's all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don't you wanna get down and dirty? Cause, Florida I'm thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, crazy old timer, sweet magnolia
Dive bars and diners, oh yeah
And even if you're up north
Come on down, come on down
Oh, it's all about the south


From daddy's Don Williams to mama's Patsy Cline
We're walking after midnight singing Tulsa time
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter
Where the world don't seem so damn modern
This is where I was born this is where I'll die, that's right!


It's all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don't you wanna get down and dirty? Cause, Florida I'm thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, crazy old timer, sweet magnolia
Dive bars and diners, oh yeah
And even if you're up north
Come on down, come on down
Oh, it's all about the south


This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I will die


It's all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don't you wanna get down and dirty? Cause, Florida I'm thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, crazy old timer, sweet magnolia
Dive bars and diners, oh yeah
And even if you're up north
Come on down, come on down
Oh, I Said, even if you're up north
Come on down, come on down
Oh, it's all about the south


This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die

Last night I put the top down
And drove to the edge of town
A part of me just kept on goin' when I turned around
Why did I turn around?

Every day it's more confusing wonderin' where I stand
The things you say and the things you're doing
Never go hand in hand
I don't understand

I don't know why you wanna keep me guessin'
I try to keep holding on
Just tell me what I want to hear or please just tell me no
Baby, make me stay or make me go

It's gonna take more than a cold shoulder
To make me walk away
Let's get it on or get it over, what have you got to say?
What have you got to say?

I don't know why you wanna keep me guessin'
I try to keep holding on
Just tell me what I want to hear or please just tell me no
Baby, make me stay or make me go

I don't know why you wanna keep me guessin'
I try to keep holding on
Just tell me what I want to hear or please just tell me no
Baby, make me stay or make me go
Yeah, baby, make me stay or make me go


Girl I've been waiting on this long hard day to get over
So i can rest my head right here on your shoulder
I just want to lay here and feel you breathe
Listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And see where it leads


We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
I want to make you close your eyes...oh yeah


You can make me work for it girl if you want to
Just leave a trail for me to follow you into the bedroom
And if you need a little bit of help from me
Babe there's not a button that I can't reach
Lets see where it leads




I want to take you somewhere...out there
Til the world fades out of sight




Hey girl, you know what you been missing?
Me, me, yeah
Hey girl, whoever you been kissing
It ain't me, me
I got that love medicinal
I'll make you feel invincible
I'm more than recreational
I'm what you need


I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that so right
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
With that good ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, gotta have it, you can't quit
I got your fix


I'll be the high that never lets you down (I got your fix)
The one you crave when no one is around (I got your fix)
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go, hey hey


Hey hey
Hey girl, he don't get you there never
So leave, oh just leave
Listen, baby baby baby baby girl
Let me make it feel better
Please, please, please, please

Get you falling in love at the end of the night
With that good ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, gotta have it, you can't quit

The one you crave when no one is around (when no one is around)
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go

With that good ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips

The one you crave when no one is around (when no one is around)
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go


Oh, no, no, no



Hope life's been good to you
Since you've been gone
I'm doing fine now—I've finally moved on
It's not so bad—I'm not that sad
I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive
I can't complain—I'm free again


And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath—to forget


Don't think I'm lyin' 'round cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really alright
I've never looked back—as a matter of fact


And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath—to forget


It only hurts when I breathe
Mmm, no, I've never looked back
As a matter of fact


And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath—to forget


Hurts when I'm breathing
Breaks when it's beating
Die when I'm dreaming
It only hurts when I breathe

I've changed the presets in my truck
So those old songs don't sneak up
They still find me and remind me
Yeah you come back that easy
Try restaurants I've never been to
Order new things off the menu
That I never tried 'cause you didn't like
But two drinks in, and you're by my side

I've talked to friends
I've talked to myself
I've talked to God
I prayed liked hell but I still miss you
I tried sober I tried drinking
I've been strong and I've been weak
And I still miss you

I'd give anything for one more minute with you
I still miss you
I still miss you baby

I never knew til you were gone
How many pages you were on
It never ends I keep turning
And line after line and you are there again
I dont know how to let you go
You are so deep down in my soul
I feel helpless so hopeless
Its a door that never closes
No I don't know how to do this

I've talked to friends
I've talked to myself
I've talked to God
I prayed liked hell but I still miss you

The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling, looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town


And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good


When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, Spark, and Light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time


Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game


And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good


When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loco's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time


Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all


When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time


Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now
Time, time, time

It was just another night in the hayfield
'Til she climbed down off of them four wheels
Yeah, yeah

Soon as that sundress hit the headlights
Every tailgate way out there was like yeah, yeah

She started walking over to me
Like she already knew me
Sat down right beside me
And asked if I was here alone

And I said
Yeah, yeah
Like I was nodding right along to a song on the radio
Yeah, yeah
Girl, how could I say no?
Whatever you're drinking, that's what I'm drinking
Girl, you're calling the shots tonight
Whatever you're thinking, that's what I'm thinking
Tell me what you got in mind

So I can say yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

She brought me a cup and I tried it
A little fruity but she asked if I liked it
So I said yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Then she played me some band on her iPod
Kinda hit me kinda hippie and I thought, "Naw."
But I said yeah, yeah, yeah

She said you wanna take a walk
To the river maybe cool off
She said, "I know a good spot."
And then she took my hand

And I said
Yeah, yeah
Like I was nodding right along to a song on the radio
Yeah, yeah
Girl, how could I say no?
Whatever you're drinking, that's what I'm drinking
Girl, you're calling the shots tonight
Whatever you're thinking, that's what I'm thinking
Tell me what you got in mind

So I can say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

A little later under that full moon
I didn't want the night to end too soon
I said, "It's getting late, do you need to go?"
And she said no

I was like
Yeah, yeah
Like I was nodding right along to a song on the radio
Yeah, yeah
Girl, if you say so
Whatever you're drinking, that's what I'm drinking
Girl, you're calling the shots tonight
Whatever you're thinking, that's what I'm thinking
Tell me what you got in mind

So I can say yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

(Keith Anderson/Chuck Cannon)

I remember summer 1993
She was tall and blonde and tan and man, she was all in love with me
She started talkin' 'bout our future and it scared me half to death
So I ran away but to this day her memory takes my breath
You should've seen her smile
You should've heard her laugh
And oh the way her eyes would dance
When she brushed her hair back

(Chorus)
She could've been mine
She would've been in another place and time
And now and then I go there in my mind
She would've been
She should've been
She could've been mine

Home for the holidays, a friend's party New Year's Eve
I turned around and found familiar blue eyes staring back at me
A little girl came runnin' up and took her by the hand
And a memory in miniature said, "Mommy, who's that man?"
You should've seen her little smile
You should've heard her little laugh
Oh the way her eyes just danced
When she brushed her hair back

Old man complaining about rock and roll
Young kid says that he's too old
Next thing you know the young kid grows
Into an old man complaining about rock n' roll

Oh, ain't it kinda sad
But oh, don't it make you laugh
How it stays the same
Change

Well a young girl wears her skirt too high
Old ladies point as she walks by
But I guess they forgot about junior high
When they were young girls wearing their skirts too high

Oh, ain't it kinda sad
But oh, don't it make you laugh
How it stays the same
Change, change

Old soul slips off to the other side
Meanwhile a newborn baby cries
Baby gets picked up by the hands of time
Carried safe through life to the other side

Oh, ain't it kinda sad
Oh, but don't it make you laugh
How it stays the same
Change, change
Change

(Cyndi Thomson/Chris Waters/Tommy Lee James)

It took me by surprise
When I saw you standin' there
Close enough to touch
Breathin' the same air
You asked me how I'd been
I guess that's when I smiled and said just fine
Oh, but baby I was lyin'

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

And as you walked away
The echo of my words
Cut just like a knife
Cut so deep it hurt
I held back the tears
Held on to my pride and watched you go
I wonder if you'll ever know

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

What I really meant to say
Is I'm really not that strong
No matter how I try
I'm still holdin' on
And here's the honest truth
I'm still in love with you
And, that's what I really meant to say

That's what I really meant to say
That's what I really meant to say

We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes
Three days before we had to be back

When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane

When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
You worked nights on end
'Till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
About the fun we've had
Just me and you
Doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

Standing in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Looking at him I say I can't believe son that you're grown

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
Of being like you
Now its me and her
Watching you and mom I've learned
I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life

I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life


You say you made some plans
Already with your friends
You're gonna hit the town
They'll be here any minute now
Oh and baby I don't know
Who keeps blowin' up your phone
But you've hit decline
At least a hundred times
You say that it's your boyfriend, but y'all ain't been doin' too good
Well that's good
And if you're wonderin' if you oughtta break up with him
Baby you should
Yeah you should


Drop everything, your plans, your man
I don't see a ring, on your pretty little hand
Drop some plastic on the tab, my Chevy into gear
Drop your keys by my door, your coat on my floor
We'll go from there, drop everything


Leave your car here at the bar
You can pick it up tomorrow
Girl I'll bring ya back
Baby you can crash
At my place and drop some ice
In a glass of whatever you like
Drop a needle, put some Marvin Gaye on
Let's get it on and


Drop everything, your plans, your man
I don't see a ring, on your pretty little hand
Drop some plastic on the tab, my Chevy into gear
Drop your keys by my door, your coat on my floor
We'll go from there, drop everything


Your friends say they'll forgive ya
Your man is gonna miss ya
But I just gotta kiss you right now
So right now


Drop everything, your plans, your man
I don't see a ring, on your pretty little hand
Drop some plastic on the tab, my Chevy into gear
Drop your keys by my door, your coat on my floor
We'll go from there, drop everything


Your plans, your man
I don't see a ring on your pretty little hand
Drop everything
Well drop Everything

I saw Star Wars at least 8 times
Had the pac-man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside
Stretch Armstrong

I was Roger Stauback back in my back yard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evil Kinevil scars
On my right arm
Well, I was a kid when Elvis died
And my mama cried

Chorus:
It was 1970- something
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Faucett hair-do days
Bell bottoms and 8-track tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
It was 1970-something

It was the dawning of a new decade
When we got our first microwave
And Dad broke down and finally shaved
Those sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubix cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke
In them cut off jeans
A Space Shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

Chorus:
It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
It was 1980-something

Now I got a mortgage and an SUV
But all this responsibility
Makes me wish sometimes
Sometimes....

Chorus:
It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
It was 1980-something

1970-something
Aw, it was 19-Something

You organize your life so perfectly
You even take the time to plan your spontaneity
You gotta place for everything except your heart
That world as you know is about to fall apart
Surprise

Here comes love to shake you up
Yank your chain and kick your butt
Right on outta that rut
There's no rhyme or reason, it's powerful strong
It rocks you outta your comfort zone
Into the great unknown
Surprise

The shock wears off, you settle in
When you realize you're happier than you have ever been
So you think we'll just leave well enough alone
But she's way ahead of you, she has been all along
Surprise

There comes love in a wedding dress
With a ring and a promise, you're scared to death
But you don't second guess
?Cause you trust your heart and you trust her more
You never thought you could be so sure
Of what forever's for
Surprise

One day you come home without a call
You see a suitcase packed and waiting in the hall
She comes in and looks at you through tears
And says I think it's time to go, the baby's almost here
Surprise

There comes love one minute old
Six precious pounds you're scared to hold
And she owns you heart and soul
There's clothes and cars and college one day
How will you keep those boys away
She smiles at you as if to say
Surprise

This story just goes on and on
But I've run out of time
Surprise


It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin’ for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy


Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game


That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable


We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down


Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn’t think that it was true


That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable


Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin’
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end


That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable


From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

I know your eyes have cried
Too many tears and I know
You've thought sometimes
You'd be better off alone

But I'm not those other guys
I know what I found when I found you
So climb in and let me show you
What a real love can do

'Cause sometimes
A love like this
Can make a man
Twice the man he is

Like Willie's guitar
Geronimo's rifle
I'll hold you steady
As Billy Graham's bible

I can promise you now
Our love will last
Baby, your heart is in
Good hands

I know you're hungry for
Something that'll take your breath away
And I'm here to help you find it
Put a smile back on your face

We'll roll down life's highway
With the freedom of a song
We'll fight for what we believe in
And keep our faith strong

'Cause sometimes
A love like this
Can make a man
Twice the man he is

Like Willie's guitar
Geronimo's rifle
I'll hold you steady
As Billy Graham's bible

I can promise you now
Our love will last
Baby, your heart is in
Good hands

Hey

When they write
Our life story
We'll go out
In a blaze of glory

Like Willie's guitar
Geronimo's rifle
I'll hold you steady
As Billy Graham's bible

I can promise you now
Our love will last
Baby, your heart is in
Good hands

Baby, your heart is in
Good hands

It's like the most amazing sunset
You've ever seen
There's never another quite the same
It just falls into some eternal sea
Like the end of a movie that makes you cry
You're sad when it's over
But you're glad you had
That moment that moved you deep inside

Beautiful goodbye, baby, goodbye
I enjoyed the ride
We really had us a time
It's a strange kinda high
A beautiful goodbye

I'm standing here watching you drive away
We were so grown up about it all
But how will it look in the light of day?
I miss you already, but don't turn around
It's funny how you know when it just won't work
And how letting go can make the sweetest sound

Beautiful goodbye, baby, goodbye
I enjoyed the ride
We really had us a time
It's a strange kinda high
A beautiful goodbye

So ironic, it's so confusing
To do the right thing and be losin
I'm always stuck with choosin
Ain't that just like life?

Hey yeah
Hey yeah yeah

Beautiful goodbye, baby, goodbye
I enjoyed the ride
We really had us a time
It's a strange kinda high
A beautiful goodbye
Goodbye, yeah

Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na na na goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na na na goodbye

Guys are playing pool, longnecks in a bucket
Bragging about their luck with the ladies in bed
Laughing when they ask him for all the dirty details
He don't say nothing just starts shaking his head

Spoken like a man, devoted to a woman
Not just any woman, but the love of his life
Spoken like a man, crazy about the feeling
He gets every evening when they turn out the light

Cue behind the eight, he's staring down the table
There's a cutie across the room trying to catch his eye
She walks across the bar with her number on a napkin
He gives it to a buddy with a wink and a smile

Spoken like a man, devoted to a woman
Not just any woman, but the love of his life
Spoken like a man, crazy about the feeling
He gets every evening when they turn out the light

He pays his tab, pulls his keys out of his pocket
The boys say, where you going, just one more game
Give us one good reason whey you can't hang
Turns at the door and just holds up his ring

Spoken like a man, devoted to a woman
Not just any woman, but the love of his life
Spoken like a man, crazy about the feeling
He gets every evening when they turn out the light

Spoken like a man, spoken like a man
Spoken like a man

I feel so bad
Got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou

Saving nickels
Saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

I'm going back some day
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine on Blue Bayou

Where the fishing boats with their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again on Blue Bayou

Saving nickels
Saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

I'm going back some day
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine on Blue Bayou

Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

That man of mine by my side
To see the moon and the evening tide
Oh, I'll never be blue
My dreams come true on Blue Bayou

Two in the morning, too hot to sleep
Tossin' and turning and twistin' the sheets
I feel an old weakness coming on strong

Window wide open in the back bedroom
Smell of sweet honeysuckle in full bloom
I feel an old weakness coming on strong

Feel like I'm running real low on willpower
Can't get you out of this heart of mine
From the break of dawn till the midnight hour
I keep fighting to let you go
But your love is beyond my control

Took down that picture of you and me
But every time I look up where it used to be
I feel an old weakness coming on strong

Still got your number next to the phone
Just when I believe, I can leave it alone
I feel an old weakness coming on strong

Feel like I'm running real low on willpower
Can't get you out of this heart of mine
From the break of dawn till the midnight hour
I keep fighting to let you go
But your love is beyond my control

It's an old weakness coming on strong
I feel an old weakness, an old weakness
I feel an old weakness coming on strong

She was touching up her makeup
I was standing next in line
I couldn't help but notice
'Neath those powder room lights
It was China red outlined in black
On the left side of her shoulder
In plain view
I just had to ask,"Hey, what's with that half heart tattoo?"

She glanced at me through the mirror
And started to laugh
She said,"I know this looks funny but there is another half
And it's China red outlined in black on the right side of his shoulder
Last I knew
Yeah somewhere out there is a match to this
Half a heart tattoo"

"Well that last I heard some redhead
Caught his eye in New Orleans
And before that it was a blonde in Baton Rouge
I know there's at least a dozen gals out sporting one of these
Thinking that they're the only fool
That he left with a half a heart tattoo"

Well girl you got my sympathy
I knew a guy like that
I said,"You ain't gonna believe this"
Then I pulled my jacket back
"Yeah it's China red outlined in black on the left side of my shoulder
Still fairly new
I guess there's just a whole mess of us
With a half a heart tattoo"

Well the last I heard he moved in
With some dancer from L.A
But I'm betting that won't last a week or two
He loves them long enough to leave his mark and then he's on his way
And he's so good they never have a clue
'Til they're stuck with a half a heart tattoo
So ladies make sure that guy standing next to you
Ain't wearing no half a heart tattoo

Ain't it funny how some things take you back
And the here and now just fades to black
When I pulled that blue tarp off that time machine
Man, it hits me
Seventeen years old runnin' on dumb luck
Spent the whole darn summer livin' in that truck
Them old tires still covered in all that mud
Like it sticks with me in my blood

When life was nothing more than living for the night
Just try'na steal a kiss on the tailgate of that ride
Good ole days don't wash away, just like that Georgia clay

Only one of my friends with a fake ID
It made me the hometown celebrity
Used to put her in park in a vacant lot
Yeah still can't believe we never got caught

When life was nothing more than living for the night

Just try'na steal a kiss on the tailgate of that ride
Good ole days don't wash away, just like that Georgia clay
All over everything
Every last memory
Man it's all comin' back to me

Ain't it funny how some things take you back

When life was nothing more than living for the night
Just try'na steal a kiss on the tailgate of that ride
Good ole days don't wash away, that's some things they just don't change
Just like that Georgia clay
All over everything
Every last memory
It's all comin' back to me


Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan


All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Take me to the Islands put my feet in the sand
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean
Singin Silent Night with the palm trees ablowin'


Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan


Well, if you're thinkin' bout getting me a present this year
Let me put a bug in your cute little ear
How bout two tickets to a tropical shore
Where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore
Instead of turkey we'll have mahi-mahi grill
And Pina Coladas in the blender chillin'


All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Take me to the Islands put my feet in the sand
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean
Singin' Silent Night with the palm trees ablowin'


Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
(its a real good plan)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan


Well everybody's praying for a Christmas so white
Come to think about it, that'd be alright
As long as it's sand and not snow on the ground
And everyday our skin gets a little more brown
We'll string some lights in a coconut tree
I'll rub some oil on you, and you can rub some on me


All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
I can see us baby on the beach hand in hand
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean..
Baby won't you say you and me we'll be going
Ooooo, I can almost feel my toes in the sand
(my toes in the sand)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan


Don't worry baby, we'll celebrate plenty
I'll buy you some shades and a brand new bikini
We won't have to worry about the holiday rush
It'll be you and me fallin' deeper in love


Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
(its a real good plan)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan(a real good tan)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

I put away the groceries
And I take my daily bread
I dream of your arms around me
As I tuck the kids in bed

I don't know what you're doin'
And I don't know where you are
But I look up at that great big sky
And I hope you're wishin' on that same
Bright star

I wonder, I pray

(Chorus:)
And I sleep alone
I cry alone
And it's so hard livin' here on my own
So please, come home soon
(Come home soon)

I know that we're together
Even though we're far apart
And I'll wear our lucky penny 'round my neck
Pressed to my heart

I wonder, I pray

(Repeat Chorus)

(Bridge:)
I still imagine your touch
It's beautiful missing something that much
But sometimes love needs a fighting chance
So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance

I wonder, I pray

(Second Chorus:)
I sleep alone
I cry alone
Without you this house is not a home
So please, come home soon

(Third Chorus:)
I walk alone
I try alone
I'll wait for you, don't want to die alone
So please, come home soon

Come home soon
Come home soon

Miss me baby
When you hear our favorite song
Miss me baby
And when you start to sing along
Think about all the times that we danced
In the light to it all night long, oh
Then miss me baby

And want me honey
Like you did the night you told me that you loved me
We couldn't wait anymore, left the keys in the door
Took my hand, pulled me down on the kitchen floor
Yeah, we were that crazy
Miss me baby

Because when he's holding you
Know that it's killing me
Let my memory be the reason girl
That you can't sleep
And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
And that I've touched your heart so deep
Girl you can't shake me
'Cause I love you, yes I need you
Miss me baby

Miss me baby
Until you can't take it no more
Miss me baby
Pack your bags and hit the door
I'm a man, I was wrong, forgive me
Come back home, I'll be waiting, right here waiting
Miss me baby

Because when he's holding you
Know that it's killing me
Let my memory be the reason girl
That you can't sleep
And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
And that I've touched your heart so deep
Girl you can't shake me
'Cause I love you, yes I love you
Miss me baby

And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
And that I've touched your heart so deep
Girl you can't shake me
'Cause I love you, yes I need you
Miss me baby

Every time you hear this song
Miss me baby


I'd be ridin' in a cab goin' downtown
Findin' faces I know in a big crowd
Tryin' to drink the pain away, mhmm
And I'd be stayin' out all night, never goin' home
Girl you know I'd lose all control
If I lost you


There would be a riot
Breakin' of my heart, I'd try to fight it
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin'
If I said I could live and breathe
Without you
There'd be a lot of lonely
Wishin' and prayin' that you would hold me
I would do most anything baby
If only you would come back to me
Come back to me
There would be a riot
Oh yeah, oooh


I'd be checkin' on my phone every minute
Waitin' 'round for it to start ringin'
And prayin' it would be you
I don't know what I'd do


There would be a riot
Breakin' of my heart, I'd try to fight it
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin'
If I said I could live and breathe
Without you
There'd be a lot of lonely
Wishin' and prayin' that you would hold me
I would do most anything baby if only
You would come back to me
Come back to me
There would be a riot
If I ever lost you
If I ever lost you


There would be a riot
Breakin' of my heart, I'd try to fight it
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin'
If I said I could live and breathe
There'd be a lot of lonely
Wishin' and prayin' that you would hold me
I would do most anything baby if only
You would come back to me
Come back to me
There would be a riot
If I ever lost you


There would be, there would be a riot
Breakin' of my heart, I'd try to fight it
There would be a riot
If I ever lost you

Give me this, give me that
Put it there, move it back
Dig me a hole, go fill it in
That don't look right, do it again

The boss man
He's been rubbing me wrong all day
But when I get home
My baby's gonna rub me the right way

Go get that ladder up on the hill
Hustle up, hold it still
What are you doing, standing around
Go build me something, go tear it down

The boss man
He's been rubbing me wrong all day
But when I get home
My baby's gonna rub me the right way

There ain't never been a woman
Any better at her loving
Than the one I'm gonna come home to
Darling, move a little closer, just a little lower
That's where it's at, I don't hold back
You've got it honey just like that

Boss man
He's been rubbing me wrong all day
But when I get home
My baby's gonna rub me the right way

Go break for lunch, get back to work
The same old grind, the same old jerk
Go change that tire, out on that truck
One of these days, I'll jack him up

The boss man
He's been rubbing me wrong all day
But when I get home
My baby's gonna rub me the right way

There ain't never been a woman any better at her loving
Than the one I'm gonna come home to
Darling, move a little closer, just a little lower
That's where it's at, I don't hold back
You've got it honey just like that

Boss man
He's been rubbing me wrong all day
But when I get home
My baby's gonna rub me the right way

Yeah, the boss man
He's been rubbing me wrong all day
But when I get home
My baby's gonna rub me the right way

There's a red brick in a white wall
Somebody's brush forgot to paint
So it sits there all alone
Like a hopeful sinner
Who finally goes to church
She don't sit among the christians
Cause she questions her own worth
Oh she's lonely

(chorus)
Lonely like the way you left me
Nothing I know's gonna get me
Through, losing you
The worst of loves analogies

Are tangled up inside of me
But the only one that brings
Me to my knees
Is lonely
There's a man in his own prison
With a crime nobody knows
He has sentenced himself to life
Witn no pardon or parole
Oh he's lonely

(repeat chorus|solo|repeat chorus)
I'm a red brick in a white wall
Somebody's brush forgot to paint
Lonely

(Jim Collins/Dean Dillon)

He was walkin' in the parkin' lot
When she finally caught up with him
Said: "Hey, boy, you forgot your keys
"Is that your car?" She ran her fingers 'cross the hood
An' told him: "I've never been in one of these."
He said: "Hop in an' I'll take you for a ride
"Around the block. If you got the time."
She said, as she took her apron off:
"I must be out of my mind."

He pushed a button an' the ragtop came down
Pushed another an' the music came on
Pushed it to the floor an' off they went
She asked his name: he told her
He asked her name: she told him
Said: "You wanna head back?" She said: "Not yet
"It feels good to have the sun on my face
"An' the wind blowin' through my hair
He said: "Where to next?"
An' she said: "I don't care."

"I've never been anywhere, I've never done anything
"'Cept wait on tables in that bar: small talk an' small change
"I've never loved anyone, I've never had someone who care
"Boy, until you came along: I've never been anywhere."

They drove around for what seemed for hours
In the sky the sun was settin'
Said: "Where do you live? I'll drive you home."
He walked her up to the front porch screen door
On her lips, she felt his kisses
He said: "Goodbye." She said: "So long."
Well, he got in his car an' drove away
But then he stopped an' threw it in reverse
An' she came runnin' off that front proch
An' he put his arms 'round her

"I've never been anywhere, I've never done anything
"But work in some dead-end job, chasin' after dead-end dreams
"But, girl, you brought my life to life, your smile is like a breath of air
"Yeah, until you came along: I've never been anywhere
"I've never been anywhere."

He was walkin' in the parkin' lot
When she finally caught up with him
Said: "Hey, boy, you forgot your keys."


That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red


Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it


Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry


If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up
I'll tell 'em every little detail, how you drug me through the mud
I'm gonna string up your old button-down and slide it on the porch
Just in case you get the nerve to come knockin' on my door


Yeah, I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry


Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it


Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry


(Out to dry)
(To the line)
(To the line)

Took my last fall in San Diego
Bus headed north one headed south
I call a farm in Colorado
And I lift a dusty pay phone to my mouth

She says hello I say it's me hon
Sorry I stayed away so long
Tell the kids thier old man's through with playin' rodeo
Cause if it's alright with you I'm comin' home

Well there's silence on the line
She says you sure did take your time
But I still need a man for the things a man is good for
You know how it is raisin' crops and raisin' kids
Demands a man at least as fit as you are
So come on git on home there's hay that needs a mowin'
A boy that needs a whippin' and a hundred things to do
I hope you've finally found your mind
To leave that rodeo behind
I've spent half my life just waitin' here for you

I guess that nows the time I'd better tell her
Hon I've got this old friend that's here with me
He used to be a cowboy and a good one so they say
But now his legs are crippled he can't walk you see
But hon you ought to hear him tell his stories
Sing the old songs play the guitar too
I'd really like to show him Colorado
But I thought I'd better leave it up to you

Well there's silence on the line
And now I hear her sayin'
Babe I only need a man for the things a man is good for
And you know how it is a place just half this big
Demands a man at least as fit as you are
Put yourself in his place it'd awful hard to face
All the chores and work and nothing he could do
If you want to know my mind leave that rodeo bum behind
Don't waste our time I'm waitin' here for you

Well cryin's just for kids I put down the phone
Fumble with my crutches movin' slow
I wish that I was on the bus that's Colorado bound
And I hope the weather's nice in Mexico


It's Friday after 5, got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobber's in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than cane
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down


We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down...here


Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, even hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down


We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here


Somebody pass that fifth of Camp this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down


We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here


She's got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees


She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is


You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
There's just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife




When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable




Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the hearts of all people
Both near and afar
Christmas everywhere
Feel the love of the season where ever you are
On the small country roads
Lined with green mistletoe
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow


Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing
Let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas, Christmas everywhere


Let it be Christmas everywhere
With the gold and the silver, the green and the red
Christmas everywhere
In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds
In the eyes of young babies
Their first fallen snow
The elderly's memories that never grow old




Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the songs that we sing
And the gifts that we bring
Christmas everywhere
In what this day means
And what we believe
From the sandy white beaches
Where blue water rolls
Snow covered mountains and valleys below




Christmas everywhere


You say you're doing better
For your sake
I hope it's true

I wish you well
But that's all that I can do
Save your I'm sorries
Just leave 'em at the door
You can't make me feel guilty anymore


You say
I should stay with you
That Jesus forgives you

You pray I will
But I won't
The difference is Jesus loves you
I don't


I know it sounds cruel
And it's really not like me
But you've put me in a place
I never thought I'd be

These tears that I'm cryin'
Are just tears of goodbye
I hope you find someone else
Somewhere in your life




I don't wanna know
You still want me
Don't need to hear
You can't sleep
No, I don't
No, I don't



I've been hurryin', I've been worryin'
I've been runnin' against the wind
I've been bettin' my soul on a long shot roll
That a good man never wins

I've been tossin', and I've been turnin'
I've been burnin' it at both ends
I've been seein' myself in the rear view
And I don't like where I've been...

So I'm takin' my time...
Holdin' and hopin' and drivin'
And dreamin' and lovin' every minute of it
Just enjoyin' the ride...
Slowly and soulfully feeling the wheels unwind
Finding my way back home..

I've been toolin' along the two lane
I got off of the interstate
I've been goin' too fast
I got off of the gas
I've been learnin' the charm of the brake

I've been rollin' down all the windows
And lettin' the world rush in
The smell of the grass and the fields that I pass
And the sun dance on my skin

So I'm takin' my time...
Holdin' and hopin' and drivin'
And dreamin' and lovin' every minute of it
Just enjoyin' the ride...
Slowly and soulfully feeling the wheels unwind
Finding my way back...

I'm takin' my time...
Holdin' and hopin' and drivin'
And dreamin' and lovin' every minute of it...

I'm takin' my time...
Holdin' and hopin' and drivin'
And dreamin' and lovin' every minute of it
Just enjoyin' the ride...
Slowly and soulfully feeling the wheels unwind
Slowly and soulfully feeling the wheels unwind
Finding my way... back... home...
I'm finding my way back home...


Hey, baby, it's been a minute since
Me and you got caught up in
A little wild and young kinda reckless love
That song that was playing when we first kissed
Yeah, you probably don't think I remember it
Got it in the truck
I can dial it up


Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it


Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moon shine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back


Baby, don't try to hide that smile
I can see that memory in your mind
Running all around, we can chase it down
You look even better than you did back then
Girl, close your eyes and we'll be there in no time
And we can rewind it


Way, way, back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back


Like an old school song
Two of us just hanging on to the night
Wouldn't you like to go there, baby?


Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it


Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back


Front row center in that little white church
I was singing at a baby laying in a manger
Eight years old wearing angel wings
Yeah, and to this day, that's what you see


I've been daddy's little girl since my first cry
And it was hard turning eighteen, saying goodbye
You told me I was gonna take the world by storm
And mama said you cried all the way home


You think I'm strong, you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm in my weakest
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am


I got my flaws and I've got regrets
And I know there's more on the road ahead
When I wonder if I'll ever measure up
Oh, I thank God for a father's love


Cause you think I'm brave, and you think I'm beautiful
You think that I can do the impossible
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am


Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
The girl you think I am, yeah ooh
Ooh, yeah


All I want, more than anything
Is to make you proud of me


Cause you think I'm strong, and you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm at my weakest
You believe in me
Yeah, you're my biggest fan
So I wanna be the girl you think I am
I wanna be the girl you think I am

They were sitting on his tailgate
And she was lovin' on his rough neck
And she was talking about running away
And he was puffin' on a cigarette
Just thinkin' (huh)
How am I gonna say goodbye?

He said, girl you got it good here
And you don't need to mess with
A guy going nowhere
She said how's about Texas?
He got up and shook his head
Then he said, ain't you been listening?
It's never gonna work out
And I think it'd be a good time now to

Let me go
You don't need me baby
Stop holding on the way you are
Don't you know I'm no good for you
And it'll only break your heart
If you don't
Let me go

He said other than a dreamer
I ain't nothin' but a drifter
You could do a lot better
Then leaned over and he kissed her
He said you got another year of college
And a good momma and a daddy
And me, I got $93 in this old '82 Chevy

So let me go
You don't need me baby
Stop holding on the way you are
Don't you know I'm no good for you
And it'll only break your heart
If you don't
Let me go

She said, nice try
But you can't hide behind those shades there on your face
Ya see I don't think you're all that tough
I just think you're scared of love
And I think I won't take up that much space

(So)Let me go
Take me with you baby
It's so cold outside your arms/I belong where you are (DEPENDING ON SONG VERSION)
We both know that you're not as strong as you think you are

So let me go
Take me with you baby
I belong where you are
Don't you know I'm so good for you
And it'll only break your heart
Down the road
If you don't
Let me go
With you baby

Let me go
With you baby
Just let me go

It ain't in a high rise looking for a good time shutting down the city lights
It ain't in the water floating like a bobber soaking up that hot sunshine
As good as it gets, no that ain't where it is
It's at 2 am when she's reaching' over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that's where
Yep yep, that's where it's at
It ain't in a suped-up shiny red new truck, if she ain't to my right
It ain't in a dive bar, tall can of PBR, poppin' tops rockin all night
As good as it gets, no that ain't where it is
It's at 2 am when she's reaching' over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that's where
Yep yep, that's where it's at
No, it don't matter wherever we're at (no...)
No, it don't get no better than that
It ain't in a suped-up shiny red new truck, if she ain't to my right
It's at 2 am when she's reaching' over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that's where
Yep yep, that's where it's at
Yeah, that's where it's at
Yep, yep, (that's where it's at)
2 AM when she's reaching' over
Faded t-shirt hanging off her shoulder (that's where it's at)


Smiles in the morning
As warm as sunshine
Kisses when I lay down at night
And 2 loving arms
To console me
I should be scared, it's so right


But, too much of a good thing
Is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And, too much of a good thing
Is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on


You look in my eyes
And see my thinking
I know when you're happy, when you're sad
Someone said
It's too perfect
But, I don't think what we have is so bad




And we've got a good thing going on


Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf


Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no


I bought a ring and she said, "I do"
But everybody else said, "Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?"
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man


Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no


I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
"You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen"
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?


Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no


Sometimes you've got to take the heat
If you're going to walk down on the mean street
Take the heat and you see it through
Because sometimes it comes down to
Do what you got to do
Sometimes it goes right down to the wire
And you might have to walk through the fire
Walk on, boy all the way through
Sometimes it just comes down to
Do what you got to do
Well, there's people that'll tell you
It's just no use
And there's people that'll tell you
That you're going to lose
People that'll tell you
Anything you're going to listen to
Do what you got to do
Someday they're going to call your name
They'll come looking for some one to blame
What's your name, boy
Hey, you just tell them true
Because they can't take the truth from you
So do what you got to doWell, they'll call you a hero or a traitor
But you'll find out that, sooner or later
Nobody in this world is going to do it for you
Do what you got to do


There is nobody in this world
That's going to do it for you
Do what you got to do

"A broken bat in the grass
Takin' one too many fastballs
Tired of swingin'

Spin the wheels, grindin' gears
Goin' nowhere in a downpour
Mud just slingin'

That's what it feels like
Climbin' uphill all the way
Like life's a wild horse
I ain't ever gonna break

If you didn't love
If you didn't love
If you didn't love me
(Then)(Well) I don't know how
I don't know how
If I could do this
If you didn't love
If you didn't love
If you didn't love me
I don't know how
I don't know how I'd get through this
If I didn't love
If I didn't love
If I didn't love
I don't know how
I don't know how
I'd get through this
If you didn't love
If you didn't love me

A mountain top, another shot
I'm born again
And put some fight back in me
Sunrise, oh yeah

That's what it feels like
Wakin' up in your arms, girl
Withoght your sweet smile
This would be a tougher world

If you didn't love
If you didn't love
If you didn't love me
(Well)(Then) I don't know how
I don't know how
I could do this
If you didn't love me
If you didn't love me
If you didn't love me

Sometimes it feels like
I'm runnin' straight into the wind
You whisper three words
And it's at my back again
Yeah, it's at my back again

Chorus


We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on the top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house, a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time, back in eighty nine


We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet


This old guitar taught me how to score, right there on the Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more about wanting what you can't have
Sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all, we never dreamed it wouldn't last
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine


We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet


We all kind of went our separate ways, but I swear it seems like yesterday


We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

I don't buy the lines in magazines
That tell me what I've gotta be
I don't base my life on a movie screen
I don't fit the mold society has planned
I don't need to be 19 years old
Or starve myself for some weight I'm told
Or turn men's heads down that road
And I thank God I finally know just who I am
I ain't a movie star may never see the view from where they are
And this old town may be as far as I'm goin'
And what he'll hold tonight in his hands
He swears there's so much better than
Anything that this old world can show him
I'm a real live woman
In love with this man I see lyin' here next to me
Lost in the way that he's holdin'
This real live woman
In the arms of a man where I'll fall asleep
Knowin' there's nothin' on earth he loves more than
This real live woman
I work 9-5 and I can't relate
To millionaires who somehow fate
Has smiled upon and fortune made their
Common lives a better place to be
And I no longer justify
Reasons for the way that I behave
I offer no apologies
For the things that I believe and say
And I like it that way
'Cause I'm a real live woman
In love with this man I see lyin' here next to me
Lost in the way that he's holdin'
This real live woman
In the arms of a man where I'll fall asleep
Knowin' there's nothin' on earth he loves more than
This real live woman


Weather man said, it’s gonna snow
By now I should, be used to the cold


Mid-February shouldn’t be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me


But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you


Living alone, here in this place
I think of you, and I’m not afraid


Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn’t mean to give them to me


But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you


It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone


Cause you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you


You're not supposed to say the word "cancer" in a song
And telling folks Jesus is the answer can rub them wrong
It is not hip to sing about tractors, trucks, little towns, and mama, yeah that might be true
But this is country music and we do


Do you like to drink a cold one on the weekend and get a little loud
Do you want to say I'm sorry or I love you but you don't know how?
Do you wish somebody had the nerve to tell that stupid boss of yours
To shove it next time he yells at you?
Well this is country music and we do


So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song
Yeah this is country music


Are you haunted by the echo of your mother on the phone
Crying as she tells you that your brother is not coming home?
And if there's anyone that still has pride and the memory of those
That died defending the old red, white, and blue
This is country music and we do


So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song
Just like a road that takes you home
Yeah this is right where you belong
This is country music
This is country music
He Stopped Loving Her Today
Hello Darling
God Bless the USA

Country Boy Can Survive


You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that, "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew


And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say, hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing)
And that was the moment I knew


What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?


You should've been here
And I would've been so happy


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


You call me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew


I couldn't help but notice you were sitting by yourself
Dropping limes in a Corona like you're trying to get over somebody else
It's funny how your story sounds a little like mine
Oh, cause' I've been at a table with a bottle peeling labels to pass the time


We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad up songs all night
We can say goodbye, just head home
But if we're gonna be alone


We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together


I couldn't help but notice you could use another drink
Yeah, I don't wanna leave ya
And it's two for one Tequila, so what you think?


We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad up songs all night
We can say goodbye, just head home
But if we're gonna be alone


We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together
We should be alone together
We should be alone together, oh yeah


We should be alone together
Over there in the corner where nobody else can see


We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together
We should be alone together
We should be alone together, oh yeah
We should be alone together


I came up out of the water
Raised my hands up to the Father
Gave it all to him that day
Felt a new wind kiss my face
Walked away, Eyes wide open
Could finally see where I was going
It didn't matter where I'd been
I'm not the same man I was then


I got off track
I made mistakes
Back slid my way
Into that place
Where souls get lost
Lines get crossed
And the pain won’t go away
I hit my knees
Now here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Here I am
Changed


I got a lot of “Hey, I’m sorry's"
The things I’ve done
Man, that was not me
I wish that I could take it all back
I just want to tell em’ that
Tell 'em that




I'm changed for the better
More smiles, less bitter
I'm even starting to forgive myself


I hit my knee
I’m here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Here I am, Here I am, Here I am
Changed
Yes I am
I’m changed for the better
Thank God I'm changed

Here we are making all our big plans
Jumping way into the deep end
Hey girl, why don't we just leave tonight
Pack it up drive until the road ends

Feels like this can be the moment
We've been waiting on all our lives
We know we're ready
It may sound crazy

'Cause we got no money
Nothing on our own, honey
Got your daddy all worried
'Cause times are tough

We got love, baby
It don't sound like much maybe
There ain't no way that's not enough
'Cause we got us

They say life's not a love song, I think everybody's all wrong
So far, forever sounds good to me
We've got California moonlight
Enough gas to make it to the sunrise

And two hearts believing
That's all we'd need
Nothing here's missing
This is what I call living

'Cause we got no money
Nothing of our own, honey
Got your daddy all worried
'Cause times are tough

We got love, baby
It don't sound like much maybe
There ain't no way that's not enough
We got us

Oh, we've come too far to turn around
Nothing can stop us, not now
Someday we're gonna laugh
At the way things used to be

When we had no money
Nothing of our own, honey
We had your daddy all worried
'Cause times were tough

We got love, baby
It don't sound like much maybe
There ain't no way that's not enough
'Cause we got us, 'cause we got us, yeah, yeah


She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything
She's I want a piece of chocolate
Take me to a movie
She's I can't find a thing to wear
Now and then she's moody


She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving


And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
Cause she's everything to me


She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy


She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
And my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing


And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
Cause she's everything to me


She's the voice I love to hear
Someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me
Everyday that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for


And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah she's everything to me


Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me




If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears
If I could
Light the world
We could sit
And watch it burn
We could fall asleep inside the glow


So tell me what I got to do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Oh


If I could
Take you in
Feeling you deep
Beneath my skin
Then I could
Slip away
With you as a poison in my veins
I don't want to fall asleep alone
And wake up knowing that I died without the one


So tell me what I got to do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Oh
So tell me what I got to do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Oh


If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears

This desert wind is burnin' my face again
God I'm missin' you
Been runnin' blind under a broken sky
With regrets I was sorting through
But lesson learned baby
I've made the turn

Wherever you are
No matter how far
Girl I'm gonna find my way to you
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are

So many miles to where we said goodbye
To the street of shattered dreams
I'm prayin' hard you didn't start a life
With someone who's not me
And if you're just gone
Girl I'll be movin' on

(Chorus)
Let the sunrise find me searchin'
Let the west wind carry my plea
Give this changed man one more last chance
Open your arms to me

Wherever you are
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-ho


Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around
Well, the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks


But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that


As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you


Before you know it, it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere


Baby, I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and
Knowing it's all gonna end


And as long I live, whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you


Yeah, looking at you, girl, standing there
Got your Wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby, I can tell


As long I live (as long as I live), whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

You say you need someone to love
But when will you learn
Whatever's done in this world
Is still gonna turn

Chorus:
Down comes the night, just another forever
How Long
How Long till you see that we're in this together
How long, how long

If you weren't so far away
So far from here
I'd make your tears go away
And make you see clear
You'd see a night when two hearts would surrender
How long
I don't want you to be the one I remember
How long, how long
Time goes by in the blink of an eye
It's passed over you
There's no time to hide, won't you stand by my side
I'm askin' you

Chorus

You say you need someone to love
But when will you learn
You say you need someone to love

This is for all you sophisticated ladies out there


She grew up in the city in a little subdivision
Her daddy wore a tie, mama never fried a chicken
Ballet, straight-As, most likely to succeed
They bought her a car after graduation
Sent her down South for some higher education
Put her on the fast track to a Law Degree
Now she's coming home to visit
Holding the hand of a wild-eyed boy
With a farmers tan


Shes riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Charlie Daniels, yelling, Turn it up!
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid
Ladies love country boys


You know mamas and daddies want better for their daughters
Hope they'll settle down with a doctor or a lawyer
And their uptown, ball gown, hand-me-down royalty
They never understand why their princess falls
For some camouflage britches and a southern-boy-drawl


She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Hank Jr., yelling, turn it up
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys


You can train them, you can try to teach them
Right from wrong but its still going to turn them on


She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Lynyrd Skynyrd, yelling, turn it up
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys


They love us country boys


I wear a greasy ball cap
I like my shirt untucked
I spend Saturdays working on my truck
I don't like to fight
But I aren’t scared to bleed
Most don't mess with a guy like me


Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe
That girls like you
Love guys like me


Your daddy worked at the bank
Mine worked on cars
You went to college
I pulled graveyard
You must have had your pick
Of all the trust fund types
But you came back to me and only God knows why


Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe
That girls like you
Love guys like me


Now there's a lot of guys like me out there
In a lot of little towns
And telling' all our buddies, we won't ever settle down
We say that’s just the way we are and the way we'll always be
So God sends girls like you for guys like me
Thank God there's girls like you, for guys like me


Here you go honey yeah here’s some Patron
You better sip it slow, it’s bad to the bone
Don’t want you getting too far gone
And I have to tote you out of here roll you on home
Keep on shaking that money maker
They’re just jealous just bunch of haters
The rest of this night’s going to be what we make it
There’s some wild in that smile baby what you say we take it


Off the beaten path
One foot on the dash and one on the floorboard
Off the beaten path
Country rock cranking through speakers in the four door
Silverado baby do you want to go
Out where the good love grows
Off the beaten path, yeah


I could sit right here and watch you dance all night
‘Til the sun comes up ‘til they turn out the lights
That drunk son of a buck’s ‘bout to have him a fight
If he don’t watch his step he’ll get a left then a right
What you mean you never sat in a jacked up truck
Well I’ll be damned girl you’re in luck
There’s a little spot out there I’d like to show you
By the light of the radio I’d like to get to get to know you




Like a deep groove country song baby
I want to turn you on, yeah




Off the beaten path
Baby let me take ya
Baby let me take ya
Baby let me take ya
Off the beaten path


I woke up in the front yard
In the back seat of a Buick
With the lights and the radio on
I stumbled across the grass
To the front porch through the door
Of a house that once was our home
If love once lived here you can't tell it
If I could just let go I'd sell it
Oh, I'm going under getting over you
Made my way down the hall
Through the boxes to the bed
Where I used to hold you all night long
Your perfume on the pillow
Where you once laid your head
Stays there to remind me you're gone
It's gonna tear me apart if I let it
I should just move on and forget it
But, I'm going under getting over you
The days are long and the nights are tough
All alone it's just too much
I'm not handling well what I'm going through
The whiskey ain't strong enough
My hearts down to giving up
I'm down to my last cigarette too
Oh, I'm going under getting over you


I remember thinking 'bout forever
Sitting there with you by the river
We danced in the little lights
And felt for the first time


I remember telling you I loved you
Northern star right above you
And in a moment I thought every dream
Would come true
Oh, we'll built some, just never do


Love comes in circles
And love takes its own time
Bending and breaking, not taking the street line
I never knew I never loved timeless and true
Oh, I did, yeah I did with you
Oh, I did, I did with you


Through the years just kept on the leading
Had to be a plan or a reason
But Heaven was silent and life just kept moving on
'Till my heart knew the moment was gone
Ohhhh


Love comes in circles
And love takes it's own time
Bending and breaking, not taking the street line
I never knew I never loved timeless and true
Oh, I did, yeah I did with you


Love is the reason why
Miracles never die
They just live on and on
Like a song, like a song
In the hearts of ones you leave behind
Ooh , yeah


Love comes in circles
And love takes it's own time
Bending and breaking, not taking the street line
I never knew I never loved timeless and true
But Oh, I did, yeah I did with you
Oh, I did yeah, I did with you

Leave it up to life
To bring a good woman down
It took three glasses of wine
Oh, but you're comin' 'round

Go on and let down your hair
Yeah, there's the girl I know
Let's leave the world out there
And lock the door, lock the door

Forget about the day you had
It's over, baby, let it be
Every little thing's gone bad
I know exactly what you need
Turn out the lights
And take it all out on me

Just bring the bottle to bed
Lay there and talk for awhile
And when everything has been said
Yeah, we're gonna find your smile

Forget about the day you had
It's over, baby, let it be
Every little thing's gone bad
I know exactly what you need
Turn out the lights
And take it all out on me

Forget about the day you had, yeah
It's over, baby, let it be
Every little thing's gone bad
And I know exactly what you need
Turn out the lights
And take it all out on me

Come on, baby
Take it all out on me, oh

(Steve Seskin/Mark Alan Springer)
The umpire had got sick so he said he'd give it a try
So there was my dad,callin' them balls and strikes
I can still hear the crack of the bat
I never got a hold of one like that
I was roundin' second when the third base coach
Took a big chance and wave me home
I'm pretty sure the ball touched me before I touched the plate
But when it's your dad,that's a hard call to make
For the most part,I think I made him proud
But there was one night,I know I let him down
I had known them boys all my life
I should've known better then to take that ride
The county sherriff was a friend of his
Said that's why he was bringin' me in
He handed me the phone,said "Sorry son,everybody makes mistakes"
But when it's your dad,that's a hard call to make
It's not easy as wrong or right
It ain't always black and white
Life's a thousand shades of grey
He had a plan for just about everything
An' he'd it known that if this day ever came
That he had lived a good long life
And he had always fought a good fight
So when the doctor said,"It's up to you"
I knew what I had to do
I read the form picked up a pen and my hand began to shake
'Cause when it's your dad,that's a hard call to make
It's not as easy as wrong or right
It ain't always black and white
Life's a thousand shades of grey


Had 'em all dressed in their Sunday best calling me dirty words
Had a few drive by shootin' me the bird
Night-stalking me, callin', my phone blowing up
Going all Carrie Underwood on my truck


They get crazy and mean
And everything in-between
You can't blame no one else
When you brought it all on yourself


Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get half-drunk, half-wild, and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you


Had 'em burn my clothes in a barrel in the front yard
Revenging and binging up my credit cards
Post pictures of me naked with my ink showing through
In the places no one knew there were tattoos


Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get half-drunk, half-wild, and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you


They go out of their heads
Hell, yeah, they get all red
But you can't blame no one else
When you brought it all on yourself


Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get half-drunk, half-wild, and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you


Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
When she goes all country on you

Nice truck, nice tan
That's what every girl loves but I love my man
Nice legs and nice strut
That's what every guy wants, but you want what I got

Now I slam that closet and run down the hall
Jump on the bed and bounce off the wall
I dance on the floor, kick open the door
When you walk into the room

My heart goes boom
Boom, boom, boom

I am the honey, you're the bee
I am the branch, you are the tree
I am the wave, you are the sea
Yeah, you are everything to me

I am your sun, you are my sky
You are the beauty to my eye
You are my wings, you make me fly
To every question, you're the why, oh

You're all that matters
Yeah, you're all that matters
You're all that matters to me

Nice touch, nice kiss
It's too good to be true when it feels like this
Nice hands, nice guns
When it gets this good, babe, it must be love

Now I slam that closet and run down the hall
Jump on the bed and bounce off the wall
I dance on the floor, kick open the door
When you walk into the room

My heart goes boom
Boom, boom, boom

I am the honey, you're the bee
I am the branch, you are the tree
I am the wave, you are the sea
Yeah, you are everything to me

I am your sun, you are my sky
You are the beauty to my eye
You are my wings, you make me fly
To every question, you're the why, oh

You're all that matters
Yeah, you're all that matters to me
You're all that matters to me

Now I slam that closet and run down the hall
Jump on the bed and bounce off the wall
I dance on the floor, kick open the door
When you walk into the room

My heart goes boom
Boom, boom, boom

I am the honey, you're the bee
I am the branch, you are the tree
I am the wave, you are the sea
Yeah, you are everything to me

I am you sun, you are my sky
You are the beauty to my eye
You are my wings, you make me fly
To every question, you're the why, oh

You're all that matters
Yeah, you're all that matters to me
You're all that matters to me


I knew the minute that I picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough
Barely made it out of your drive
Burn a little rubber at the red light
Got a little warning from the blue lights
It's only going 9 o'clock but feels more like midnight


We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight


Girl you already got the window down
And you got your seat laid back
I ain't even made it halfway to town
And you're already talking about a 6 pack
Already got your shoes off
And you talking about slipping off
No we ain't even found your friends saying
You already wanna get lost


We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight


Ain't had a drink and I'm tore up
Ain't even had a taste of your love
But girl the crazy thing is
We're just getting warmed up


We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight
And we're just getting started tonight

It's way too easy to live this life with your eyes half closed and don't I know
I spend half my time bored out of my mind sleepwalking
Well I wake up to this fools parade and I watch the leaves fall down
I see everything changin' but somehow i feel caged in, just hanging around

I'm waitin on the wonderful, Something to set me free
Out of the ordinary come and rescue me, ya I could use a little love
Love love to send me a sign i'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin on the wonderful

It's that feeling that's hard to explain
When the world's so big and your so small
And you get caught up in the wonder of it all that's what I miss
I saw that look today on a young kids face
Eating icecream at the laudrymat well if you'd asked
Him it was christmas again I want to get that back

I'm waitin on the wonderful, Something to believe,out of the ordinary
Taste of something sweet,ya I could use a little
Love love love to send me a sign i'm tired of the typical I'm waitin on the wonderful

Ya,ya i'm waitin the the wonderful.I know its out there

I'm waiton on the wonderful a little something to believe
Out of the ordinary come and rescue me I could use a little love
Love love to send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical waitin on the wonderful something mystical
Waitin on the wonderful i'm waitin on the wonderful something to set me free


'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life


Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight?
And ain't it sad
You can't forget about what we had?
Take a look at her and do you like what you see
Or do you wish it was me?


'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life


And does she know
Know about the times you used to hold me
Wrapped me in your arms and how you told me
I'd be the only one?
I heard about
Yeah, someone told me once when you were out
She went a little crazy, ran her mouth about me
Ain't jealousy funny?


'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life


Life with me was a fairytale love
I was head over heels 'til you threw away us
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life


I heard you're gonna get married, have a nice little family
Live out my dreams with someone new
But I've been told that a cheater is always a cheater
So I've got my pride and she's got you


'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life


Of your life, oh, oh yeah
You're gonna think of me
You're gonna think of me in your life
Oh, oh, yeah
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame


Everybody's reaching for something
Every day, pulling and tugging
And always wanting a little more
Holding onto hurt like an anchor
Treating those we love like strangers
Taking names and keeping score
We all know what we're really after
Somewhere along the road, we got it backwards


If you want to get love then give it
If you want to feel some forgiveness
Then you gotta let go and do some forgiving of your own
If you want a friend then be one
A little bit of kindness, show some
You'll be surprised at how much finds its way back home
It don't matter what it is
If you want it, give


I been downright stubborn
At one time or another
And found it easier to bend
I've had a shoulder to lean on
Been the one who got to be strong
And peace was waiting at both ends
I've felt the power, I've seen what it can do
It seemed so simple, so simple that it's true


If you want to get love then give it
If you want to feel some forgiveness
Then you gotta let go and do some forgiving of your own
If you want a friend then be one
A little bit of kindness, show some
You'll be surprised at how much finds its way back home
It don't matter what it is
If you want it, give
If you want a friend then be one
A little bit of kindness, show some
You'll be surprised at how much finds its way back home
It don't matter what it is
If you want it, give


Oh, show a little kindness, baby
If you want it, give


The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Your bags are packed not a word is spoken
I guess we said everything with good-bye
Time moves so slow and promises get broken
On this cold day in July


Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands
Here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away


You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
It looks like spring and
It feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July


Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands
Here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away


The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long how I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that
You would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Here comes that cold day in July


Oh
Yeah
Oh yeah
La da da la da da la da da
Oh Ooo


We got beer iced down in a cooler
Truck radio crankin' Hank Jr
Everybody's gettin' looser
Son, look what ol' Burley's got
Boys we're about to kick her up a notch
Well


Shine, straight from a mason jar
Shine, let's let the party start
Shine, we do it right in these parts
Everybody have a good time
Take a sip and pass it down the line
Shine


This old hayfield just came alive
Everybody's dancin' by the fireside
We're gonna be here all night
I think I've had a little too much
But its hard to have just enough
When you got


Shine, straight from a mason jar
Shine, let's let the party start
Shine, we do it right in these parts
Everybody have a good time
Take a sip and pass it down the line
Shine


That Carolina sun is risin' and were still standin'
Might as well kick off the mornin' with some


Shine, straight from a mason jar
Shine, let's let the party start
Shine, we do it right in these parts
Everybody have a good time
I said everybody have a good time
Shine, straight from a mason jar
Shine, let's let the party start
Shine, we do it right in these parts
Everybody have a good time
Take a sip and pass it down the line
Shine

I've got her photograph
On a stand by my bed
Two on the mantel
And thousands in my head
I can't believe how fast she's growing
It ain't suppose to be like this
Every time I look at her
I see how much I've missed
I missed her first steps
Her first words
I love you daddy
Is something I seldom hear
Oh it hurts me so
To watch my girl grow
Up in pictures

I send the money down
I do my best to do my part
But it can't compare
With what I pay with my heart
There's still unanswered questions
That weigh heavy on my mind
Will she ever understand the reasons why

I missed her first steps
Her first words
I love you daddy
Is something I seldom hear
Oh it hurts me so
To watch my girl grow
Up in pictures

It takes all I have
To keep the tears inside
What I wouldn't give if
I could turn back time

I missed her first steps
Her first words
I love you daddy
Is something I seldom heard
Oh it hurts me so
To watch my baby grow
Up in pictures


Girl, you know I love talking to you on the phone
I could listen to your sweet voice all night long
Sometimes I can get by with a sweet dreams baby good night
But this time, well, I don't wanna spend it alone


So I'm coming over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pulling into your drive
Look out your window—you'll see my lights
Baby girl, I gotta see you tonight
The way the breeze is blowing, blowing
Got me wishing I was holding, holding
Holding you so tight under that porch light
But girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight
Girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight


I got a couple hundred pictures of your pretty face
On my phone, on my dash—all over the place
But I would drive a million miles
Just to see that little smile in real life
Baby, it's worth the drive
You're worth the drive


So I'm coming over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pulling into your drive
Look out your window—you'll see my lights
Baby girl, I gotta see you tonight
The way the breeze is blowing, blowing
Got me wishing I was holding, holding
Holding you so tight under that porch light
But girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight
Girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight


No, I don't care what time it is
I just gotta get a little moonlight kiss
Girl, I can't help it when I feel like this
There's only one thing to do
Baby, I'm missing you


So I'm coming over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pulling into your drive
Look out your window—you'll see my lights
Baby girl, I gotta see you tonight
The way the breeze is blowing, blowing
Got me wishing I was holding, holding
Holding you so tight under that porch light
But girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight
Girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight

If you wanna climb a ladder on a water tower
Then we'll kick it with the stars for a couple hours
If you wanna then we're gonna get way up high
If you wanna dip your toes where the water stops
Then we'll let our feet hang off a fishin' dock
If you wanna then we're gonna have to give it a try, that's right

If you wanna go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to fallin' down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

You had a Corona, I was drinking Bud Light
That jukebox singing every song just right that night
Something brewing in the air, and it was more than just smoke
Looking back, looking back after two you laughed at all my jokes
Tonight lets raise 'em up to where we ended up


There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been some smiles then there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer

Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer


I didn't have much money, but I covered them rounds
Cause a pretty girl like you makes a fella throw his money down
You weren’t shooting on whiskey, just shooting the shit
I paid the tab we walked out the door, I remember thinking this was it
Yeah, you were it


There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been more smiles than there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer


Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
Here’s to you baby
So tonight lets raise ‘em up to where we ended up


There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been more smiles than there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer

Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer

Well baby, there ain't no maybe about it
I ain't made of money
So I know that you ain't hangin round for that
If it grew on trees
The branches on mine wouldn't have no leaves
On a shoe-string, saving every dime we made
No Cadillac cruising, no boat on a lake
Out in no-man's-land on an old two-lane
Yeah but we like it that way

It's good to be us
Good to be breathing
Day after night after day, this feeling
Feels the way it should
If this is as good as it gets, then good
It's good to be us

Aw, give me this air and give me this land
When I lay down at night girl, give me your hand
I can take any hurt this world has to give
As long as I got you, as long as I live
I'll make your life as sweet as I can
I'll move every mountain to be that man
That gives you space and a place to land
You wake up smiling, knowing that

It's good to be us
Good to be breathing

Day after night after day, this feeling
Feels the way it should
If this is as good as it gets, then good

It's better than best, yeah we got it made
In the shade, in the sun, in love this way - yeah
We got lucky baby, we've been blessed
Couldn't ask for more, wouldn't settle for less
It's good to be us, yeah, it's good to be us

It's good to be us
Good to be breathing

Feels the way it should

Baby, it's good to be us
So good to be us


Yeah the big boss man, he likes to crack that whip
I am not nothing but a number on his timecard slip
I give him 40 hours and a piece of my soul
Puts me somewhere at the bottom of his totem pole
Hell I do not even think he knows my name


Well all week long I am a real nobody
But I just punched out and it is pay check Friday
Weekends here, good God almighty
I am going to get drunk and be somebody
Yeah, yeah, yeah


My baby cuts hair at a beauty boutique
Just blowing and going till she dead on her feet
They walk right in and sit right down
She gives them what they want and then she spins them around
Hey I do not think they even know her name


How week long she's a real nobody
But I just punched her out and it is pay check Friday
Weekends here, good God almighty
Baby let's get drunk and be somebody
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Well just average people, in an everyday bar
Driving from work in our ordinary cars
And I like to come here with the regular Joes
Drink all you want, be the star of the show


How week long but you're a real nobody
But we just punched her out and it is pay check Friday
Weekends here, good God almighty
People let's get drunk
How week long but you're a real nobody

Weekends here, good God almighty

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Tell me what I have to do tonight
'Cause I'd do anything to make it right
Let's be us again

I'm sorry for the way I lost my head
I don't know why I said the things I said
Let's be us again

Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us again

Oh us again

Look at me, I'm way past pride
Isn't there some way that we can try
To be us again
Even if it takes a while
I'll wait right here until I see that smile
That says we're us again

Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us

Baby baby what would I do
I can't imagine life without you

Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in

Oh, here I am
I'm reaching out for you
So won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us again

Oh let's be us again


She grew up around here, on that southwest side
Where the corn grows, up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night


She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot, where she came from


I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl


Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl, but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night


I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl




She's got an old soul
She's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street


I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl


I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl ...


Yes, she blew through the door like TNT
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me
Said: "I'm a whiskey drinking, cowboy chasing, helluva time
"I like Kenny, Keith, Allan and Patsy Cline
"I'm a full grown Queen Bee looking for honey
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."
Yeah, the band took a break
The DJ played P Diddy
She said: "I didn't come here to hear
"Something thumping from the city."
Said: "I, I shaved my legs, I paid my money
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."


Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."


Yeah, the bartender yelled: "Y'all, it's closing time."
She got this wild look on her face
An' said: "Your truck or mine
"I know a place down the road
"It's kinda funky
"Ha-ooh-hoo, all out in the country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play something country."


Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

Thought you'd change the weather
Start a little storm
Make a little rain
But I'm going to do one better hide the sun until you pray
I'm a tornado, looking for a soul to take


You're going to see me coming by the selfish things that you did
I'm going to leave you guessing how this funnel is going to hit
I'm a tornado, looking for a man to break


Yeah, I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found


Thought you'd take a swing
Try another girl, try another night
But it's the pain that brings my force of nature back to life
I'm a tornado more disturbed than an F5


Hey, I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found, oh, yeah


OOOOOOOOOOO
MMMMMMMMMM


I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found


The winds are getting stronger
And the sky is falling through
And you ain't got much longer
Til the rage rips off the roof
I'm a tornado... and I'm coming after you...


Oooo...
Hmm...
Oooo...


(I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground)


Got nowhere to go and all night to get there
But I'm going there with you
Tonight we're running on luck
If we're gonna use it all up
There's only one thing left to do


Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone


You look way too good
And this feels way too right
It'd been way too long to start
And it's sure worth drinking to
So baby here's to you
I don't wanna waste a drop


Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone


One life, one chance
One ticket to the big dance
You and me still holding on
Right down to the last song


Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Yeah, 'til it's gone


You're sure worth drinking to
Baby, here's to you
I don't wanna waste a drop


I'm gonna drink it all up
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone, it's gone


Song Number 1, yeah, that's the one
That was bumpin' outta the speakers
Everybody knew the words
Everybody sang along
Everybody could see her
And the sweet melody of song number 3
Had her slidin' on over to me...but


Song number 7
Took me all the way to heaven that night
Song number 7
Cranked up to eleven set the mood just right
I was holding her tight
She had her hands in the air
She was fallin' in love and I was already there
Song number 7


There were stars in the sky sparks in her eyes
And the smell of hickory burnin'
Everybody there just disappeared like it was only me and her and
The midnight blue behind a red dirt moon
Had me caught up in the groove...of


Song number 7
Took me all the way to heaven that night
Song number 7
Cranked up to eleven set the mood just right
I was holding her tight
She had her hands in the air
She was fallin' in love and I was already there
Song number 7


Everytime we wanna go back
We just hit that track
Song number 7... Yeah it was


Song number 7
Took me all the way to heaven that night
Song number 7
Cranked up to eleven set the mood just right
I was holding her tight
She had her hands in the air
She was fallin' in love and I was already there
Song number 7

Song number 7
Yeah it was song number 7

I just left Bobby's house:
The service was today
Got me thinkin' about how fragile life is
As I drove away
You know Amy was his only love
In a moment she was gone, long gone:
It could have been me or you
Oh, baby, there's no time to lose

So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses
An' pour us a glass of wine
An' I'm gonna put on a little music
An' turn down the lights
An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you
An' rock you all through the night
An' I'm gonna love you
Like it's the last day of my life

I drive off when the sun comes up:
I get back when it's gone down
There's so much I wanna do with you
But I can't be around
Whoa, time has been just like a thief
It's stolen too much from us
So once it's gone we can't make it up
So tonight, let's get back in touch

I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses
An' pour us a glass of wine
An' I'm gonna put on a little music
An' turn down the lights
An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you
An' rock you all through the night
An' I'm gonna love you
Like it's the last day of my...

Life is a rainbow, it's a spring snow
It's the mornin' dew
An' I don't wanna waste another minute
Without you

So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses
An' pour us a glass of wine
An' I'm gonna put on a little music
An' turn down the lights
An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you
An' rock you all through the night
An' I'm gonna love you
Like it's the last day of my life
I'm gonna love you
Like it's the last day of my life
Oh, oh

You’ve got a cousin who’s telling you somethin’
That doesn’t have nothin’ to do with the lovin’ that we’re in, baby
I hear she’s sayin’ this game we’re playin’ should be complicated
If you won’t, I’ll say it, I think she’s crazy, cause

Love don’t have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs, crying in the rain
It’s all right to keep it light now mama, don’t you think
We’re having such a good time together and it’s only just begun
My heart’s never smiled so hard
Baby, lovin’ you is fun
It’s fun

I’m walking around all over this town, ten feet off the ground
So happy I found you, baby, I love it
There’s no self-help book on your shelf, you know too well
They’re trying to sell you somethin’ for nothin’, cause

Love don’t have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs, crying in the rain
It’s all right to keep it light now mama, don’t you think
We’re having such a good time together and it’s only just begun
My heart’s never smiled so hard
Baby, lovin’ you is fun

Love don’t have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs, crying in the rain
It’s all right to keep it light now mama, don’t you think
We’re having such a good time together and it’s only just begun
My heart’s never smiled so hard
Baby, lovin’ you is fun

This ole heart’s never smiled so hard
Lovin’ you is fun
Yeah it’s fun
Yeah it’s fun
Lovin’ you is fun


Girl you're beautiful
You're bout near perfect
But I bet somebody's already told you that
Name your poison
Name your passion
Because a boy like me just couldn't help but ask
Keep on talking to me baby
I'm hanging on your every word
Keep those drinks a coming maybe
We'll both get what we deserve


How bout baby
We make a promise
To not promise anything more than one night
Complicated situations
Only get worse in the morning light
Hey I'm just looking for a good time


Put in a long hard week doing this 9 to 5
And you're just the girl to get that off my mind
You shouldn't have worn that dress
You shouldn't dance like that
You got this little heart of mine in overdrive
I sure love this conversation
The band is good, the music's loud
But would you get the wrong impression
If I called us a cab right now? Oh yeah

Chorus]


Go ahead and lie to me and pull me close
Tell me that you love me even if you don't
The rule is don't you ever even talk about forever
But you never say never in life




Hey I'm just looking for a good time

The wait turned into hours
Before you came my way
The smile that filled a daddy's heart
On the special day
The moment left me speechless
I didn't know what to say
Then you took your first breath
That took mine away

Days go by so quickly
Summer turns to fall
Seems like only yesterday
That you began to crawl
So don't be afraid to take that step
I'll catch you when you fall
I don't mind if you leave behind
A few handprints on the wall

I can't describe this feeling
Way down deep inside
The itsy-bitsy spider
Was the first thing that we tried
Patty cake, the baker's man
With your hands so very small
You could always stay this young
And I wouldn't mind at all

Days go by so quickly
Summer turns to fall
Seems like only yesterday
That you began to crawl
So don't be afraid to take that step
I'll catch you when you fall
I don't mind if you leave behind
A few handprints on the wall...

Out here on the back side of that city limit sign where the world turns two lanes
Pretty girl working at the bank and the fella topping off your tank knows your name
Water tower, power lines, swimming holes, rusty old RC Cola signs and county fairs
Raise your hand if you’ve been there

Where there’s biscuits, grits, and gravy
And the waitress calls you baby
And the star lights like a street light on a summer night
We say hell yeah and Amen, yeehaw and y’all come back again
And pray that our boys come home alive
And when ole glory flies we still hold our hands over our hearts
Where there’s more trucks than cars

Well, I’ve been there on the concrete of them big city streets in my Ford truck
Traffic jam in the town square, told my buddies living up there, good luck
Meanwhile back in Tennessee we’re raising our babies and our own green beans and kicking up dust
Come on down when you’ve had enough

Where there’s biscuits, grits, and gravy
And the waitress calls you baby
And the star lights like a street light on a summer night
We say hell yeah and Amen, yeehaw and y’all come back again
And pray that our boys come home alive
And when ole glory flies we still hold our hands over our hearts
Where there’s more trucks than cars

Where there’s biscuits, grits, and gravy
And the waitress calls you baby
And the star lights like a street light on a summer night
We say hell yeah and Amen, yeehaw and y’all come back again
And pray that our boys come home alive
And when ole glory flies we still hold our hands over our hearts
Where there’s more trucks than cars
Where there’s more trucks than cars

Yeah, you know I love you in a tight dress
But you’re, oh my God, slippin’ out of it
You turn me on, girl you know you do
But you tear me up even better in boots

We ain’t gotta worry ‘bout gettin’ dirty
We can do whatever we want
Baby put your Luccheses on
You know you want to
‘Cause we got a full moon
And it’s Friday night
Girl you got me so hooked
Ain’t nothin’ ever looked better in boots

Fair, girl it ain’t even fair
When all it takes is you lettin’ down your hair
To drive me wild like you know you do
It works every time but even better in boots

We ain’t gotta worry ‘bout gettin’ dirty
We can do whatever we want
Baby put your Luccheses on
You know you want to
‘Cause we got a full moon
And it’s Friday night
Girl you got me so hooked
Ain’t nothin’ ever looked better in boots

We ain’t gotta worry ‘bout gettin’ dirty
We can do whatever we want
Baby put them Luccheses on
You know you want to
‘Cause we got a full moon
And it’s Friday night
Girl you got me so hooked
Ain’t nothin’ ever looked better in boots
Girl you got me so hooked
Ain’t nothin’ ever looked better in them boots


I don't wanna be the one who's old before their time
And lose the wonder that I felt as a child
I can't run this race believing I might lose
There's still so much to see and so much left to do
Yes, I'll fall before I fly
But no one can say I never tried


Oh, we just get one ride around the sun
In this dream of time
It goes so fast, but one day we look back
And we ask, "Was that my life?"


I close my eyes and think how lucky I have been
To hold the ones I love and share my dreams with them
All those sunny days and all those starry skies
Good morning kisses and sweet goodnights
Oh, I can't tell them enough
Just how much that they are loved


Oh, you just get one ride around the sun
In this dream of time
It goes so fast that one day we look back
And we ask, "Was that my life?"
We just get one ride around the sun
In this dream of time
It goes so fast that one day we look back
And we ask, "Oh, was that my life?"


"Ooh, was that my life rollin' on by?"
Rollin', rollin', rollin, rollin' on by
Was that my life?
Mmmhmm
Was that my life?

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be far away

Here were are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Oh, Here were are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now...


I was born by a fire in a cold dark cave
In the age of the dinosaur
When the caveman caught his cave-woman lovin'
On the missin' link livin' next door
There was cryin' and screamin'
And war drums beating and a wave of violence
None of them folk survived but me
And I've been hangin' 'round ever since


'Cause I'm a heartache, never see me comin'
I'll always take you by surprise
I'm a heartache, hungry and huntin'
For someone I can eat alive
By the time you know I'm on you
Buddy, it's too late


I'm a heartache


I watched you takin' off tonight
And I knew where you were headed to
I saw that sweet young thing you met
At that dirty old motel room
Yeah, I'm gnawin' on your pretty little wife
Waitin' up for you at home
And you don't even know it but I'm just savin' you for later
When I can get you all alone


I'm a heartache, never see me comin'
I'll always take you by surprise
I'm a heartache, hungry and huntin'
For someone I can eat alive
By the time you know I'm on you
Buddy, it's too late


I'm a heartache


From Anthony and Cleopatra, Samson and Delilah
To Jackie and JFK
Elvis and Priscilla, Charles and Diana
I say I've had some pretty good days
You may not believe it but you and me, son
Are about to have some real fun
'Cause I'm comin', oh, I'm comin'


I'm a heartache, never see me comin'
I'll always take you by surprise
I'm a heartache, hungry and huntin'
Someone I can eat alive
By the time you know I'm on you
Buddy, it's too late


I'm a heartache


I'm a heartache
I'm a heartache

I'm still learning how to pray
Trying hard not to stray
Try to see things your way
I'm still learning how to pray
I'm still learning how to trust
It's so hard to open up
And I'd do anything for us
I'm still learning how to trust

I'm still learning how to bend
How to let you in
In a world full of tears
We'll conquer all our fears
I'm still learning how to fly
I wanna take you higher
I'll be there till the end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'm still learning how to bend

I'm just trying to understand
It's all in someone else's hands
There's always been a bigger plan
But I don't need to understand

I'm still learning how to bend
I wanna take you in
In a world full of tears
We'll conquer all our fears
I'm still learning how to fly
I wanna take you higher
I'll be there till the end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'm still learning how to bend

I'll be there till the end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'm still learning how to bend

I'm still learning how to bend
I'll be there till the end
I'm still learning how to bend

I swore that I was living free
Oh, you couldn't talk to me
And the pride that kept me, didn't want no company
Early morning subway train
Feeling lost and running late
Well, he held the car, he gave his seat to me

And I can't find nothing feels so fine as loving
A good hearted man
Oh he can soothe me, free me, oh I'm gonna marry
That good hearted man

I told him that he'd better go
'Cause I was crazy and impossible
That my love was broken, my dreams had run off wild
Patient as the easy rain
Oh he never turned away
Calling, "Hey sweet woman, you know you're not a child."

And I can't find nothing feels so fine as loving
A good hearted man
Oh he can soothe me, free me, oh I'm gonna marry
That good hearted man

Good hearted man, now the night makes sense
Because your tenderness is sheltering me

So I'm trading in that hothead kid
For a woman I can give to him
And it ain't easy, but I'm gonna do the best I can
For that good hearted man

You know there just ain't nothing feels so fine as loving
A good hearted man
Oh he can soothe me, free me, oh I'm gonna marry
That good hearted man
Oh and I'm grateful, grateful, got to say thank you
To a good hearted man


Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my mama off where she needed to go
Four bald tires, with the ceiling fallin' and the window stuck
But the only thing I cared about was the radio
We'd turn it on, turn it up to ten, and everybody would jump on in


Riding down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
Like a feel real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
Didn't have no money, no place to go
All we needed was a radio


I'd grab my girl, we'd look for somewhere to watch the stars
The perfect place to put it in park and take it slow
She'd sing along, to even the ones that she barely knew
She still sounded good, a little out of tune, but we didn't care
I'd look at her, she'd look at me, I'll never forget that melody




Shhh, hey y'all be quiet
That's my favorite song
Hey man turn it up loud
Come on, come on, come on

Riding down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
Like a feel real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
Didn't have no money, no place to go
All we needed was a radio


All we needed, all we needed now
Was a, was a, was a radio

We headed out to California
Everybody tried to warn us
Said we wouldn't make it any further
Than that worn out Chevy would

We broke down a time or two
Thought "maybe we didn't think it through"
We were all we had to turn to
When it wasn't lookin' good

We're lookin' back laughin'
'cause they called us crazy

(chorus)
We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly - had to get away
Took a chance on that feelin' - baby
We were lovin' blind - borderline reckless
We were livin' for the minute we were spinnin' in
Maybe we were a lot of things
But we weren't crazy

Just a couple kids a couple years ago
Now we gotta couple kids of our own
We turn out right - proved them wrong
Look at us goin' strong

Lookin' back laughin'
'cause they called us crazy

(repeat chorus)
Coulda set it down
When things got tough
Coulda walked away from this love
But that'd been crazy

We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly, had to get away
Took a chance on that feeling
We were lovin blind, borderline reckless
We were livin for the minute we were spinning in
Maybe we were a lot of things
Oh maybe we were a lot of things
But we werent crazy
We weren't crazy
We weren't crazy


I’ve cussed on a Sunday
I’ve cheated and I’ve lied
I’ve fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial


Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that’s my church


When Hank bring the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burning
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away


Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that’s my church


Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that’s my church


Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that’s my church
Yeah I guess that’s my church
Yeah I guess that’s my church


I dialed seven digits five times today
Just to hear you say you love or hate me
I'll take anything
I just wanna hear your voice
Cut through the line like a heart-shaped knife
Cut me down baby, one more time
Good or bad baby
Yes, no, maybe
It's driving me crazy


Won't you pick up the phone?
I can pick up some wine
I can pick you up in my pickup truck
And we can pick up right where we left off
Ain't that what we both want?
Pick up the pieces girl
It ain't that broke
Pick up the past and just let it go
Put down that over me-never wanna see me again-goodbye kinda stuff and pick up


You're putting me through hell one ring voicemail
Baby I can tell that you ain't on the other line
Accept or decline
How can I tell you if you won't listen?
How can I tell you what I've been missin'?
If you don't, don't, don't
If you won't, won't, won't


Won't you pick up the phone?
I can pick up some wine
I can pick you up in my pickup truck
And we can pick up right where we left off
Ain't that what we both want?
Pick up the pieces girl
It ain't that broke
Pick up the past and just let it go
Put down that over me-never wanna see me again-goodbye kinda stuff and pick up


Oh, pick up
Put down the mistakes we made
And the words we didn't mean to say


And pick up the phone
I can pick up some wine
I can pick you up in my pickup truck
And we can pick up right where we left off
Ain't that what we both want?
Pick up the pieces girl
It ain't that broke
Pick up the past and just let it go
Put down that over me-never wanna see me again-goodbye kinda stuff and pick up
Baby pick up


I dialed seven digits five times today
Just to hear you say you love or hate me (love or hate me)
I just wanna hear your voice


Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways


I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her


I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waiting on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights


I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him


I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same, how have you been?
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way


I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home
I just called to say I love you
Come back home

Songwriters:  Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow

Afternoon low tide, workin' my plan
Got one hand in the water, the other in the sand
Two beers in a cooler, one warm heart in place
Got a picture in a bottle, one nailed up to a palm tree
One out in the wind and they all look like me
I want somebody to be the feeling's all over my face

Oh, I've never been more ready than I am right now
I know sooner or later, someday, somehow
Somebody's gonna walk up
An' join somebody sittin' right here
So wherever, whoever you are
The coast is clear

I close my eyes and the sound of the waves
Carries me forward to better days
An' they open my eyes to the woman of my dreams strolling in
With a small touch of shyness an' a smooth kind of style
She kisses me on the cheek and she says with a smile:
"I've been waiting all my life for you, baby. Where have you been?"

Oh, I've never been more ready than I am right now
I know sooner or later, someway, somehow
Somebody's gonna walk up
An' join somebody sittin' right here
So wherever, whoever you are
The coast is clear

Girl, wherever, whoever you are
The coast is clear

Afternoon low tide, I'm just workin' my plan
Right now, right here
The coast is clear
Oh, yeah


When I picked you up for our first date baby
Well, your pretty blue eyes, they were driving' me crazy
And the tiny little thought that was so amazing
Is they were looking at me
I held open the car door for you then you climbed
Inside and slid on over
To the other side.. I thought my, oh my


Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing


Yeah I know I'm gonna see you first thing tomorrow
But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow
Uncle Jake's mustang, its his favorite car
And so I can't stay long..
Standing here feeling like a love struck Romeo
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little
More time, is that such a crime?


Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing


Sweet thing, sweet thing


Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing


Oh come-on sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing


Yeah, come-on now a little now..
Do do do do do do do do do do do
Oh my little sweet thing, yes you are
Do do do do do do do do do do do


He looks up from second base, dad's up in the stands
He saw the hit, the run, the slide, there ain't no bigger fan
In the parking lot after the game
He said, "Dad, I thought you had a plane to catch?"
He smiled and said, "Yeah, son, I did"


But life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about
You just might miss the point trying to win the race
Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away


Fast forward fifteen years and a thousand miles away
Boy's built a life, he's got a wife and a baby due today
He hears a voice saying, "I made it son"
Says, "I told you dad, you didn't have to come"
He smiles and says, "Yeah, I know you did"




Just like it took my breath when she was born
Just like it took my breath away when dad took his last that morn


Life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about
Just might miss the point if you don't slow down the pace
Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away


Finally got over that song of ours
Stopped chasin' little red sports cars
To check the license plates
And back wood drivin' by your place
Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts
Honky Tonks, restaurants
And seein' some of our old friends
It feels good to dance again
And I can finally smell your perfume
And not look around the room for you
And I can walk right by your picture in a frame
And not feel a thing, but when I hear your name


I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
And nothing's change and we're still the same
And I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss
And I'm hanging onto every word running off of your lips
And that's all it takes and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name


Got someone special in my life
Everyone thinks she'd make a great wife
Dad says he thinks she's the one
Reminds him of Mom when she was young
But it's way too soon to be talking 'bout rings
Don't wanna rush into anything
She's getting over someone too
Dinda like me and you
And she talks about him every once in a while
And I just nod my head an' smile
'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through
Yeah, I've been there too
And when the conversation turns to you


I get caught in a "you were the only one for me"
Kinda thought, and your face is all that I see
I know I can't go back when I still go back
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And that's all it takes, and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name


So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid
(Every time I hear your name)
Stop tryin' to change the things I can't change
(Every time I hear your name)
In my heart, I know you're gone, but in my head


I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
That's all it takes and I'm in that place
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And I can't explain, but I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name


Every time I hear your name
(Every time I hear your name)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Every time I hear your name)
Ah ah, every time I hear your name


You're a crack of dawn, Monday morning, coffee strong
Poured everything you got into a paycheck Friday night
You're a Powerstroke diesel, backhoe riding king of beers, 18-wheeler driving, living life in between the lines
Of clocking in and quitting time


But then the six string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd


When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on


You're a little shy thing with a wild side
On a night like this, you just can't hide
'Cause it's time to live it up
So come on and raise your cup


If we're talking 'bout memories, yeah, we're gonna make 'em
Talking 'bout rules, you know we're gonna break 'em


When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on


Yeah, we all the same 'cause we thinking the same thing
(Yeah, we all the same 'cause we thinking the same thing)
We on the same page 'cause we sipping the same drink
(We on the same page 'cause we sipping the same drink)
Here's a little something to thank y'all for showing up
Aldean and the boys about to blow it up, haha


When the lights come on, and everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on
Your boy's blowing it up
It's going all night long
When the lights come on

Eve said to Adam honey how bout a bite
He said baby sounds tempting but you know it ain't right, but
Eve was wearing one of those low-cut leaves, so
They shook that apple right off of that tree

(na na na na na na)

Ever since then it's been a battle of the sexes
In a game called love it's wife vs. ex's
Sometimes they let us when so we feel like we beat them but
Admit it fellas, they can go undefeated

'Cause it's a woman's world
Might as well face it
Yeah they got what we want and we're willing to chase it
Yeah it's a woman's world, boys like it or not
Men buy the drinks, girls call the shots

Us boys think we're smarter, i know that's a shocker
But once they start looking like the combination to their locker
All they gotta do is flash a schoolgirl look
Next thing you know, we're carrying their books

(na na na na na na)

Once they get a little older it's just more of the same
Just costs a little extra if you wanna stay in the game
But don't think for one minute boys that we're in control
They know we can't live without 'em, that's their ace in teh hole

'Cause it's a woman's world
Might as well face it
Yeah they got what we want and we're willing to chase it
Yeah it's a woman's world, boys like it or not
Men buy the drinks, girls call the shots

Yeah!

'Cause it's a woman's world
Might as well face it
Yeah they got what we want and we're willing to chase it
Yeah it's a woman's world, boys like it or not
Men buy the drinks, girls call the shots

Yeah it's a woman's world (na na na na na na)
Yeah it's a woman's world (na na na na na na)
Yeah it's a woman's world (na na na na na na)
Men buy the drinks, girls call the shots

Yeah it's a woman's world (na na na na na na)
Yeah it's a woman's world (na na na na na na)
Yeah it's a woman's world (na na na na na na)
Men buy the drinks, girls call the shots


Oh ohohoh
Oh ohohoh


I was dreaming of war; you saw that I wouldn't die
Was dreaming of shores that my ship would find
I was dreaming because it made me feel so alive
Was dreaming it all from my bed last night


You will be my only one
Hold my hand so we can run
You and I, we're staying young, yeah
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever


This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever


I was feeling a storm, but it wasn't outside
Was feeling a force; I'm electrified
I was feeling my heart; there was thunder inside
Was feeling it all from my bed last night


You will be my only one
Hold my hand so we can run
You and I, we're staying young, yeah
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever


This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever


All the things that I don't know
All the dreams that I've been shown
All the ways that it could end tonight
Close your eyes
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever


This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever


I woke up this morning and I swore to God
I'd never, ever take another drink again
I fought it like the devil, but you know that you're in trouble
When you're fourteen and drunk by 10 am
Tried to hide it from my mom and dad, all my friends said "Straighten up"
I just laughed, said, "You don't understand
That's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man"


At sixteen I was on my own and flying high and staying stoned
I knew everything there was to know
I did things that I can't talk about
I wore my mom and daddy out
Late nights they spent praying for my soul
Stayed sober once for nine days in a row
I quit cold turkey and damn near almost made it to ten
But that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man


I look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
I'd like to pour it out, I just don't think I can
Cause that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man


I don't know when or where it was or how we met and fell in love
Or why she'd even fall for a guy like me
I tried to pull myself together, hoping we could last forever
For a while I started to believe
Her daddy said, she's all I got
Son, don't ever break her heart
Promise me before you take her hand
But that's just too much to ask of a drinking man


I look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
I'd like to pour it out, I just don't think I can
Cause that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man


I woke up this morning and I swore to God
I'd never, ever take another drink again


She wore a pink 'Bama do-rag
Smacking on Juicy Fruit
Red clay sticking
To her Timberland boots
A tight white t-shirt
Showing off her Talledega tan
I said darling where you from
She said, watch your tongue
Do you really have to ask
I'm from Ala-Freakin-Bama
Ala-Freakin-Bama
Tell me what's it to you
Ala-Freakin-Bama
'Bama
I said slow down sister
Don't mean to make you mad
I grew up on Skynyrd
And I'm a Bear Bryant fan
I can roll with the flow
Baby, you can roll with the tide
I don't mind if you do
I think it's kind of cute
The way you say it with pride
When you say


Ala-Freakin-Bama (Ala-Freakin-Bama)
Ala-Freakin-Bama (Ala-Freakin-Bama)
From her boots to her bandana
She screams Ala-Freakin-Bama
'Bama


I can roll with the flow
Baby, you can roll with the tide
I don't mind if you do
I actually think it's kind of cute
The way you say it with pride
Say it for me baby


Ala-Freakin-Bama (Ala-Freakin-Bama)
Ala-Freakin-Bama (Ala-Freakin-Bama)
Baby, open of a can of Ala-Freakin-Bama
Ala-Freakin-Bama
'Bama




I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I was not coming back
Said I'd enough
Saw you in the rear view standing
Fading from my life
But I wasn't turning round
No, not this time


But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it


When we make choices we got to live with them
Heard you found a real good man, and you married him
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind
Where would we be today?
If I never drove that car away


But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't think about it


But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it


No no
Don't think I don't
Don't think I don't
Mmm


I could spray-paint "I love you" on that bridge or in the sky
And I could swear when you say it to me, there's a good chance I could fly
And I might, it seems like, yeah
If it's gonna be any night, it might as well be tonight


There's this thing that you do, you don't know that it does something to me, yeah
It's in the way that you sway, that you talk, that you touch, that you kiss, that you breathe
That I need, you look at me, girl
You're shaking things up like you wouldn't believe
Crashing my comfort zone, setting me free
It's a "who'da thought?", "never dream" kinda thing


Your name, your name sounds so good next to mine, just saying
And I think, I think I'm gonna put it in all my rhymes, baby
'Cause with you, I'm gonna do quite a few things that I never thought I would do
Your name, your name, your name
Would be a good tattoo, yeah
Would be a good tattoo


Ink it in on my skin, sign me up, make it last against the time
'Cause this is more than a picture that fades of a first date Friday night
It's unerasable, unmistakable, hey, everybody wants to know
Now I think I know, I'll wear it on my sleeve, I gotta let it show
Making it permanent 'cause I never wanna let you go


Your name, your name sounds so good next to mine, just saying
And I think, I think I'm gonna put it in all my rhymes, baby
'Cause with you, I'm gonna do quite a few things that I never thought I would do
Your name, your name, your name
Would be a good tattoo, yeah-h-h-h-h


All my life, all I got is this one heart to give
All my life, all this time, I've been searching for this
Oh, and it looks like I found it
Yeah, I finally found it, girl
It's you-oo-oo-oo


Your name, your name sounds so good next to mine
And I think, I think I'm gonna put it in all my rhymes, yeah
'Cause with you, I'm gonna do quite a few things that I never thought I would do
Your name, your name, your name
Would be a good tattoo, yeah
Would be a good tattoo


Only you, baby
Only you, no
Only you, now

You use to sooth me
You use to swear with
Heart crossed conviction
That you'd be there
Where are you now?

Well I'm good, one of a kind
But I would rather be two
And I still speak my mind
But I miss talking with you
And I could hem and haw
But I'll just cut right through
I don't need nothing, baby
Nothing but you

Well I lit a candle
It's burning still
Most every night on
My window sill
Where are you now?

Well I'm good, one of a kind
But I would rather be two
And I still speak my mind
But I miss talking with you
And I could hem and haw
But I'll just cut right through
I don't need nothing, baby
Nothing but you

Weren't we something back then?
Thick as thieves
Who would've ever thought that you and me
Would let forever come to use to be

Well I'm good, one of a kind
But I would rather be two
And I still speak my mind
But I miss talking with you
And I could hem and haw
But I'll just cut right through
I don't need nothing, baby
Nothing but you


Just a single mom raising up the kids
Little Tommy's seven now and
Her daughter Justine just turned ten


Pinching every cent, laughing and loving and content
You would never think a couple years ago
She almost let her job, her kids, her mind, her life go up in smoke
Right there on the edge right before the fall


Somebody said a prayer, somebody had some faith
Somebody finally hit their knees and asked for help for heaven's sake
Somebody finally found someone who really cares
Somebody said a prayer


He was seventeen and his heart was broke
The middle of the night, a bottle full of pills and a goodbye note
Sitting on his bed but then he bowed his head
Now I see him every week and every now and then
He talks about that night and the peace that came over him

Talk about a sign, can I get an amen?
Well there were tears on his face
He said look what happened lord




Can I get an amen? Oh
Can I get an amen? Oh
Somebody, somebody said a prayer
Somebody said a prayer
Somebody, somebody said a prayer

I am a soldier
Trained and conditioned
Served my time
But I didn't choose this mission
Fighting a war
I think I'm the only
Solider for the lonely

I have been wounded
Under fire
But it's not deterred
Or weakened my desire
To defend them
'Cause I'm the only
Solider for the lonely

For every heart that's been broken
For every kind word left unspoken
Every promise not remembered
I'll not forget
I'll not surrender
'Cause I'm the only
Soldier for the lonely

Here in the trenches
No sanctuary
Nights are long
And solitary
Nobody holds me
'Cause I'm the only
Soldier for the lonely

For every heart that's been broken
For every kind word left unspoken
Every promise not remembered
I'll not forget
I'll not surrender
'Cause I'm the only
Soldier for the lonely

For every heart that's been broken
For every kind word left unspoken
Every promise not remembered
I'll not forget
I'll not surrender
'Cause I'm the only
Soldier for the lonely

I'll plant a rose
I'll shed a tear
I'll die alone
No one to hear
My battle cry
'Cause I'm the only
Soldier for the lonely
I'm the only
Soldier for the lonely


She says, "Baby what's that scar from?"
I said, "Girl, you don't wanna know."
She said, "What about this one or that one?"
"Girl, that was a long time ago."
She kisses and traces every one with her hands
The look on her face says she understands


My baby don't try to change me
'Cause she knows
This is the way that God made me
She gets every flaw, my rebel heart, every tattoo, every scar
She's in love with the outlaw in me


Yeah
She knows I roll with a rough crowd
And we get wild time-to-time
She knows I won't lay my guns down
I never run from a fight


My baby don't try to change me
She knows
This is the way that God made me
She gets every flaw, my rebel heart, every tattoo, every scar
She's in love with the outlaw in me

Yeah
Alright


That girl knows that she's got me
And prays one day I'll settle down
And I just thank God she loves me
Even when I don't know how


My baby don't try to change me
She knows
This is the way that God made me
She gets every flaw, my rebel heart, every tattoo, every scar
She's in love with the outlaw in me
She's in love
With the outlaw
In me

Well, I spent a lifetime lookin' for you
Singles bars and good time lovers are never true
Playin' a fool's game and hopin' to win
And tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces of what I'm dreamin' of
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discover another heart
Lookin' for love

I was alone then, no love in sight
And I did everything I could to get me through the night
Don't know where it started or where it might end
I turned to a stranger just like a friend

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces of what I'm dreamin' of
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discover another heart
Lookin' for love

You came a knockin' at my heart's door
You're everything I've been lookin' for
No more lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discover you, oh, you
Lookin' for love

She drove South I-95 straight though Carolina
She didn't use no damn map to find her way
She pulled off on a state route
Just north of Charlotte
And took mostly county roads the rest of the day

She said I'll give him an intentional heartache
That'll hurt a lot worse than the one he left in me
Would you all step back so a girl
Might could get started
Then he won't have to look twice to see

She drove up across the yard
And through his momma's garden
Didn't touch the brakes slammed
Right into his Chevrolet
Tossed out his clothes, boots
Bud cap, and signed Dale Jr. poster
Then shot the whole mess neon green
With a can of Dupont spray

She said I'll give him an intentional heartache
That'll hurt a lot worse than the one he left in me
Would you all step back so a girl
Might could get started
Then he won't have to look twice to see

She said I'll give you an intentional heartache
That'll hurt a lot worse than the one that you left in me
And tell your little tramp to step back so
Your new ex-wife can get started
Then you won't have to look twice to see

Just watch this
Then she sprayed that Bud cap bright green
Said Connie put that can of spray paint down
Just watch this
Then she pulled them Nakona boots out, sprayed them neon too
Put the can down Connie
She give it hell with that can of spray paint
He kept yelling at her just put the can down
So she sprayed him
Then she did a little dance on top of that Dale Jr. poster
Just kind of a hoochie coochie
Alright Connie
He said I saw you Connie, now put it down
Just watch this, she run over to the passenger side of that Monte Carlo
And she sprayed tramp
On the hood on the back of the house
We tried to call her sister
What was that girls name
Said you gotta come get this girl
Nancy, I think
She said watch this
Said Lookee here lookee here, watch this
She run that girl back up on the porch
Screamin' at her tramp this
Oh yeah
She give him an intentional heartache
Alright, alright Connie I heard you
His momma was crying in there on the phone
His daddy said
I told you that girl was gonna get like that
She said watch this, here

We're not strong enough to bend
We're not strong enough to say we can forgive
We're not brave enough to fall
Oh, an' we're not big enough to risk it all

Chorus:
But love is
Love is
It's always been, it always will be
We may not be perfect
But love is

We can't trust what we can't see
We're not strong enough to fight them, we feel weak
We can't resist another flame
We're not able to live above the blame

Chorus:
But love is
Love is
It's always been, it always will be
We may not be perfect
But love is

Bridge
We may not be written
Anywhere close to stars
But wherever we are
Love is

It's always been, it always will be
Life may not be perfect;
Oh, we may not be perfect
But love is
Love is
Oooh

Blowin' out spring break
With your not right friends
Wake up on the beach
With new ink on your skin

Do something crazy and dumb
While you're still young

Go on and tie the knot
Start a new life
Take turns gettin' up
When the baby cries

Living on nothin' but love
While you're still young

Life is too short
To put it off anymore
You've gotta live it before
It's too late

I can't turn that clock back around
On what you're dreamin' about
You better do it now
Don't wait

Give 'em your two-weeks
At the dead-end job
Do what you love
Be your own boss

Do what they say can't be done
While you're still young

Life is too short
To put it off anymore
You've gotta live it before
It's too late

I can't turn that clock back around
On what you're dreamin' about
You better do it now
Don't wait, don't wait

Take a gold watch
Sell everything
Throw a dart at the map
Hook up the air stream

Ride into that setting sun
Do something crazy and dumb
While you're still young
While we're still young

You're still young

Everything, everything, everything...

I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up
That girl comes without a warning
So addicting, I can’t get enough
She gets dressed for work, grabs her keys then she leaves
Yeah that goodbye kiss kills me

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I can’t help but think
There goes my everything

Everything, everything, everything...

Everytime we’re in a party
I still watch her from across the room
I ain’t notice everybody
They can’t even help but watch her too
Dressed up or dressed down
And she can’t help but shine
I can’t believe she’s mine

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I can’t help but think
There goes my everything

There goes my everything

Everything, everything, everything...

I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I can’t help but think
There goes my everything

There goes my everything


I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl


You're an angel, you're a keeper, the kinda thing that you gotta lock down
I'm lovin' just livin' every minute since you came around
I was lost in the neon lights 'til the day that you called me yours
Yeah they say when you know you know, and I know one thing's for sure


I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you, can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to Mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw so good baby, yeah


You know sometimes I dream 'bout 55 years from now
Gonna still be me you and me watchin' that sun goin' down
I'll still be stealin' your kisses, I'll still be holdin' your hand
I still look at you and I pinch myself, good Lord I'm a lucky man


I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you, can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to Mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw so good baby


I was lost in the neon lights 'til the day that you called me yours
And they say when you know you know, and I know one thing's for sure


I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you, can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to Mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw so good baby


('Cause I got myself a) good girl
(Still can't believe I) I found you
Good Lord I'm a lucky man
I could take you home to Mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw so good baby

The mechanic raised up from under my hood
He shook his head and said, "This ain't good
Your timin' belt's done, shrunk one size too small
Those spark plug wires are a little too long
And your main prodsponder's nearly gone
Your injector ports are stripped and that ain't all."

"The torque converter's runnin' low on torque
And that water pump's nearly down a quart
But we caught it all in time so you're in luck"
He said, "I've got the time and I've got the parts
Just give me the word and I'm ready to start
I think we can bring her in for eight hundred bucks."

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
Then he said, "Ain't you that songwriter guy?"
I said, "Yes, I am," he said, "So am I."

And he sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
When he finished singin' he gave me a smile
And I closed my eyes and pondered awhile
And he said, "What do you think? Now don't hold nothin' back."

Well, I gave him my most sorrowful look
And I said, "This song's got a broken hook
I can order you a new one from Nashville but it won't be cheap
And I know you've been using a cut-rate thesaurus
'Cause your adverbs have backed up into your chorus
Now your verse is runnin' on verbs that are way too weak."

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
And I said, "Hold on friend now I'm not through
I hate to be the one to give you the news

But your whole melodic structure's worked itself loose
It's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
I'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
I mean, that's just me talkin', it's really up to you."

And you've got a bad safety problem with
That dominant chord with the augmented fifth
Just see how dangerously high it raises you up
So just go on over there and work on my car
I'll sit here by the fan and chances are
I can straighten this thing out for eig...nine hundred bucks."

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long
You guessed it
It may be a hit
I like it...

I jumped in, looking to make a wave
I was working what the good Lord gave
Well baby, here I go
You'll be praying for land while I'm rocking the boat
And I'm moving, come on and join in my parade
I've been waiting for the rhythm to change
Now the time has come
So turn on the flames and turn up the sun
Like fireworks shoot into the sky
I wanna color the dark with the light
Like a diamond sitting on a ring
I'm just a girl that wants to be seen
Oh, I'm looking for a place to shine
So take ten, if I'm a little too much to take
You're gonna let a good time go to waste
So baby, get in line
'Cause it's better to play than sit on the side
And I'm thinking of busting through the door
Leaving everybody begging for more
And you know it's true
When you're a girl like me, you got nothing to lose
Like fireworks shoot into the sky
I wanna color the dark with the light
Like a diamond sitting on a ring
I'm just a girl that wants to be seen
Oh, I'm looking for a place to shine
Like fireworks shoot into the sky
I wanna color the dark with the light
Like a diamond sitting on a ring
I'm just a girl that wants to be seen
Oh, I, oh, I
I'm looking for a place to shine
Looking for a place to shine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, a place to shine
Looking for a place to shine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, a place to shine
Looking for a place to shine
Oh yeah


Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice


All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely


It's gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice


Another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh


I wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me


Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice


Another town, where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mmm, another vice


Standing at the sink, not looking at the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice


Mmm another vice
Yes, another vice
Ooh, another vice
Another vice
Another vice
Another vice

Tiny little boots covered in snow
Apple cider warmin' on the stove
Tinsel twinklin' everywhere
Holly hangin' on the stairs
It must be Christmas Eve

Angels sittin' high upon a tree
Watchin' over presents patiently
Milk and cookies on a plate
Santa Clause is on his way
The kids should be fast asleep

Sleigh bells are ringin' in their heads
Twistin' like little tops in their beds
Tryin' to sleep but it's no use
With hoofs tap tappin' on the roof
Peakin' out the window to see what they can see
It's a Candy Cane Christmas
Sweet as it can be

The kids will wake up awfully early
'Cause they can't wait to see
If Santa made it so they can say
"Look what he brought me"

Sleigh bells are ringin' in their heads
Twistin' like little tops in their beds
Tryin' to sleep but it's no use
With hoofs tap tappin' on the roof
Peakin' out the window to see what they can see
It's a Candy Cane Christmas
Sweet as it can be
It's a Candy Cane Christmas
Sweet as it can be

Oh Oh Oh Oooh, Oh Oh Oh Oooh
I work my job all the way to the weekend
Call all my buddies, ask where you been
Let's get together somewhere, seven o'clock
Wanna pop a top, pop a top, pop ugh!
Wanna go, wanna roll, wanna rock it

Hey, hey, hey, let's make some good ole days
Hey, hey, hey, let's make some good ole days
That's right
Let's make some good ole days tonight
Oh Oh Oh Oooh, Oh Oh Oh Oooh

Hey, baby, what's the chance you dancing with me?
Been watching you all night
Like what I see
That's right
That big old moon is shining down from above
You know it's stirring up magic stuff
This could be the night we fall in love

Chorus

Ice cold, wild free
Night's young for you and me
Let's do something that we'd never dare
Something we'll be talking about in our rockin chair

Hey, hey let's make some good ole days
Hey, hey let's make some good ole days


Lord I fell for her smile
And she loved me for a while
Then she said good-bye got to go
Left me standing on the side of the road
Now she's gone and I'll be a memory of her past
And the long and short of it some things never last


Oh because summers come, summers go
I'll keep walking down this road
It's alright and it's okay
I'll live to love another day
I'll live to love another day


Lord I'm out here again
With my back to the wind
The warm sun that's sinking low
Is going to leave me out in the cold
But the long and short of it some things never last
And if that goes for the good
It must go for the worse


Oh because summers come, summers go
I'll keep walking down this road
It's alright and it's okay
I'll live to love another day
I'll live to love another day


If I fall down
I'm not ashamed
I always get back up again
But I'll be fine till the right one comes to save me, save me, save me


Lord I fell for her smile
And she loved me for a while
And someday she's going to wish
She hadn't left me here like this


Oh because summers come, summers go
I'll keep walking down this road
It's alright and it's okay
I'll live to love another day
I'll live to love another day


I'll live to love another day
I'll live to love another day
I'll live to love another day


There's satellite communications
Long distance Internet relations
The world's a little faster every day
Now I know it's all well and good
And I don't embrace it like I should
But I wouldn't wanna go backwards even if I could
But


I still like bologna on white bread, now and then
And the sound of a whippoorwill down a country road
The grass between my toes and that sunset sinking low
And a good woman's love to hold me close


I like my 50 inch HD plasma
Feels like they just reach out and grab you
500 channels at my command
I finally gave in and got a cell phone
That I hardly ever seem to turn on
I guess I never had that much to say
And




I got a laptop that sits on a desk
I don't use it much except to check on
Some old car from yesterday
I kind of like that music thing
You just download them
And you can save about every song
That's ever been made
But

I still like bologna on white bread, now and then
And the sound of a shovel head down a gravel road
The grass between my toes and that sunset sinking low
And a good woman's love to hold me close



Well, I guess what I've been trying to say
This digital world is okay
It makes life better in a lot of ways
But it can't make the smell of spring
Or sunshine or lots of little things
We take for granted every day
Oh, and




Yeah, bologna, a woman's love, and a good cell phone

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
Oh what fun it is to ride
Sing ( sing ) a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Come and ride with me
In that open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
I can't think of a better way
To spend the day
Then with you by my
You right by my side
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Come and ride with me
In that open sleigh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's you, it's me
The moon, the tree
Ride through the snow
With nowhere to go
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Come outside with me
Come and ride with me
In that open sleigh
Open sleigh


Digging around
Feeling so down
Floating around like a feather
Nothing but me
And all of my dreams
Trying to hold it together
Those were long days
Long days indeed
Could not avoid
I felt no joy
No relief


Everyone knows when that's how it goes it's usually bound to get better
So when you arrived
I looked in your eyes and all I could see was forever
What a fine day
A fine day indeed
When you showed up I fell in love now look at me


I got my baby
I got those good times
Don't lack no sunshine
Baby I got you


Darling I find you're blowing my mind every time that I hold you
Better than gold the deeper we go nobody knows it like I do
These are sweet days
Sweet days indeed
A love that flows will always grow
Now can't you see




Red hot and no blues
Got no more bad news
I got my baby
Baby, I got you


And on and on
Oh what a love affair
And on and on
Oh, I will always be there
Yeah
Oh baby










I turned on the evening news
Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said "All I can say is."


Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink


I was glued to my TV and it looked like he looked at me and said
"Best start putting first things first."
Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip over and start again
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth


Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink


I've been tryna slow it down
I've been tryna take it in
In this here today gone tomorrow world we're livin' in


Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink


Now, don't blink

Baby when I look at you
You know it breaks my heart in two
How beautiful you are
I've seen you in a million dreams
Now you're finally here with me
We will never be apart
I wanna hold you forever
That's all I'll ever need

Chorus:
You are my love
You are my life
My heart and soul
The truest friend I've ever known
You are my world
All of my dreams
My fantasy, my reality
I love everything you are

Yes I do

Every time I close my eyes
It hits me so deep inside
How real this feeling is
I'm intoxicated by your touch
It's a sweet, sweet rush
I'm in love with your kiss
You're the one that I trust the most
You changed me

Chorus:
You are my love
You are my life
My heart and soul
The truest friend I've ever known
You are my world
All of my dreams
My fantasy, my reality
I love everything you are

--- Instrumental ---

Chorus:
You are my love
You are my life
My heart and soul
The truest friend I've ever known
You are my world
All of my dreams
My fantasy, my reality
I love everything you are

Everything, I love everything you are...


Find me a place in the sand
Clean these old shades off
Damn, y'all don't understand
All she wants to do is dance


She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Clouds roll by
She get me high


Don't nobody block my view
Hell you can find a spot and watch too
Watch how she makes this beach
Light up like the sky on New Year's Eve
Love it when she's locked on me


She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high


She said, "Boy, it's time to take me home"
Don't even grab your stuff
Just lay me on down
Need the pool and moonshine
You 'bout to be all mine


She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet, in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high


Clouds roll by
She get me high


Girl, I been thinking 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
These feelings piling up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me but I'll do my best


You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee


Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smiling honey right back at me
Now hold on cause I aren’t done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just having fun, but seriously


If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee


Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each other’s arms
I could have said "I love you"
Could have wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart


You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee


If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee


I'll be your honey bee


Sounds like a scene
From the silver screen
Yeah, that's how it was
Love doesn't always look
Like a picture perfect storybook
Ah, but sometimes it does
Standing beside her
The stars shined even brighter
And for a moment
All the world was still
I knew we belonged together
The moment my eyes met hers
And I thought nothing lasts forever
But maybe this one will


A deep breath and baby steps
That's how the whole thing starts
It's a long slow beautiful dance
To the beat of a heart




The world starts to spin again
You learn things you didn't know then
Feels like the bloom is off the rose
But you weather a few storms
And you pull out a few thorns
And together the garden grows and grows




It's a long, slow, beautiful dance, my friend




The house is filled with so much love
We got more than enough for two
So we've been thinking
About having a baby
I know it sounds crazy
But it seems like the natural thing to do




It's a long, slow
It's a long, slow
It's a long, slow

When the days start gettin' warmer
And the sun starts sinkin' slower
Weekends go by faster and beer starts tastin colder
Wanna tune into a station takes me on a soul vacation
Hey there mister DJ come on wont you please play
One that we can dance to
Start a big romance to
Make it pretty simple so we all can sing along
While cruisin' with the top down
Crank it up real loud
Groovy little summer song
Yeah
Make me feel the rhythm of one tropical islands
Take me to a beach somewhere everyone is smilin'
Sippin' margaritas and eyein' senoritas
I can almost see 'em swayin' once ya start playin'
One that we can dance to
Start a big romance to
Make it pretty simple so we all can sing along
While cruisin' with the top down
Crank it up real loud
Groovy little summer song
Play that guitar now come on
Play somethin sexy to make her fall in love with me
Won't you please
Play one that we can dance to
Start a big romance to
Make it pretty simple so we all can sing along
While cruisin' with the top down
Crank it up real loud
Groovy little summer song
Yeah
Play one that we can dance to
Start a big romance to
Make it pretty simple so we all can sing along
While cruisin' with the top down
Crank it up real loud
Groovy little summer song
Yeah my groovy little summer song
Feels like summer time to me
Pass me a beer


Born in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're putting your hands all over me


I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah


In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're heading out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers


'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn


Whatever feels good


Old soul, waiting my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn
So I'm alright with a slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
I'm alright with a slow burn

Throwing pictures out the window
Scattered by the way the wind blows
Bye-bye, baby, that's the last I'll see of you
Shoebox full of old love letters
I'll tear each one till I feel better
And I won't look back 'cause I don't like the view

What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings
Just give me a road and a little gasoline

We talked in circles till the words ran out
And it all came down to an angry shout
Before I knew it, I was in third gear and gone
Well, this had been coming for a long, long time
If I said, "I'm sorry," well, I'd be lying
If you think I'll never make it, well, you'd be wrong

What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings
Just give me a road and a little gasoline

What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings
Just give me a road and a little gasoline
Just give me a road and a little gasoline


I can only imagine what it will be like
When I walk by Your side
I can only imagine what my eyes will see
When Your face is before me
I can only imagine
I can only imagine


Surrounded by Your glory
What will my heart feel?
Will I dance for You, Jesus
Or in awe of You be still?
Will I stand in Your presence
Or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine
I can only imagine


I can only imagine when that day comes
And I find myself standing in the Son
I can only imagine
When all I will do is forever
Forever worship You
I can only imagine
I can only imagine


Surrounded by Your glory
What will my heart feel?
Will I dance for You, Jesus
Or in awe of You be still?
Will I stand in Your presence
Or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine

You say we need to talk like I dont know
You start speaking soft trying to break it to me slow
You say you think you need some time away from us
Baby let me beat you to the punch

It's too late it's all gone
You had your chance you took too long
Like you always do I won't wait for you
It's not a game i'ts not your choice
Must be strange to hear my voice saying
Dont come back this time
It's too late for goodbye

After all the hell you've put me through
When you start crying i didn't feel bad for you
In fact it kind of made me smile to see all those tears
It's the least that you could do for me my dear

It's too late it's all gone
You had your chance you took too long
Like you always do I won't wait for you
It's not a game i'ts not your choice
Must be strange to hear my voice saying
Dont come back this time
It's too late for goodbye

I know where I'll be somewhere you won't find me
In the arms of someone new
Who ain't a damn thing like you

It's too late it's all gone
You had your chance you took too long
Like you always do I won't wait for you
It's not a game i'ts not your choice
Must be strange to hear my voice saying
Dont come back this time
It's too late for goodbye

If heaven was an hour, it would be twilight
When the fireflies start their dancin' on the lawn
And supper's on the stove and mamma's laughin'
And everybody's workin' day is done

If heaven was a town it would be my town
Oh, on a summer day in 1985
And everything I wanted was out there waitin'
And everyone I loved was still alive

Don't cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die

If heaven was a pie it would be cherry
So cool and sweet and heavy on your tongue
And just one bite would satisfy your hunger
And there'd always be enough for everyone

If heaven was a train it sure would be a fast one
That could take this weary trav'ler 'round the bend
And if heaven was a tear it'd be my last one
And you'd be in my arms again

Don't cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die

Yeah, if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die


Yeah, yeah
Ooh it's a love thing
I been working all day long
And I'm ready to come on home to you
All the other guys roll their eyes
And don't realize it's what I want to do
It's what I want to do
They say I'm wrapped around your finger
But they don't understand
That what we got is more than just a diamond
On your hand


Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Baby it's a love thing, yeah


Sure I could hang around and complain about
The way things ought to be
Yeah there's trouble in the world
But you're the girl
Whose open arms are all I really need
And that's why I come running'
To be there by your side
To let 'em call me crazy
But it can't be denied


Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Baby it's a love thing, yeah


And it's not about the same last name
It's not a thing that can be explained
It's how you make me feel inside
And the way you hold me everynight


It's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby, it's a love thing, yeah
He we go now
It's a love thing


They say I'm wrapped around your finger
But they don't understand
That what we got is more than just a diamond
On your hand
Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah
Come on it's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby, It's a love thing, yeah
Oh, it's a love thing, whoa
Oh sugar, it's a love thing
No it ain't about no diamond ring
It's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah
It's a love, it's a love, it's a love thing


Momma looking good in some jeans all ripped
Got a baby in her belly and a baby on her hip
Little toe headed rascal peeing off the porch
Daddy got a shotgun looking for a stork
Oh lord


And that's po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
House full of youngins and a yard full of junk
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o, Po-Dunk!


Bible by the bed and a bottle sitting pretty
Pigskin on the TV, bacon in a skillet
An ol' mutt in the yard lickin' on an itch
Bunch of fake flamingos flocking by the ditch
(Can I get a witness?!)


And that's po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
A yard full of chickens and a farm full of drunks
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o, Po-Dunk!


Po-dunk


Put your adult beverage over your head
If you're bat shit crazy and your neck is red
As the dirt on the road where we all grew up
Sing something with me if you ain't nothing but...
(You ain't nothing but, you ain't nothing but, you ain't nothing but)


Po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
House full of youngins and a yard full of junk
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o, Po-Dunk!
Po-o-o-o, Po-Dunk!
Po-Dunk!
Po-Dunk!
Po-Dunk!

Come on rain
Pour on down
Flood that runway
Shut 'er down

She's in Dallas waitin' on a plain
Don't let her leave
Come one rain

Unleash your fury thorugh the sky
Let your clouds explode go on and cry
Your tears of mercy give me time
Unlock your winds and let 'em blow
Let your lightning strike, let your
Thunder roll
Heaven help me stop that plain
Come On rain

Don't let your storm clouds break
Like my heart if I'm too late
One hour is all I'm asking for
Come On Rain, Let it Pour

Unleash your fury thorugh the sky
Let your clouds explode go on and cry
Your tears of mercy give me time

Unlock your winds and let 'em blow
Let your lightning strike, let your
Thunder roll
Heaven help me stop that plain
Come On rain

And I here you come
You heard my prayer
Give it all you got, she's all I got
And I'm almost there

Unleash your fury thorugh the sky
Let your clouds explode go on and cry
Your tears of mercy give me time
Unlock your winds and let 'em blow
Let your lightning strike, let your
Thunder roll
Heaven help me stop that plain
Come On rain

Heaven help me stop that plain
Come on rain
Come on rain
Come on rain


The sunset falls in Wichita, yellow dances through the blue
Wheat fields catch a glimpse of heaven, makes me think of you
And even when you're miles away
You're always on my mind
Lord knows you're in my heart
Even when I close my eyes


You are golden
Precious as a prayer flying up through the air
While the rain is falling
Golden, timeless as a kiss
Baby I don't want to miss another perfect moment
To tell you, how you make me feel
The day you strolled in, my heart was stolen
Cause you are golden


Smallest parts of who you are
Are everything to me
From the way you laugh to the way you cry
To the way you love on me
Shadows run and darkness fades
When you come around
My single star amongst the gray
Always shining down




Lovely
Oh so hard to find
Yeah you are goodness, forgiveness
Of the purest kind
Oh yeah


From the day you strolled in, my heart was stolen
You'll be the hand I'm holding
When the heavens open
Cause you are golden, yeah


If you think I could ever go a day without you
Five minutes without thinkin' about you
Don't
And if you wonder if it scares me
Thinkin' about forever with you, baby
I can tell you, baby, it don't, oh


'Cause every single mornin'
My eyes fall open on you
It's like my dreams keep goin'
On and on and on, it don't
Matter what we're doin'
As long as I'm with you, and
I can't imagine anything
I couldn't love you through the bad days
There's gonna be mistakes
But, baby, I'm here to stay
And if you think that could change
Don't


Stop makin' me late for work
Wakin' me up without sayin' a word
Ooh, don't
'Cause when you whisper in my ear
Everything I wanna hear
I know you know, I need to go
But you're the reason that I don't


'Cause every single mornin'
My eyes fall open on you
It's like my dreams keep goin'
On and on and on, it don't
Matter what we're doin'
As long as I'm with you, and
I can't imagine anything
I couldn't love you through the bad days
There's gonna be mistakes
But, baby, I'm here to stay
And if you think that could change
Don't
Oh, baby, don't


Oh, and if you ever wonder
If I regret the day I said, "I do"
Don't


'Cause every single mornin'
My eyes fall open on you
It's like my dreams keep goin'
On and on and on, it don't
Matter what we're doin'
As long as I'm with you, and
I can't imagine anything
I couldn't love you through the bad days
There's gonna be mistakes
But, baby, I'm here to stay
And if you think that could change
Don't


Baby, don't
Don't you think I don't
Oh, yeah, I know
Baby, don't


Let’s be honest
We don’t got a lot in common when it comes down to it
You can take his breath away
And light up every room when you walk through it
But I don’t want your six-foot legs and angel face and sophistication
Don’t really want to cause a scene but girl you’ve got everything


And I want your boyfriend
I’m not gonna lie
I’ll be his girl when he tells you goodbye
Don’t worry I won’t take him cause I ain’t that low
I want your boyfriend
Just thought you should know


That he and I go back so far
Oh my gosh we lived in his first truck
First time we heard Shania Twain
Think we were on our way to Lubbock
And I know you think he loves you now
Seen so many girls come in and out
It sounds a bit insensitive but the truth is what it is


And I want your boyfriend
I’m not gonna lie
I’ll be his girl when he tells you goodbye
Don’t worry I won’t take him cause I ain’t that low
I want your boyfriend
Just thought you should know


Don’t know why you act so surprised
Can’t you see it in his eyes?
You must’ve known it all this time, yeah
But I want your boyfriend to tell you the truth
I’ll be right there when he gets over you
What’s meant to be will always find its way in the end


I want your boyfriend
I’m not gonna lie
I’ll be his girl when he tells you goodbye
Don’t worry I won’t take him cause I ain’t that low
I want your boyfriend
I want your boyfriend
I want your boyfriend
Just thought you should know


I've been watching my weight
I've been trying to do right
I've been trying to get little more sleep at night
I've been working like a dog
I've been going to church
Yeah, I've been being so damn good, it hurts


I kinda wanna lit up a couple of smokes
Kinda some Crown mixed in my coke
Kinda wanna hole up in some corner booth somewhere
I kinda wanna find a pretty little thing
That's kinda like me, don't want no strings
Knowing in the morning, it ain't going no where
But tonight, I kinda don't care


No, I don't wanna think bout nothing at all
I don't wanna sit around here all night, wishing you'd call
I kinda wanna drown your memory
Kinda wanna raise my finger to all them used to be's


Yeah, I kinda wanna lit up a couple of smokes
Kinda some Crown mixed in my coke
Kinda wanna hole up in some corner booth somewhere
I kinda wanna find a pretty little thing
That's kinda like me, don't want no strings
Knowing in the morning, it ain't going no where
But tonight, I kinda don't care


Yeah, I kinda wanna lit up a couple of smokes
Kinda some Crown mixed in my coke
Kinda wanna hole up in some corner booth somewhere
I kinda wanna find a pretty little thing
That's kinda like me, don't want no strings
Knowing in the morning, it ain't going no where
But tonight, I kinda don't care
Kinda don't care
Hell if you don't care, then I kinda don't care


Aww hell, I don't care


I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you


It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you


They got three in the front and four in the back of a Civic
Camped out all night on the sidewalk just to get tickets
With their hands on the fence in the back by the buses and the limousines
Just to get a glimpse of a drummer or singer, yeah, anything


And they come from miles around
For that moment when the lights go out
And they scream


It's the girls in the front row singing
It's the boys with the wheels that bring them
It's lighters in the air and you guys up there
You're the heart and soul and the reason we do what we do
Here's to you


There's a silver-tongued blonde trying to sweet talk her way back stage
There's a mom and a dad in the aisle not acting their age
There a wet Corvette red lipstick print on a Coors Light cup
And judging by the way she's dancing I'd say she's had enough


The guitars come alive
And you make us want to stay all night
And they scream


It's the girls in the front row singing
It's the boys with the wheels that bring them
It's lighters in the air and you guys up there
You're the heart and soul and the reason we do what we do
Here's to you, here's to you
Oh, yeah, oh, come on


It's the girls in the front row singing
It's the boys with the wheels that bring them
It's lighters in the air and you guys up there
You're the heart and soul and the reason we do what we do
Here's to you (it's the girls in the front row singing)
Yeah, here's to you, yeah (it's the boys with the wheels that bring them)
Here's to you (there's a silver-tongued blonde trying to sweet talk her way)
Yeah, here's to you, here's to you
Oh yeah, oh yeah


There's a girl somewhere in Tupelo
Who's with a guy she barely knows
Who will probably sell his soul for a kiss
There's a girl somewhere in Arkansas
Who's talking with a southern drawl
And a guy who can't stop staring at her lips


And ain't it crazy
How they make us all so crazy?


Why would we drive 600 miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made?
Get tattoos and wash our trucks?
Push and press our luck?
Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands and change our plans?
Lose our minds, break our hearts?
And learn to play guitar?
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
Cause there's a girl
Cause there's a girl


There's a girl somewhere with eyes so blue
You know a call it just won't do
So here I am on Highway 45
First girl to get me to ask myself
How I'd been with anyone else any other minute of my life?


Ain't it something
How they get us doing something?


Why would we drive 600 miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made?
Get tattoos and wash our trucks?
Push and press our luck?
Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands and change our plans?
Lose our minds, break our hearts?
And learn to play guitar?
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
Cause there's a girl
Cause there's a girl


Ain't it crazy
How they get us going crazy?


Why would we drive 600 miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made?
Get tattoos and wash our trucks?
Push and press our luck?
Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands and change our plans?
Lose our minds, break our hearts?
Learn to play guitar?
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
Cause there's a girl
Cause there's a girl

She likes to go hunting with her buddies
She once killed a dear with just a stick
She likes those smoky bars and rock gut whiskey
And pull my fingers still her favorite trick

She likes Hormel chilly on her ice cream yeah
With a jalapeño pepper on the side
She once fried bacon with her shirt off
Chopped up an onion and didn't even cry

CHORUS
Hey shes more of a man then I'll ever be
Shes done things that most men can't believe
She chews tobacco swallows the juice
Her real names shela but they call her moose
Shes more of a man then I'll ever be
It's plaine to see
She put the he in she
Shes more of a man then I'll ever be

She likes her old job down at the factory
Even though she lost an arm in 83
She spent a little time in fulsome prison
And Johnny Cash is tattooed on her knee

Shes never rode a bull that's ever throne her
Hell she rode one all the way through tennasee
Shes never met a man whose ever owned her
Although I think shes got the hots for me

Shes more of a man then I'll ever be
Shes done things most men won't believe
She eats beef jerkey by the ton
And stares directly at the sun
Shes more of a man then I'll ever be
It's plaine to see
She put the he in she
Shes more of a man then I'll ever be


(Whoa oh oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh oh)


She's got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car
Listening to The Beatles singing "Back in the USSR"
Yeah, she's going around the world tonight
But she ain't leaving here
She's just going to meet her boyfriend
Down at the street fair


And it's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight (whoa oh oh oh)
Just another American Saturday night


There's a big toga party tonight down at Delta Chi
They got Canadian bacon on their pizza pie
They got a cooler full of cold Coronas and Amstel Light
It's like we're all living in a big old cup
Just fire up the blender, mix it all up


It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Margaritas in the moonlight (whoa oh oh oh)
Just another American Saturday night


You know everywhere has something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
My great-great-great-granddaddy stepped off of that ship
I bet he never ever dreamed we'd have all this


You know everywhere has something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
Little Italy and Chinatown sitting there side by side
Live from New York
(It's Saturday Night!)


It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight (whoa oh oh oh)
Just another American, I'm just another American
And it's just another American Saturday night

Well I've got scars from what you've done
I'll show em to ya baby one by one
I took my chances, I wanted more
I found rust and I found thorns, you're like

Barbed wire, barbed wire and roses
Cut me so deep you don't even know
Every time I take a step closer
I wind up tangled, it's all over
Ain't worth the pain of tryin' to hold ya
You're like, barbed wire, barbed wire and roses

You were shiny as gold and sweeter than honey
It looked to me like you were right on the money
I scratched the surface, I found the truth
You're made for hurtin'
That's whata you do, you're like

Barbed wire, barbed wire and roses
Cut me so deep you don't even know
Every time I take a step closer
I wind up tangled, it's all over
Ain't worth the pain of tryin' to hold ya
You're like, barbed wire, barbed wire and roses

Oh and I've got scars from what you've done
And I'll show em to ya baby one by one
I took my chances, I wanted more
I found rust and I found thorns, you're like

Barbed wire, barbed wire and roses
Cut me so deep you don't even know
Every time I take a step closer
I wind up tangled, it's all over
Ain't worth the pain of tryin' to hold ya
You're like, barbed wire, barbed wire and roses
Ain't worth the pain of tryin' to hold ya
You're like, barbed wire, barbed wire and roses

No you ain't worth the pain of tryin' to hold ya
You're like, barbed wire, barbed wire and roses

She likes it in the morning
When I run my fingers through her hair
She smiles when I call her darlin
She looks like an angel layin there
She wants me in the evening
To listen close to how she feels
She needs to know I need her
And heaven knows I always will

Cuz she loves me
Every single day and night
And she says we are everything
Thats good in her life
She says she loves me more than anything
On earth and thats almost
As much as I love her

She likes to lay down on me
And rest her head on my chest
And softly whisper to me

What she won't share with anyone else
And theres a sweetness in her laughter
When it's just the two of us
And I try so hard to capture
Every little thing she does

Cuz she loves me
Every single day and night
And she says we are everything
Thats good in her life
She says she loves me
More than anything on earth
And thats almost as much as i love her

And she says she loves me
More than anything on earth
And thats almost almost as much
As I love her

And she likes it in the morning

Right now gonna take you in my arms
Hold you closer and tighter than I ever have
I'm gonna say all the things that I thought could wait
Now I realize that later could be a little too late

Baby let's love like there's no tommorrow
Live for every moment
Laugh atleast alittle everyday
If we see the sun rise in the morning
Is impossible to say
So let's love like there's no tommorrow
Today

From now on on every time we kiss
It's gonna mean
So much more when I touch your lips

When i give myself to you
Baby I won't hold nothin' back
Cause there's nothin' I wouldn't give
To make every minute last

Baby let's love like there's no tommorrow
Live for every moment
Laugh atleast alittle everyday
If we see the sun rise in the morning
Is impossible to say
So let's love like there's no tommorrow
Today


It was in a crystal bottle on his desk
He'd save it for the times to not forget
I missed the way he'd share with me
The things that he held true
While the lessons rolled around his 80 proof
All it took was...


One sip and it blew my mind
Those good ol' boys sure make it right
Knowing smooth whiskey takes some time
Ain't nothing like the real thing
And you can't go back once you get a taste
Everything is second rate
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing


Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby


I thought I'd been in love a time or two
Didn't know that I was lost till I met you
And I could tell that every other girl was history
Never knew how real could feel till you found me
All it took was...


One kiss, and you blew my mind
An All-American kind of fine
You a know a, good woman is hard to find
Ain't nothing like the real thing
And you can't go back once you get a taste
Everyone is second rate
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing


The real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing...


You know a, great song is hard to find
The right words and the perfect rhyme
'Cause we, all feel the same inside
We're all looking for the real thing


You know you're not the same once you hear it play
There's nothing else that can replace
What's genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing




Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby


A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
Before you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
It's all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up filling their paper plates
They've driven or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love


There is nothing not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love


Well, I recall a young man who was drifting aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little cafe right off of fourteenth avenue
With a whole lot to help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love




You know, to me it's all so clear
Every one of us is here
All because two people fell in love


A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon


Sometimes I wish you just...
Well, if I told you what I'm really thinkin', it might make you blush
Yeah, but baby, so what?
And I don't wanna rush
We've been pretending we're just friends and all that stuff
For long enough, yeah


I'm thinkin’ babe tonight
We start blurrin' up the lines


Go 'head, get out of your head
Think you're overthinking, use your lips instead
Cause what you want I want, I think it's easy to see, yeah
I know you're a little bit shy
But if I'm gonna be honest, baby, so am I
You're on the sidelines wasting time when you could be winning with me
All them days are over, all them red lights are green
So move on, move on, move on
Make your move on me


I can't count on twenty hands
The nights I spent up wondering what it'd be like if you was my man
No, baby I can't
No, I can't help myself
Your touch is hypnotic, I want it
It ain't nothing like I've felt
From no one else, yeah


So I'm thinkin’ babe tonight
We start blurrin' up the lines


Go 'head, get out of your head
Think you're overthinking, use your lips instead
Cause what you want I want, I think it's easy to see, yeah
I know you're a little bit shy
But if I'm gonna be honest, baby, so am I
You're on the sidelines wasting time when you could be winning with me
All them days are over, all them red lights are green
So move on, move on, move on
Make your move on me


If it ain't real love, I don't wanna pretend
Cause I got plenty of 'em, I don’t need another friend
So, start comin' up with some trouble to get in tonight, so


Go 'head, get out of your head
Think you're overthinking, use your lips instead
Cause what you want I want, I think it's easy to see, yeah
I know you're a little bit shy
But if I'm gonna be honest, baby, so am I
You're on the sidelines wasting time when you could be winning with me
All them days are over, all them red lights are green
So move on, move on, move on
Make your move on me


Staring out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder
'Bout life and love and lack of
And this emptiness in my heart
Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should try to grow up
But who knows where to start


So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away


Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen them both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just trying to search my soul
From the answers and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know
Which way to go


So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away


Maybe I'll settle down, get married
Or stay single and stay free
Which road I travel
Is still a mystery to me


So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away


Down in Mexico


You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man


Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know


Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just want to feel okay again


I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know


Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean


But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever going to be is mean, yeah


Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever going to be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


She's got a bumper like a billboard
Covered in stickers of her favorite band
She's got a handful of records that she turns to
When she needs to land
She's a Saturday night parade through the streets
That all eyes come to see including me
She carries memories around like souvenirs down in her pockets
She should have let some go by now but can't seem to drop it
Says forgiveness ain't nothing but a lifeless tire on the shoulder of her soul
That never rolls


For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than Heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Just like Guinevere


She don't hold onto nothin' new for very long
Yeah she writes you in as just one more tale
And then you're gone
Cause she once fell hard cause she dropped her guard
And no one gets to stay it's just too late


For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than Heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Just like Guinevere


For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here


For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than Heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Just like Guinevere


Lean into me Guinevere
Be mine tonight Guinevere


We all want what we ain't got
Our favorite doors are always locked
On a higher hill with a taller top
We all want what we ain't got
We ain't happy where we are
There's greener grass in the neighbors yard
A bigger house and a faster car
We ain't happy where we are


All I want is what I had
I'll trade it all just to get her back
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not
We all want what we ain't got


We all wish it didn't hurt
When you try your best and it doesn't work
And goodbye's such a painful word
We all wish it didn't hurt


All I want is what I had
I'll trade it all just to get her back
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not
We all want what we ain't got


All I want is what I had
I'll trade it all just to get her back
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not
We all want what we ain't got


I wanted the world until my whole world stopped
You know a love like that ain't easily forgot
I guess we all want what we ain't got
Yeah, we all want what we ain't got


In my home town
For anyone who sticks around
You are either lost or you are found
There is not much in between
In my home town
Everything is still black and white
It is a long, long way from wrong to right
From Sunday morning to Saturday night


Everybody just wants to get high
Sit and watch a perfect world go by
We are all looking for love and meaning in our lives
We follow the roads that lead us
To drugs or Jesus


My whole life
I have tried to run, I have tried to hide
From the stained glass windows in my mind
Refusing to let God's light shine
Down on me
Down on me


Everybody just wants to get high
Sit and watch a perfect world go by
We are all looking for love and meaning in our lives
We follow the roads that lead us
To drugs or Jesus


Everybody wants acceptance
We all just want some proof
Everyone is just looking for the truth


Everybody just wants to get high
Sit and watch a perfect world go by
We are all looking for love and meaning in our lives
We follow the roads that lead us
To drugs or Jesus


I pulled into the shopping centre
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions running down her face
All morning I would been thinking my life is so hard
And they wore everything they own, living in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away


But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry


Keep having this dream about my old man
I am 10 years old, and he is holding my hand
We are talking on the front porch watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he could not be around
So many things I want to say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind


And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry


I am sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it is up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
"I haven't had my story yet"

And everything weighing on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says
"I love you dad"


And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry


He said: "Just think it over, and write me a list
"So we can figure out what we both deserve."
She hardly could believe it, that their love had come to this:
Dividing an' deciding his and hers
But she grabbed a paper napkin, an' asked the waitress for a pen
An' one by one, she wrote down what she wanted most from him


"Honesty, sincerity, tenderness and trust
"A little less time for the rest of the world
"And more for the two of us
"Kisses each mornin', 'I love you's' at night
"Just like it used to be
"The way life was when you were in love with me."


She reached across the table an' placed it in his hand
An' said: "You know this isn't easy for me."
As he thought about the new car, the house an' the land
An' wondered what that bottom line would be
An' a thousand other things that she'd want him to leave behind
But he never dreamed he'd open up that napkin and find:




Well, he fought back the tears, as he looked in her eyes
An' said: "I don't know where to start."
An' she said: "Everything on that list in your hand
"Is hidden somewhere in your heart
"Honesty, sincerity, just like it used to be
"The way life was when you were in love with me."


Front of the line, straight past the bouncer
Looking so fine that the band announced ya
Gotcha tight jeans on and your hair done right
All your girlfriends say we throwing down tonight

I bet he's sitting at home all alone in the dark
Probably texting like mad, wants to know where you are
Cause he didn't even know what he had 'til he lost it
Should have known running around was gonna cost him
No way that girl is as pretty as you
I never even seen her but I know that it's true
If he was even half a man he wouldn't have blown it
Thinking about it that way feels good don't it


Baby I could be your payback
Hey, gonna help you get your sway back
Take ya to the dance floor, I'ma lean ya way back

Gonna have a real good time

Sometimes it feels like
This world's spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
So naturally, we have
More natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was a day of rest
Now, it's one
More day for progress
And we can't slow down
Cause more is less
It's all an endless process


I miss Mayberry
Sitting on the porch
Drinking ice cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
Pickin' on the six string
People pass by and you
Call them by their first name
Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye, (bye)


Sometimes I can hear
This old earth shoutin'
Through the trees
As the wind blows
That's when I climb up
Here on this mountain
To look through God's window
Now I can't fly
But I got two feet
That get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear




Sometimes I dream I'm driving
Down an old dirt road
Not even listed on a map
I pass a dad and son
Carrying a fishing pole
But I always wake up every time
I try to turn back

I toss and turn, I'm losin' sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wanderin' around in circles, in a daze


Just when I start awakening
I find that somethin's intoxicatin' me
'Til I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze


I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is
Relentless


Just like the waves against the sand
Over and over and time and time again
Your love keeps on reachin' out to me


I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is
Relentless


I can't fight it
There's no hidin'
Girl, your love is
Relentless


I'm starin' at a hurricane
A hundred miles of drivin' rain
I just smile and lean into the wind
'Cause I can't outrun it




I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is
Relentless


I can't fight it
There's no hidin'
Girl, your love is
Relentless


I toss and turn, I'm losin' sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wanderin' around in circles, in a daze


Just when I start awakening
I find that somethin's intoxicatin' me
'Til I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze


It feels like I woke up one morning
And it all changed without warning
I don't know how our paths crossed
But all I know is I've been lost
Now it's hard to think
That we were ever strangers


Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes I'm in love with the girl


I talk about being caught off guard
Talk about an old boy falling hard
Think about a few weeks flying by
And talk about losing track of time
Now I'm counting every second until I see her


Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes I'm in love with the girl


I was cool with hanging around
Now I got plans bigger than this town
Saying things I aren’t never said
And being with her ever chance I get
Heard the old man say son when you know
Hold on tight and don't let go
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes I'm in love with the girl

Tuesday night crowded bar
Some guy lights a cheap cigar
Bartender yells at him
So he walks out and you walk in
Right through then cloud of smoke
Catcalls and dirty jokes
Scan the room a couple times
Find a seat right next to mine


Lonely eyes
Well, it sure looks like
You just might
Be looking for something
For something, whoa
Look at me
And I think You'll see
Those Lonely Eyes
Don't have to be alone tonight

They analyze your glass of wine
Roll away a pickup line
Now and then they check your phone
Catch mine and let 'em go
From the little bit I've seen
They're the perfect shade of green
Next time they come my way
Heaven help me make 'em stay


Lonely eyes
Well, it sure looks like
You just might
Be looking for something
For something, whoa
Look at me
And I think You'll see
Those Lonely Eyes
Don't have to be alone tonight

Don't make me pay my tab
Catch a cab
Go home and kick myself to sleep tonight
Gimme a sign
Just a smile
Baby, I'll be glad to lose myself deep inside

Lonely eyes
Lonely eyes
Sure looks like
You just might
Be Looking for something
For something, whoa
Look at me
And I'll think you'll see
Those lonely eyes
They don't have to be alone tonight
Lonely Eyes, you don't have to be alone tonight

I know you're holding your breath
You're wondering what's coming next
Can't be too careful this time
No Love ain't something you trust
You've seen a little too much of the quittin' kind
That pain you're wrestling with
I know right where it lives
Been there a couple of times
Always 'almost in tears'
Living in fear of the quittin' kind

If you don't know what you're got
I'll tell you one thing it's not
It's not the kind of love that would turn and run
This one's steady and strong
This one will keep going on and on and on
To the end of time
It ain't the quittin kind

You don't have to be scared
We're not going back there
We're going to leave it behind
All that sorrow and grief those bad memories of the quittin' kind

If you don't know what you're got
I'll tell you one thing it's not
It's not the kind of love that would turn and run
This one's steady and strong
This one will keep going on and on and on
To the end of time
It ain't the quittin kind

This one's steady and strong
This one will keep going on and on and on
To the end of time
It ain't the quittin kind
Quittin' kind no no no
It ain't the quittin kind


Don't worry, baby, sometimes things change
Nothing we can do about it now, no way
This doesn't come easy, but that's just life
We can't keep pretending everything's alright
We told each other it was love before
The simple truth is it just ain't no more
The bells stop ringing, the music won't play
The crazy little feeling that's faded away
Like snowflakes when the weather warms up
Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
All the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
Like a red kite lost in a blue sky wind
I don't know where the good times end when


It ain't nothing we ever said or ever did wrong
It's just love done gone


I don't regret a single thing that we did
Anytime together, we ever spent
I wouldn't change a thing, baby, you know
Sometimes we got to just go with the flow
Like snowflakes when the weather warms up
Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
All the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
Like money in a slot machine
Don't know what happened to you and me


It ain't nothing we ever said or ever did wrong
It's just love done gone

My mama got married to someone I barely knew
They had me and then they had my sister too
I was too young to understand why he left
But how it broke Mama's heart, I'll never forget
It was three years before she met somebody new
And though I didn't have much to compare him to

He was the best man, my mama ever loved
Not the kind that walks away, but the kind that don't give up
Devoted and true, someone to look up to
Even a boy of eight could understand
He was the best man

He called me his son and I called him my dad
He was the like no friend I had ever had
He taught me how to drive a nail and how to build a go-cart
And how to love a women with all of my heart
One night we watched him get down on one knee
And ask mama to be his wife, then he asked me

To be the best man, and I stood by his side
As he lifted the veil of that beautiful bride
He said I do, then she did too
And she walked back down the aisle holding hands
With the best man

He said I do, and then she did too
And she walked back down the aisle holding hands
With the best man


It's summer nights baby!
Come on ladies, it's time to pop that top
And fellas, I know you're ready to rock
We went crazy, cooped up all winter long
And school is out so let's get it on
Flip flop tan and some white sand
I know the perfect spot
Well the sunset better set soon so we can get in the mood
Things start gettin' all heated up when it starts gettin' cool
Yeah


Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights
Come on -- Oh, yeah, yeah


Now fellas, you better watch your step
Don't let them teeny French bikinis make you lose your breath
Back to the ladies - y'all keep doing y'alls thing
Cause everything about you makes me wanna scream
The sun is getting low, there it goes
Here we go, here comes the moon
Things start getting all heated up
When it starts getting cool, yeah


Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights


Oh, it's a party down in Padre
Big bonfire on the beach
It's Coronas in Daytona, y'all
Well, it's wild and it's free


Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights
Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights


Yeah, yeah are you ready
For some summer nights
Yeah, baby
Summer nights
It's summer nights
Come on


Sweet like a kiss sharp like a razor blade
I find you when I' m close to the bottom
You can't appreciate the time it takes
To kick a love I always knew was kind of wrong
And as I'm putting out the flame
Somebody brings up you name


Oh oh oh oh
Baby baby baby bring me down
I want to be right where you are
Baby baby baby bring me down
You can look me in the eye and break my heart
Break my heart


Six AM unruffled pillow
Laughs out loud at my trusting heart
It's like I didn't see the penny
I missed the fountain by a couple yards
If you would only stay gone
Maybe I could move on




Bring me down

Away in a manger, no crib for his bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is neigh
Believe me, Lord Jesus, I asked thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me I pray
Bless all of the dear children in thy tender care
And take us to heaven to live with thee there...

One day, I'll slow and lay down
Spend my weekends in a swing out on the wraparound
Oh but these days, I'm on a mission
To get these wild oats out of my system
Yeah, I might stay out all night
I've gotta do a little wrong so I know what's right

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Now, I might have to kiss no telling how many lips
Before I ever really figure out what love is
Go through some heartbreaks, wake up with headaches
Don't learn nothing 'til you make a lot of mistakes
How will I know where to draw the line
If I don't cross it a few hundred times?

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Yeah, I'm gonna stay out all night
I've gotta do a little wrong so I know what's right
I've gotta live a lot of life if I'm gonna give good advice
When I'm talking to my grand-babies
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Yeah, I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Young and crazy
Young, young and crazy
Young and crazy

(Billy Falcon)

Charlie drives a brand new Mercedes Benz
He's got another one just like it, just like all his friends
His wife is playing tennis and his kids are off at school
He drives home to his empty house, sits by his empty swimmin' pool

But he's got power windows
He's got power brakes
He's got a power bed; push a button and it shakes
He's got no one to talk to, tears rollin' down his face...
He ain't got the power... the power of love

Lewis drives a beat up '69 Dodge
Swears it's a statue of Mary keeps his car from fallin' apart
Gracie right beside him sittin' closer than a smile
She's got her head on his shoulder
Oh how he loves to drive and hold her

He's got no power windows
Got no power breaks
He ain't got no power nothin' but he's got what it takes
He's got Gracie's arm around him and a smile upon his face....
He's got the power...the power of love

No air conditioning no cellular telephone
He goes rumblin' down the highway, listenin' to his AM radio
One arm out the window and a smile upon his face...
Makes you wonder how he got there, 'till you see him look at Grace. (see him look at Grace)

He's got the power (ain't that the power of love)
He's got the power (ain't that the power of love)

He's got no power windows
Got no power brakes
He ain't got no power nothin' but he's got what it takes......
He's got Gracie's arm around him and a smile upon his face...
He's got the power.......of love

Power of love (ain't that the power of love)
Power of love (ain't that the power of love)
Power of love (ain't that the power of love)


In this kind of town people stay together
Nobody leaves unless they leave forever
But then again, they don't really leave
Cause deep down inside of me I know Heaven's got to be
This kind of town
In this kind of town we know how to fix it
We know how to make it, we know how to mix it
Friday night lasts all weekend long
We crank it up loud and sing a little song about
This kind of town


We work hard, play hard
Take our paychecks straight to the Walmart
Girls will out drank you
Boys will out Hank you
Tie a yellow ribbon on a tree to say thank you
Sunday morning rolls around
We walk up the aisle and kneel down
We look around at all we've been given
And we thank God to be living in
This kind of town
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)


In this kind of town there's peanuts in a bottle
The old men ramble at the brand new mcdonald's
Talk about the war and the football team
Saying lordy me I never thought i'd live to see this kind of town




No it ain't everything but let me tell you, it's everything
In this kind of town people stay together
Nobody leaves unless they leave forever
But then again, they don't really leave
Cause deep down inside of me I know Heaven's got to be
This kind of town
This kind of town
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)


Everybody told me he was a dream
Picture perfect
Like he stepped right off the silver screen
Said that he would sweep me off my feet
But I'm still standing
No, he didn't do it for me

'Cause I don't go for all that wine and dine
With the Ray Ban
Fake tan
Never mind


I want a down home
Up-with-the-sun-rise man
A pick-up truck driving
Bull riding
Strong steady hand

I want the Wrangler
Stetson
And all that stuff
I want the real McCoy
I want a Cowboy


I'm tired of talking 'bout it
Wasting my time on all the cheap talkers
Needing me
Feeding me lines

Give me somebody who's tender but tough
Simple and honest
Knows a thing or two about love

I've seen enough to know
I know what I like
It's the hard working
Head turning
Rugged type




I've seen enough to know
Ya know what I mean
Ride me off into the sunset
That's my thing



Give me the Wranglers
Stetson
All that stuff
I want the real McCoy
I want a cowboy
I want a cowboy


"Take a left here, boy, take it slow
Don't get distracted by that radio"
I just rolled my eyes and I said, "Daddy, I know
I'm fifteen, I ain't green like some ol' ten year old"


What I wouldn't give to be sixteen, wild and free
Cruisin' up and down Main in my F-150
Roll the windows down, bass too loud from this burnt CD
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm sixteen, sixteen, yeah
Sixteen


Now that I can drive, finally feel alive, but I got this curfew
Sneakin' in late, smelling like my girlfriend's perfume
People talkin' 'bout college and knowledge and that's alright
But all I'm thinkin' 'bout is an unsupervised Saturday night


What I wouldn't give to be eighteen, wild and free
Buzzin' off a can of that Grizzly wintergreen
Lookin' old enough to pull off this fake ID
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm eighteen, eighteen
Eighteen, yeah


I'm old enough to smoke, I'm old enough to vote
But they turn me away when I go to the Cotton-Eyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener, and I believe that's right
But my friends are off to Vegas, and they're leavin' me behind


What I wouldn't give to be twenty one, wild and free
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls, go see the world, let my wild streak run
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm twenty one, twenty one
Woah, when I'm twenty one
Yeah, when I'm twenty one, it'll be alright
Yeah, it'll all be alright when I'm twenty one


Now I'm twenty five, and I'm drinkin' wine with my wife at home
Got a couple dogs and a couple songs on the radio
And we sit around, and we laugh about how we used to be
When all we cared about was turning sixteen


If you're going out with someone new
I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you


Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on


You said pick me up at three a.m
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you


I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you

Like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear

I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go


I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you

If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you


Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on


You said pick me up at three a.m
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you


I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you


Somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
Somewhere with you

Four wheels churning up a fresh green pasture
Throwing mud pies everywhere
I'm beside you yellin' faster faster
Wind whippin' through my tangled hair and you know
You know
There's nothin' like it in the world
When your out there underneath the sun
And I'm a dirty girl
I like it when we get cleaned up on Sunday
Feel my skin against a string of pearls
And when we hang out it's
It's just a fun day
You know I love it when I get to be a dirty girl

Chorus: dirty girl
You'll be workin' on that El Camino
Bustin' knuckles with a monkey wrench
I'll come sneakin' up
And whisper real low
What you really need is a 3/16ths
And you know that there's nothin' like it in the world
When were underneath the hood and I'm a dirty girl

I like it when we get cleaned up on Sunday
Feel my skin against a string of pearls
Or when we hang out it's
It's just a fun day you know
I love it when I get to be a dirty girl

Chorus:dirty girl
And you know, you know that there's nothing like it in the world
It might be axle grease and Mississippi mud
But when you touch my cheek and leave a little smudge
I'LL BE YOUR DIRTY GIRL
I like it when we get cleaned up on Sunday
Feel my skin against a string pearls
Or when we hang out and it's
It's just a fun day
You know I love it when I get to be a dirty
Get to be a dirty girl

Chorus:dirty girl
I get to be a dirty girl


I was sitting in traffic for the fifth year in a row
Wasting my time just to get where I don't even wanna go
I started jotting things down on a Krispy Kreme sack
Everything I'd do if I could leave this place and never look back


I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all


I wanna drink tequila down in Tijuana
Say, "why not" when somebody says, "hey do you wanna"
I wanna get my heart broke once or twice
Settle down with the love of my life
Rock little babies to sleep at night


I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all


I wanna spend today, every now and then
Just doing what I wanna do
When I wanna do it
(I wanna do it all)
Anytime I wanna do it
(I wanna do it all)


I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all


See Niagra Falls, fight City Hall
Feel good in my skin, beating the odds with my back to the wall
Trying to rob Peter without paying Paul
I wanna do it all, I wanna do it all, I wanna do it all


It's four in the mornin', dirt road in Georgia
Blue lights in the rearview
Your blue eyes wide open
Like boy, what you tryin' to do
Think that left turn lost 'em
And it's turnin' you on
You're climbin' over the console
So I'm guessin' it's on
Alright, alright
You're lovin' this fast lane life
Don't lie, don't lie
You don't wanna say goodnight


I tried to tell ya I was crazy
Tried to tell ya that I'd lost my mind
Tried to tell ya I was nothin' but trouble, baby
Yeah, but baby, you thought I was lyin'
Now you got yourself a situation
An angel fallin' for a renegade
You can't blame me if you try and never change me
Yeah, I tried to tell ya I was crazy


Middle of the night, I'm outside in your driveway
Baby, let's go
Didn't call or nothin', just showed up
And told you it's time to roll
Gotcha head over heels
Girl, ain't this a trip
It's ride or die for real
You're lovin this bad boy sh-


I tried to tell ya I was crazy
Tried to tell ya that I'd lost my mind
Tried to tell ya I was nothin' but trouble, baby
Yeah, but baby, you thought I was lyin'
Now you got yourself a situation
An angel fallin' for a renegade
You can't blame me if you try and never save me
Yeah, I tried to tell ya I was crazy


Alright, alright
You're lovin' this fast lane life
Don't lie, don't lie
You don't wanna say goodnight
Alright, alright
And I think I want this ride
For life, for life
And I'll never say goodbye


I tried to tell ya I was crazy
Tried to tell ya I was outta my mind
Tried to tell ya I was nothin' but trouble, baby
Yeah, but baby you saved my life
Now we got ourselves a situation
An angel runnin' with a renegade
You can't blame me, she never tried to change me
Naw, knowin' damn well that I was crazy


I think me and you should blow this off
So much for the after-party
Let's tell everybody we got lost
I think me and you should do our own thing
Our own way
At my place, far away


Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me


Baby, you should stop right now, right here
Right where we wanna be
I'll spin you around and let's just see
Where this thing goes
All I know is that I'm all yours, all night
I've got nothing but time


So take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Take it from me, yeah


But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me


Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulders
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Just take it from me


Take my word, take my heart
Take my kiss and maybe take it too far
But baby take it from me
Oh, just take it from me
But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me
Oh, just take it from me


It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home


Well, I worked all week
So I could come here
Have a good time and an ice cold beer
But one turned to 10 and 10 turned to 20
And 20 plus an empty bottle's too damn many


It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home


Well it seems that I, misplaced my shirt
I can’t find my keys for all this parking lot dirt
My fall back plan, has done got sad
'Cause my ex-girlfriend aren’t looking half bad


It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home
"Help me up, aww, put me back down, put me back down"


I sucker punched my best friend
And the bouncer head locked me on stage with the band
I, I look like hell, I feel like shit
I think it’s time I call it quits


It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home


Yeah, it’s time to take my drunk ass home
I twisted up my ankle, can’t find my cell phone
Yeah, my lips all busted and my buzz is gone
It's time to take my drunk ass home
If y'all agree, then sing along
It's time to take, my drunk ass home


"Oh somebody call me a cab, please"


High beams, you and me
Little back road, barely see
Right song, radio
Throw it in low and drive slow
I saw you and it lit me up
A girl like you, it's just too much


Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights




We can feel our way through
Let me just hold on to you
Baby trust my hands
Live it up while we still can and


Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights


Don't it feel right
Until the sunrise
We can just go on what we know




Can't help but wanna want ya
You wanna do this don't ya
Come here, let me pull you closer
You reach over and


Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights


Kill the lights
Baby you and me, kill the lights
Kill the lights


I don't know how I survived
In this cold and empty world for all this time
I only know that I'm alive
Because you love me


When I recall what I've been through
There's some things that I wish I didn't do
Now I do the things I do
Because you love me


And now that you're in my life, I'm so glad I'm alive
'Cause you showed me the way
And I know now how good it can be
Because you love me


Oh, and now that you're in my life
Oh, I'm so glad I'm alive
'Cause you showed me the way
And I know now how good it can be
Because you love me


I believe in things unseen
I believe in the message of a dream
And I believe in what you are
Because you love me


With all my heart and all my soul
I'm loving you and I never will let go
And every day I'll let it show
Because you love me


Because you love me
Ooh, because you love me

He's not talkin' and she's not speakin'
And they're not budgin' and that's just that
He's just fumin' and she's just steamin'
And they're not listening to the fact
That hearts are cryin' and love is dyin'
And neither wants to understand
'Cause he's not talkin' and she's not speakin'
And they're not budgin'

But they used to stroll in the rain
Then build a fire and pull the shades
They kissed their way all through the dark
She's whisper all her deepest dreams
He'd tell her she's his everything
She'd lay her head down on his heart
They were so in love
Yeah, they were so in love

He's not talkin' and she's not speakin'
And they're not budgin' and that's just that
Hope is crumblin' and walls are tumblin'
It's all just jumpin right off the tracks
And doors are slammin' and heels are stompin'
And they're both walkin' their separate ways
And he's not talkin' and she's not speakin'
And they're not budgin'

But they used to jump in his Corvair
They're side by side without a care
Drive till the scenery was right
Lay on a blanket on the ground
And watch the clouds blow around
Just holdin' each other tight
They were so in love
Yeah, they were so in love

--- Imstrumental ---

They were so in love
Yeah, they were so in love

If he'd start talkin' and she'd start speakin'
And they'd start tryin' they'd start to see
That's it's worth keepin' and they're worth savin'
And they're not far from what they need
To start forgivin' and start relivin'
All the love they used to have
So he starts budgin' and she starts biddin'
And he stops steepin' and she starts givin'
And they start cryin', and they start hopin'
And they start talkin'

Then, they take a stroll in the rain
And build a fire, pull the shades
Kiss their way all through the dark
She whispers all her deepest dreams
He tells her she's his everything
She lays her head down on his heart
They're so in love
Yeah, they are so in love
And that's just that...

Ain't nothin' goin' on in town tonight
Except a loud party crowd drinkin' too much beer
So baby tell me would it be alright
If we just take a little rain check and stay right here
I'm sure we could find somethin' to do
As a matter of fact baby why don't you grab
A couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take if from there
Yeah I can take it from there

I'm gonna put an ol' record on, Conway Twitty
Yell girl I'd love to lay you down
Kill the ringer on the telephone
Ain't gonna stop lovin' you til the candle burns out

Oh there it is, that little smile of yours
Come on darlin' whatcha waitin' for
Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there

Tomorrows gonna be here way too soon
Let's not waste another minute girl
I got plans for me and you
Just grab a couple glasses and that bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and darlin' turn down those lights
Baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there
Oh I can take it from there


My daddy taught me in this country everyone's the same
You work hard for your dollar and you never pass the blame
When it don't go your way
Now I see all these big shots whining on my evening news
About how they're losing billions
And it's up to me and you to come running to the rescue

Well pardon me if I don't shed a tear
Cause they're selling make-believe
And we don't buy that here


Cause in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down


Well that old man's been working in that plant most all his life
Now his pension plan's been cut in half and he can't afford to die
And it's a crying shame, cause he ain't the one to blame

When I look down to see his calloused hands
Well let me tell you friend it gets me fightin' mad


Because in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down

While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
In the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
They're shuttin' Detroit down


Well I’ve been watching you girl
The way you move got the room on fire
Oh yeah rock my world
Wanna take you home with me
Well I ain’t letting you go
Home with the boy who don’t deserve you
Oh yeah baby don’t say no
I wanna take you home with me
You should never be lonely (lonely)
You’re the best that I’ve ever seen


I wanna take you back to my place
You can do your dance on the kitchen floor
I wanna hear your boots knocking down that hallway
Right on through that bedroom door
I wanna lay you down next to me (next to me)
I wanna ease your mind and maybe set you free
Can’t you see I wanna take you home with me


Oh my time does fly
2 AM and the bar is closing
Are we saying goodbye
Or are you coming home with me
You should never be lonely (lonely)
You’re the best that I’ve ever seen


I wanna take you back to my place
You can do your dance on the kitchen floor
I wanna hear your boots knocking down that hallway
Right on through that bedroom door
I wanna lay you down next to me (next to me)
I wanna ease your mind and maybe set you free
Can’t you see I wanna take you home with me


Lay your body next to me
All your troubles up and leave
Ease my mind and set me free
Come on come on
Lay your body next to me
All your troubles up and leave
Ease my mind and set me free
Come on come on


Maybe stay with me tonight
Hug and squeeze and hold me tight
Kiss your face in morning light
Come on come on


I wanna take you back to my place
You can do your dance on the kitchen floor
I wanna hear your boots knocking down that hallway
Right on through that bedroom door
I wanna lay you down next to me (next to me)
I wanna ease your mind and maybe set you free
Can’t you see I wanna take you home with me


Lay your body next to me
All your troubles up and leave
Ease my mind and set me free
Come on come on
Lay your body next to me
All your troubles up and leave
Ease my mind and set me free
Come on come on


I have days where I hate my job
This little town and the whole world too
And last Sunday when my Bengals lost
Lord, it put me in a bad mood
I have moments when I curse the rain
But then complain when the sun's too hot
I look around at what everyone has
And I forget about all I've got


But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and peice of land
A few dollars in a coffee can
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kid's dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man


Got some friends who would be here fast
I could call 'em any time of day
Got a brother who's got my back
Got a mama who I swear's a saint
Got a brand new rod and reel
Got a full week off this year
Dad had a close call last spring
It's a miracle he's still here


But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and peice of land
A few dollars in a coffee can
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kids dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man


My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And even my bad days ain't that bad
Yeah, I'm a lucky man


I'm a lucky, lucky man


Eight years old a couple cane poles sitting down by the creek
Our lines in the water watching those bobbers seeing that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling "Supper's hot, y'all come and get it!"
We yelled five more minutes
At sixteen it was twelve o three standing at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight, but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off, interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes


Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes


At eighteen, turned my helmet in, and walked to the fifty yard line
It's just the coach and me after we lost eighteen to nine
And I cried, "man next time to get in here, I'll have to buy a ticket"
Can't you give me five more minutes


Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes


At eighty-six my grandpa said there's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round we knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes


Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah sometimes this all life will leave you wishing
That you had five more minutes
Oh five more minutes


You open your heart, open your mind, let somebody in
Take a walk through your past
The good and the bad, decide you can do this again
But it's supposed to feel different
Supposed to feel safe, safe like going home
But just like sand, it slips through your hands
Before you know, it your faith is gone


Every late night call, every morning kiss
All the "I can't live without you's"
And you say goodbye like this
Don't you understand? Do you even care?
If you love me like you said you did
Well, you'd still be standing here
You think you know somebody


It's all just a blur, the nights are the worst
This bed still smells like you
Wake up from the dreams, catch my breath
It takes everything I've got to move
Yeah, it could've been a long walk talk to fix this
The seas were getting rough, but I thought we were worth it
Worth the try, worth the fight
Show you what I know, yeah


Every late night call, every morning kiss
All the "I can't live without you's"
And you say goodbye like this
Don't you understand? Do you even care?
If you love me like you said you did
Well, you'd still be standing here
You think you know somebody


Tell me, where did you go when the lights came up?
I don't even know you anymore
But holding a knife, I can see things better
Yeah, you've done this before


You think you know
Yeah, you think you know somebody
You think you know, you think you know, you think you know, you think you know
You think you know


Every late night call, every morning kiss
All the "I can't live without you's"
And you say goodbye like this
Don't you understand? Do you even care?
If you love me like you said you did
You'd still be standing here
You think you know somebody


You think you know somebody, yeah, ah, yeah
You think you know, you think you know
You think you know somebody, yeah
You think you know, you think you know
You think you know somebody
(Think you know, you think you know, think you know somebody, you think you know, you think you know, you think you know somebody)
You never know, you never know


She rose out of bed, wipes the sleep out of her eyes
I know she's bound to be tired, but she looks so satisfied
We stayed up a little late last night
I guess I must be doing something right


Cause my baby's got a smile on her face
My baby's got a smile on her face, oh yeah


As soon as I get to work I call her on the phone
I wanna tell her that I love her, I can't wait til I get home
She doesn't say a word when I walk in
Looks like we might not get much sleep again


Cause my baby's got a smile on her face
My baby's got a smile on her face


Every time we get together
My baby's got a smile on her face
Yeah, I wanna make it last forever
My baby's got a smile on her (you're gonna take it easy)


Just look at her, gotta look at her
Take a look at that smile on her face

At night when the restless wind blows
Sometimes I watch you sleep
Wondering how someone so close
Could be so far out of reach
I don't know why we're apart
But, I know here in my heart

Till we kiss, till we touch
Till we both feel the rush
Till we lie face to face
And I feel your embrace
I'll ride out this storm we're in
Until we fall back in love again

Our love is just like the moon:
Sometimes it comes and goes
An' there are phases that it goes through
That cause ebbs and flows
The reasons aren't always so clear
But, I will always be here:

Till we kiss, till we touch
Till we both feel the rush
Till we lie face to face
And I feel your embrace
I'll ride out this storm we're in
Until we fall back in love again

Instrumental break

Oh, I'll ride out this storm we're in
Until we fall back in love again

My heart has arrived
Love lives in your eyes
And I need to know
What you see in mine
I've been shattered and healed
Searching for something that's real
Where do you stand?
How do you feel?

(Chorus)
If I run will you run after me
If I walk will you wait patiently
If I fall will you have sympathy
If I run
If I run will you run after me
Yeah, yeah
I've dreamed of a place
Of white satin and lace
Black on a tie
And cake on my face
Wicker rocking chairs
Salt and peppered hair
When that day comes 'round
Will you still be there

(Repeat Chorus)
Ooh yeah
I won't baby
And if I run
Oh if I, if I, if I run

(Repeat Chorus 2x)
Oh yeah
Oh
My heart has arrived

I found a book that my mama kept
Filled with secrets she hid
And in a dusty old attic, one mornin I read
About a woman I never met
Who had dreams just like mine
With every page that I turned, the words came alive

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

A tear fell on that faded page
Cause this was somebody else
Not the mama I knew who never thought of herself
But the times, they were different then
And lines just didn't get crossed
And these words that she wrote, they somehow got lost

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

The chance that she never had
Is now the gift that is mine
And out here on this road, I'm makin up for lost time
Yeah, I am my mother's child
And tonight in this car
I've got her words in my suitcase and her dreams in my heart

As I roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
While I still have the chance
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
While I still have the chance


Missed my alarm clock ringing
Woke up, telephone screaming
Boss man singing his same old song
Rolled in late about an hour
No cup of coffee, no shower
Walk of shame with two different shoes on
Now it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all


Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Pshh it happens


My trusty-rusty had a flat
I borrowed my neighbors cadillac
"I'll be right back," going down to wally world
That yellowed light turned red too quickly
Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl
"Sorry 'bout your neck baby"
But it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all




Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Yeah, the irrefutable, indisputable, absoluteable, totally beautiful fact is...Pshh, it happens


When the lights go down
And you're stuck here in this town
With nowhere to go
So you escape through the radio

And you worked all week
To barely make ends meet
Well, I gotta a little cash burning holes in my pocket
Foot on the gas, taking off like a rocket


So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking
Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money


We can dance in the dark
Blow the speakers out of this car
Light it up, burn it down
Until the morning rolls around

In a field where we can scream
Get away with almost anything
Yeah, every now and then you gotta raise a little hell
Hope we get lucky and stay out of jail


So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking
Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money


So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking
Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money


So come on, come on
Yeah, come on, come on

You had the headlights off so no one could see
Sneaking up the driveway, I was about seventeen
Waiting there for you at the window around midnight
Smiling, arms wide open run across the lawn
That crazy dog barking like a fire alarm
I jumped in the car and said, "Boy, you better fly"
Don't you worry, I have a story to tell
Cause if we got caught, we were gonna catch hell
But I'd pay any price for that look in your eyes

When we ran like wild horses through the night
Sticking to the back roads, staying out of sight
Making the most of what little time we had left
How sweet it is, how sweet it was
Young love

Not a cloud in the sky, only the heavens and us
That old radio singing, tires kicking up dust
Oh in all my years, I don't think I've known a better night
Faded jeans laying in a field on the ground
You and me smiling, rolling round and round
In all my life, don't think I've held on quite as tight
We ran out of time with the rise of the dawn
Autumn was calling for us to move on
And now I only see you in a memory or two

When we ran like wild horses through the night
Sticking to the back roads, staying out of sight
Making the most of what little time we had left
How sweet it is, how sweet it was

Makin' the most of what little time we had left
How sweet it is, how sweet it was
Young love

Work, work, work, man that's all I ever do
Been hitting it, getting it, giving it, living them working man blues
Working on that pick-up, working on that check
Working on that twerking, man it still ain't working yet

Hey, can I get a little, "Hey man"
Anybody been where I've been
It just don't stop when you punch that clock
Gotta rock on right through the weekend
Gotta keep on keeping on, gotta keep that percolator perking
Got a wheel, got a way, got a hang, got a how
And right now I'm just working on a big buzz

Picking off them floaters from the ice tub
Sipping them suds and hanging with my buds
Speaking of buds, who's got a light?
Gonna probably take all night and I'll be right here
Chilling like a villain on my redwood deck
You ain't seen nothing yet
I'll be getting on my Otis, until further notice
I'll be b-b-b-buzzin, b-b-b-buzzin

Mm, baby girl when you get a few in you
Don't you know that you tend to get a little wild
(Get a little wild, get a little wild child, get a little wild)
When you're shooting that fireball whiskey
Get to getting all fireball frisky, you a hot little jockey
Nothing rocks me like you rocking me on a big buzz

Picking off them floaters from the ice tub
Sipping them suds and hanging with my buds
Speaking of buds, who's got a light?
Gonna probably take all night and I'll be right here
Chilling like a villain on my redwood deck
You ain't seen nothing yet
I'll be getting on my order, until further notice
I'll be b-b-b-b-buzzin, b-b-b-b-buzzin
B-b-b-b-buzzin b-b-b-b-buzzin
B-b-b-b-buzzin
Alright
B-b-b-b-buzzin
B-b-b-b-buzzin baby
Buzzin


We've been around and around and around and around
Like a record
And baby, you know every line, every scratch, every note
Every bruise
There's not a song, not a sound in the world
We ain't made together
And it still moves me
The way that you move


This ain't about rock and roll
This ain't gasoline on fire
We're gonna burn down slow
Baby, just take your time
You gotta hold on me
You're all I need, I need to get by
I want that old soul
Give me that old soul tonight


Some things get better the longer they weather
And have been proven
Just like this bottle of red and those blue jeans you left
On the floor
I wanna memorise you if it takes me a lifetime
To do it
And keep waking up, deeper in love
Than I was before


This ain't about rock and roll
This ain't gasoline on fire
We're gonna burn down slow
Baby, just take your time
You gotta hold on me
You're all I need, I need to get by
I want that old soul
Give me that old soul tonight


This ain't about rock and roll
Ain't gasoline on fire
Love is a long sweet road
So, baby, let's take our time


This ain't about rock and roll
This ain't gasoline on fire
We're gonna burn down slow
So, baby, let's take our time
You gotta hold on me
You're all I need, I need to get by
I want that old soul
Give me that old soul tonight


Give me that old soul
This ain't about rock and roll


Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines


Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice


And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away


Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on


Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door


And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away


Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice


And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away, away, away
Yeah I'm still one number away

This concrete road used to just be dirt
We'd drive out here after work
Every Friday night when I was eighteen

This parking lot used to be a field
I parked here in my Oldsmobile
Long before the Sonic and the Walgreens

Not no more
Not no more

My, oh my
Look how the time flies
Look how the world changes
In the blink of an eye
My, oh my
Look how the years have flown
Turning around before you know it
Up and gone
Oh my, oh my, oh my

Times have changed and so have I
I once was young and starry-eyed
Now I have these bittersweet memories

Songs were long and gas was cheap
No cell phones and water was free
Daddy paid and I never had to worry

Not no more
Not no more

My, oh my
Look how the time flies
Look how the world changes
In the blink of an eye
My, oh my
Look how the years have flown
Turning around before you know it
Up and gone
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, my, my

Not no more
Not no more
Not no more

My, oh my
Look how the time flies
Look how the world changes
In the blink of an eye
My, oh my
Look how the years have flown
Turning around before you know it
Up and gone
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my


Hello again, it’s you and me
Kinda always like it used to be
Sipping wine, killing time
Tryna' to solve life’s mysteries
How’s your life? It’s been a while
God it’s good to see you smile
I see you reaching for your keys
Looking for a reason not to leave


If you don’t know if you should stay
If you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory


I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
It’s bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing, I don’t wanna ask


If you go now, I’ll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan


You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You could sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory


If you don’t know if you should stay
And you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be-
(We shouldn't be) we should be
You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You can sing the melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory
You wanna make a memory


Queen of the night
Life of the party
It's all an illusion
You can't hide that big a heart ache
So stop the delusion
Waitin' for someone's rescue
My arms are right here for you


Through the wind and the rain
Through the laughter and pain
Count on me
And when life isn't fair and there's nobody there
I will be
In a world of pretenders
I am your defender
And when it all comes down
I'll be the last one standing


This is for life don't ever doubt it
You've already fallen
Love is alive so stand up and shout it
'Cause destiny's callin'
The others who stand behind me
They don't look nothin' like me




Waitin' for someone's rescue
My arms are right here for you




Yeah yeah
I'll be the last one standing
Through the wind and the rain
Through the laughter and pain
I'll be the last one standing

Boy, ya blow my mind
You can make me crazy

(Ya make me laugh, make me cry, keepin' my heart all shook up)
I'm, so mesmorized
You're the one who can save me

(So, sweetie pie, throw me the line, I think it's time for the hook-up)
Baby, you're my main attraction
Settin' off this chain reaction

Just a little's enough, just the thought of your touch
That's the fun of your love, oh oh baby
(ohhh, ohhh, ohhh-uhhh, yeah-yeah)
The feelin' inside, that's the thrill of the ride
That's the fun of your love, oh oh baby
(ohhh, ohhh, ohhh-uhhh, oh)

Now, I've shown you how
I can push the limit

(make ya laugh, make ya cry, I'm keepin' your heart all shook up)
Still, ya turn me around
With sweet forgiveness
(You toll the line, I'll pay the fine, that's the sign of a good love)

In this twisted world we live in
Please don't stop this love you're givin'

CHORUS

CHORUS

That's the fun of it, baby
Do do do yeah
Oooo, yeah
That's the fun of it, baby
Baby, baby, baby, yeah

Oooo, ohhh-yeah

Ohhh-ooo-whoa-oh-oh-oh-yeah

Uh-huh

That's the fun of it, baby

( Darryl Worley, Wynn Varble, Phil O'Donnell )

Got a call last night from an old friend's wife
Said I hate to bother you
Johnny Ray fell off the wagon
He's been gone all afternoon
I know my buddy so I drove to Skully's
And found him at the bar
I say hey man, what's going on
He said I don't know where to start

Sarah's old car's about to fall apart
And the washer quit last week
We had to put momma in the nursing home
And the baby's cutting teeth
I didn't get much work this week
And I got bills to pay
I said I know this ain't what you wanna hear
But it's what I'm gonna say

(Chorus)
Sounds like life to me it ain't no fantasy
It's just a common case of everyday reality
Man I know it's tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy
It sounds like life to me

Well his face turned red and he shook his head
He said you don't understand
Three kids and a wife depend on me
And I'm just one man
To top it off I just found out
That Sarah's 2 months late
I said hey bartender set us up a round
We need to celebrate

(Chorus)
Sounds like life to me plain old destiny
Yeah the only thing for certain is uncertainty
You gotta hold on tight just enjoy the ride
Get used to all this unpredictability
Sounds like life

Man I know its tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy
Sounds like life to me
Sounds like life

If there's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it

Cause I swear out there ain't where you ought to be
So catch a ride, catch a cab
Don't you know I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby run, cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough

Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

If you ain't got a suit case
Get a box or an old brown paper sack
And pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby just come back

There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it

Baby run
Oh baby run
Baby run

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell, that's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock


Lindy strolls around


Down main streets
Down side streets
Making his way through town he picks up pennies
Saves them for a rainy day
With callous feet he makes his way to see the sun sink in the bay


Lindy strolls around and around and around
Around and around and around
He plays piano at the church when nobody's watching
Takes cigarettes from strangers and sometimes you see Him talking to
Himself, laughing to himself
Lindy strolls around and around and around
Around and around and around


Lindy's seen it all
Storms and hurricanes
Some say he's insane
No one knows his last name
But I believe
He's the salt of the Earth
Just look past his dirty shirt and you will see just what he's worth


Lindy strolls around and around and around
Around and around and around
He plays piano at the church when nobody's watching
Takes cigarettes from strangers and sometimes you see Him talking to
Himself, laughing to himself
Lindy strolls around and around and around
Around and around and around

Ooh


He plays piano at the church when nobody's watching
Takes cigarettes from strangers and sometimes you see
Him talking to himself, laughing to himself
Lindy strolls around and around and around
Around and around and around


Lindy strolls around and around and around

Ooh

Every morning I get up before that rooster crows
Heading straight to somewhere I don't even want to go
Eggs and bacon in my belly and a Folger's coffee buzz
Good ol' radar detector it protects me from the fuzz
Well, I do what I gotta do to get through working that 9 to 5
It's killing me but then again it's keeping me alive

It puts the gas in my truck, butter on my biscuits
A couple bucks when I'm itching for a scratch-off ticket
That poker makes me broker every Saturday night
I still got running water and they ain't cut off the lights
My friends and I, come Friday night, start peeling off them labels
Working hard all week puts beer on the table

Eighteen bucks an hour and a million dollar tan
Women whistle at me while I'm working for the man
Making me some cold hard cash out in that summer sun
Come Friday I'll have money but by Monday I'll have none
Once the bills are paid and that bass boat tank has gone from E to F
I fill that big ol' cooler up there ain't a whole lot left

Well, I got gas in my truck, butter on my biscuits
A couple bucks when I'm itching for a scratch-off ticket
That poker makes me broker every Saturday night
I still got running water and they ain't cut off the lights
My friends and I, come Friday night, start peeling off them labels
Working hard all week puts the beer on the table

Oh, oh, I'm a simple man, yes I am
All I need 's a few good friends and a good job
And a good dog, maybe a woman that understands

A little gas in my truck, some butter on my biscuits
A couple bucks when I'm itching for a scratch-off ticket
That poker makes me broker every Saturday night
I still got running water and they ain't cut off the lights
My friends and I, come Friday night, start peeling off them labels
Working hard all week, yeah, puts the beer on the table
Puts the beer on the table

Would you pass me another one of them cold cans?

(Sara Evans)
I've been tellin' my dreams to the scarecrow
'Bout the places that I'd like to see
I said, friend do you think I'll ever get there
Ah, but he just stands there smilin' back at me
So I confessed my sins to the preacher
About the love I've been prayin' to find
Is there a brown eye'd boy in my future, yeah
He says. girl you've got nothin' but time
But how do you wait for heaven
And who has that much time
And how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know, that you were born, you were born to fly
My daddy, he's grounded like the oak tree
My momma, she is steady as the sun
Oh you know I love my folks
But I keep starin' down the road
Just lookin' for my one chance to run
Yeah, 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird
I will blow in the wind like a sea
I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams
And I will grow up where I'll wander wild and free
Oh, how do you wait for heaven
And who has that much time
And how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know, that you were born
You were born yeah
You were born to fly
So how do you wait for heaven
And who has that much time
And how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know that you were born
You were born to fly fly fly fly
Hey
Ooooh, ooooh

Wooo
Yeah baby
That's right now
C'mon
Here we go!
Alright now
I I I I I...
I I I I I...

Well Bobbi's been a friend since i can't remember when
We all went together to school
A linebacker, a quarterback sacker
Yeahhh Bobbi he's as strong as a mule
So imagine our shock
'Bout ten o'clock down at the Whistle Stop one weekend
Yeah the whole place stopped
You coulda heard a chin drop
The minute he walked in

Cuz it was Bobbi with an I
He isnt just one of the guys
In his pink party dress
You never would guess
He benches 335
You better watch how much you drink
He might look better than you think
If it's the big-boned girl with a platinum curl
Hey then don't be surprised
Yeah that's just Bobbi with an
I I I I I...
I I I I I...

Now Monday mornin' he'll be be drivin' that tow truck
And he ain't takin' no lip
He's been known to knock a few teeth out
If you ask him for a beauty tip
So we live and let live
That's how it is nobody gives a second thought these days
But if somebody hollers
"Hey there's a chick in the men's room!"
We just smile and say

No that's just Bobbi with an I
He isnt just one of the guys
In his pink party dress
You never would guess
He benches 335
You better watch how much you drink
He might look better than you think
If it's the big-boned girl with a platinum curl
Hey then don't be surprised
Yeah that's just Bobbi with an

Hey (Hey) Who's that girl (Who's that girl) with those shapely sexy thighs?

That's just Bobbi with an I
He isnt just one of the guys
In his pink party dress
You never would guess
He benches 335
You better watch how much you drink
He might look better than you think
If it's the big-boned girl with a platinum curl
Hey then don't be surprised
Yeah that's just Bobbi with an
I I I I I...
I I I I I...

I left your key, I hit the road
I didn't want to but I had to let you go
Ohhhhhh, ohhhhhh
I know you're shocked, I know you're mad
I know it hurts to know a good thing went so bad
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh
And I really do hate that you hate me
And I really do hate that you hate me

Chorus:
I don't need a white veil, I got a black dress
Don't need a preacher, no no not yet
Don't have the blues when I've got my red wine
Out on the town, or in the city
Ain't nothin like the way it fits me
So take that gown and lay it down to rest
Cause I'm better in a black dress
I'm just a girl, I'm not a wife
I just need a little time to love my life
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh
I wanna dance, I wanna yell
I wanna band, I don't want no wedding bells
Ohhhhhh, ohhhhh
And maybe one day you'll forgive me
And maybe one day...
Chorus
I'm better in a black dress, call me a hot mess
I feel so good, ooh I gotta confess
I like the way it feels in cowboy boots or heels
So listen up, baby here's the deal
Chorus
I'm better in a black dress
I'm better in a black dress

(Darryl Worley/J.B. Rudd/Vip Vipperman)

I show up for work on time at least five days a week
Punch that clock and toe the line just to make ends meet
Every day on my way home I pass them neon lights
But I been thinking all day long about stopping in tonight

I might get a little sideways
Like I did in the old days
Every once in awhile you know
I slip off the straight and narrow
Sitting down on a barstool
Cutting up like a dang fool
Now and then on Fridays
I might get a little sideways

I'm gonna call my baby up when that quitting whistle blows
Girl put on your dancing shoes and grab my party clothes
Meet me down at the rendezvous on highway seventeen
We'll stoke up that jukebox and let off a little steam

We might get a little sideways
Like we did in the old days
Every once in awhile you know
We slip off the straight and narrow
Sitting down on a barstool
Cutting up like a dang fool
Now and then on Fridays
We might get a little sideways

My old man's backhand used to land
Hard on the side of my head
I just learned to stay out of his way
There been street fights, blue lights, long nights
With the world sittin' on my chest
It just showed me how much I can take
Hard times, bad luck
Sometimes life sucks

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop lovin' me

The bank man, the bossman, the law man
All tryin' to get their hands on me
And I ain't even done a damn thing wrong
I've been way-laid, freight trained, short changed
By bigger and badder men
And all I've got to say is "bring it on"
Hard rain, rough roads, so my life goes

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me

I need you
Gotta have you
In my life, by my side
Every day I'm alive
Every night that I'm breathin'
I'm needin' you

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me

Ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me


Yeah
This could be it, I think I'm in love
It's love this time
It just seems to fit, I think I'm in love
This love is mine


I can see you with me when I'm older
All my lonely nights are finally over
You took the weight of the world off my shoulders (the world just goes away)


Oh, when you kiss me (when you kiss me)
I know you miss me (I know you miss me)
And when you're with me
The world just goes away
The way you hold me (the way you kiss me)
The way you show me (I know you miss me)
That you adore me
Oh, when you kiss me
Oh, yeah


You are the one, I think I'm in love
Life has begun (I think I'm in love)


I can see the two of us together
I know I'm gonna be with you forever
Love couldn't be any better (the world just goes away)


Oh, when you kiss me (when you kiss me)
I know you miss me (I know you miss me)
And when you're with me
The world just goes away
The way you hold me (the way you kiss me)
The way you show me (I know you miss me)
That you adore me
Oh, when you kiss me
Oh, yeah


I can see you with me when I'm older
All my lonely nights are finally over
You took the weight of the world off my shoulders (the world just goes away)


When you kiss me (when you kiss me)
I know you miss me (I know you miss me)
And when you're with me
The world just goes away
The way you hold me (the way you kiss me)
The way you show me (I know you miss me)
That you adore me
The world just goes away (when you kiss me)
When you kiss me (I know you miss me)
I know you miss me (And when you're with me)


Oh, the world just goes away
When you kiss me

You might say she started out
Without what folks 'round here call a fair shake
A little girl with no shoes on her feet
Tangled hair
Not a nickel to her name
And not a care
But no matter what
Her smile came shining through

Cause a rose is a rose is a rose
And everybody knows
A little sunlight and room to grow
Was all she needed

And seeing her face in town
Is like springtime coming around
Well I guess it just goes to show
A rose is a rose is a rose

Tommy Lee always knew what he would do
Cause she moved him
Deep down in his heart
And everybody smiled at such a pair

Could they last with two different worlds
And sides of the tracks
But no matter what
Their love came shining through

Cause a rose is a rose is a rose
And everybody knows
A little sunlight and room to grow
Was all she needed
And seeing her face in town
Was like springtime coming around
Well I guess it just goes to show

A rose is a rose
It always finds a way to shine
Beauty is a state of mind
And seeing her face in town
Was like springtime coming around
Well, I guess it just goes to show
A rose is a rose is a rose


You got the gas
I got the matches
We gonna turn this town to ashes
Cause they ain't never seen nothing like us
Ain't heard loud till we turn it up
I got the wild
You got the crazy
You know that's why I love you baby
Cause your motor runs just as fast as mine
Pedal to the metal, keep your throttle down all night
And we only get one life


Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here


People talk girl
You know damn well
When they got a good tale to tell
Let's give them something they ain't never seen
A little Rated R redneck dream
Let's blaze a trail through the dirty south
Or give them something they can talk about
A little story that they won't forget
Long after we ride off into the sunset
Baby, cause we ain't dead yet, baby


Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here


We only get one chance around
This runaway roller coaster train
And it ain't slowing down
So baby they're gonna remember our name


Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
No, we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here

Phone rings 2 am
Oh, no here we go again
Its you on my caller ID
In the middle of a catasify
How many times can your heart break?
I've heard all that I can take

What a shame
The whole world can stop turning
Its burning you up inside
Too bad you're so full of pride

What a pity
Nobody understands you
A complicated man who
Knows hes always right

What a shame
What a pity
What a pity
What a shame

What a shame
What a pity
What a pity
What a shame

Like Tom Cruise and Russell Crow
Holliwood's where you should go
Lord knows you've got the act of drama king
And thats a fact

How many times can one sky fall?
I can't take another call

What a shame
The whole world can stop turning
Its burning you up inside
Too bad you're so full of pride

What a pity
Nobody understands you
A complicated man who
Knows hes always right

What a shame
What a pity
What a pity
What a shame

What a shame
What a pity
What a pity
What a shame

Some people never learn
And thats too bad
You can't get it through your head
I don't want you back

What a shame
Oh, what a pity
What a shame
What a pity
What a shame

What a shame
Burning you up inside
Too bad you are so full of pride

What a pity
Nobody understands you
A complicated man who
Knows hes always right

What a shame, Lord knows
What a pity
What a shame, Lord knows
What a pity

What a shame
What a pity
What a pity
What a shame

What a shame
What a pity
What a pity
What a shame


I like your lips like I like my Coca-Cola, yeah
Oh how it pops and fizzes
You like my shirt like I like it when you hold my hand
The way ‒ it fits ‒ has got me feeling lucky


Lookie, who is stunnin', who! You got that somethin'
Boy I wanna be where you are, and I'm gunnin' for ya'
Can't even fall for some other man, cause brother man
You know how to get hip to my heart


All the girls in town look you up and look you down, I know
So... come on and pick your kitten
Purr, baby, purr, go ahead and say the word ‒ let's go!
I think I'm the one you're digging; got me feeling lucky


Lookie, who is stunning, whoo! You got that somethin'
Boy I wanna be where you are, and I'm gunnin' for ya'
Can't even fall for some other man, cause brother man
You know how to get hip to my heart


Tell me now, who? Who?
Tell me now, who? You


You play it coo-ool, you play it so coo-coo-cool
What am I supposed to do, when you play it so cool
And I got the hots for you?




I said, you know how to get hip to my heart
I said, you know how to get hip to my heart

Barbed wire fence carving out a hillside
Cutting holes in the midday sun
Like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust
I love the rhythm of an old grey blacktop, 33's just whistling by
Steer the wheel, one handed on a two lane, hugging that line
I got the windows down, no one else around singing


(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
Come on, come on sing along, sing along to my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I hit the brakes for an old New Holland, hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay field's just been cut
I got the windows down, way out of town singing…


(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

The only way today could get better, girl what I'm thinking
Is I can pick you up, you slide in this truck
And I can hear you singing

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Let me hear you sing it
Ooh-ooh-ooh


(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles we're rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song

This is my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
This is my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
Come on, come on, sing along
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
To my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)

It was almost Christmas time
And there I stood in another line
Trying to buy that last gift or two
Not really in the Christmas mood
Standing right in front of me
Was a little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing 'round like little boys do
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes
And his clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say

Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight

He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the Cashier said, "Son, there's not enough here"
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said "Mama made Christmas good at our house
"Though most years she just did without
"Tell me, sir, what am I going to do
"Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes"

So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out
I'll never forget the look on his face when he said
"Mama's gonna look so great"

Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight

I knew I'd caught a glimpse of Heaven's love
As he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent that little boy
To remind me just what Christmas is all about


There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it


And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it


Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know?
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it


And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it


It's yours if you want it


Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby, your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it


And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
And I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it


Oh, oh
Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing
That I could beg, steal, or borrow
Baby, your name is written on it
Baby, it's yours if you want it


I know I'm still young
But, I know how I feel
I might not have too much experience
But, I know when love is real
By the way my heart starts pounding
When I look into your eyes
I might look a little silly
Standing with my arms stretched open wide


I love you this big
Eyes have never seen this big
No-one's ever dreamed this big
And I'll spend the rest of my life
Explaining what words cannot describe but, I'll try
I love you this big


I'll love you to the moon and back
I'll love you all the time
Deeper than the ocean
And higher than the pines
Because girl, you do something to me
Deep down in my heart
I know I look a little crazy
Standing with my arms stretched all apart




So much bigger than I ever dreamed my heart ever would
I love you this big
And I'd write your name in stars across the sky
If I could, I would




I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day


You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...


Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt


Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay


You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (dirt)
You know you came from it (dirt)
And some day you'll return to


Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt


I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said "the world comes right to my window every day"... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)


Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt


Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt


See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, make good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen
(You know you came from it and some day you'll return to it)

Barefoot in the bed 'a your truck
On a blanket lookin' up
Half a moon peekin' down at us
From underneath the clouds
Teenage kids sneakin' out again
Heard the thunder rollin' in
We were fallin' the moment when
It all came pourin' down

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
What I felt for you that day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothin' in our way
Except for the Georgia rain

Cotton fields remember when
Flash 'a lightnin' drove us in
We were soaked down to the skin
By the time we climbed inside
And I don't remember what was poundin' more
Heart in my chest or the hood of that Ford
As the sky fell in, the storm clouds poured
Worlds away outside

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
All the love we made
Just you and me down that old dirt road
No one saw a thing
Except for the Georgia rain

Screen door flappin' in the wind
Same ol' house I grew up in
Can't believe I'm back again
After all these years away
You fixed your Daddy's house up nice
I saw it yesterday when I drove by
Looks like you've made youself a real good life
What else can I say

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
The way I loved you to this day
The ol' dirt road's paved over now
Nothin' here's the same
Except for the Georgia rain

He gives her attention, he's constantly, carefully planting the seeds
The only thing missing, is really the only thing she needs
And he can't give that to her and she can't find it with him
So she'll have to find her way out of love she's not really in

(Chorus)
She can live with what goes with leavin
She knows it's the only way
Though it kills her to give up believin
She can't live with herself if she stays
She could settle for what she'd be feelin
If she gave in and worked this one out
She doesn't want the kind of love she can live with
She wants the kind of love she can't live without

She looks in the mirror and sees all the sadness in her eyes
It's never been clearer what he's askin her to sacrifice
But she can't be his forever, she can't even be his for now
She'll have to be kind to them both and let go of him somehow

(Chorus)
She can live with what goes with leavin
She knows it's the only way
Though it kills her to give up believin
She can't live with herself if she stays
She could settle for what she'd be feelin
If she gave in and worked this one out
She doesn't want the kind of love she can live with
She wants the kind of love she can't live without

And the hardest part is she loves him
But she doesn't want the kind of love she can live with
She wants the kind of love she can't live without


I wake up feeling, in my soul I'm
Living someone else's life
I'm turnin' into concrete, harder than these city streets
Where no one even cares if I'm alive


I gotta get it right, mmm
Get it right, mmm mmm


There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home


My mind's heavy and I can't sleep, not even a memory
Is good enough to get me through the night, mmm
I'm longin' for the real thing, people who know the real me
And all the ways to love me back to life


Mmm, I gotta get it right, ooh, yeah
Get it right, ooh, yeah


There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home


Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same (just not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same (just not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same


There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me (oh, baby)
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like (hey!)
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go (yeah!)
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home


(Nothin' in the world)
I'm feeling lost in all the madness
(Nothin' in the world that feels like I'm)
I need somewhere to ease my mind
Coming home (comin' home)
These sidewalks filled with different faces (ooh-hoo)
So many places, but there's none like mine
Coming home


This boy here wants to move too fast
He sees my future as having a past
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so


That boy there, well he's playing a fool
He thinks he's funny and he thinks he's cool
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so


Cheap date, bad taste, another night gone to waste
Talking about nothing in so many words
It's not like I'm not tryin'
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once


And I, I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet, the more I love my dog


Here's this guy, thinks he's bad to the bone
He wants to pick me up and take me home
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so


Cage fights, PlayStation, X-Games, Raider Nation
Oversize pants with an ego to match
It's not like I'm not tryin'
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once


And I, I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet, the more I love my dog


Why can't they be like the one's that mean everything to me?
The warm and loyal, open and friendly
It's not like I'm not tryin'
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once


I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet, the more I love my...
I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time findin'
The more boys I meet, the more I love my dog


The more I love my dog


You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?


Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask


What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?


What if the sky falls (sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'?
Or I could kiss you (you should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it


What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon


You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn


What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?


Away (away)
What if?


Maybe one day, I'll just let it all go
Let every shade of my true colors show
Keep loving me 'til I lost all control eventually
Never wanna be, never wanna be that girl
With the million needs who keeps running your world
Boy, do you lie when you say I look good tonight?


I see a mess in the mirror, but you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in, but you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong, but you hear a song
You hear a song


They keep talking, all the ghosts from my past
Heart broken, can't get over it fast
Just give it up, stays around and it never leaves


I see a mess in the mirror, but you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in, but you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong, but you hear a song
You hear a song


You hear a song, a one note symphony
Baby come on, and sing it back to me


I see a mess in the mirror, but you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in, but you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong, but you hear a song
You hear a song


Now I ain't sayin' them LA ladies don't know what they're doing
And I been in love with New York City a time or two
I had some Seattle coffee, some Chicago wind
Some Kansas sweet fields I'd love to see again
But the fireflies play where the cattails grow
And them southern girls, they talk nice and slow with


Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl


Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long


A southern girl's mama probably taught her how a lady should act
But a southern girl's probably got a barn somewhere reared out back
She'll get a little hay in her hair, her tires in the mud
She's been caught in the rain, and washed in the blood
Likes cherries in her coke, takes a little sip
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them


Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl


If you've ever seen Savannah heat up when the stars come out
Well, then, fellas, come on, you know what I'm talking about


Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl


Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long


Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire


I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire


The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild




And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire


I hear you're out there now and you're doing alright
A new lease on life in Hollywood
Riding around with the ragtop down
Bet the west coast sun looks good on you
Wasn't very long ago we were sitting
On a lost dirt road by the railroad tracks
If you ever think about that
And wonder where I'm at and wanna come back


I'm sitting on a tailgate in the middle of a stargaze
Wishing you were in my arms
Chilling right here, baby if you want it
I've got a cold beer with your name on it
Back 40 on a Friday night
Me and you dancing in the firelight
Girl you gotta admit it sounds pretty good, don't it?
I've got a cold beer with your name on it


Pop the top, kick back like we used to do
Sipping all night long to your favorite tunes
If you ever get tired of the concrete life
Those honking horns, them flashing lights
Got a jar of shine if you need it
Under the seat, you know where I keep it
Hey girl turn off your cell phone
Put your blue jeans on, get back home




Cooler loaded down, picture perfect view
All that's missing now is… you




Girl you gotta admit it sounds pretty good, don't it?
Got a cold beer with your name on it

(written by Shaye Smith and Ken Harrell)

Mom brought us lemonade
On a Coca-Cola tray
Ice rattling in plastic glasses
We'd see who drink the fastest
In a split second we were gone
Racing cross the fresh cut lawn
And we were running barefoot in the grass
Barefoot in the grass

When I was twelve I started liking boys
She was still playing with her toys
I pointed out that she was only nine
And I didn't need her tagging behind
Then I would jump on my red bicycle
I'd look back and I 'd get tickled
She was running barefoot in the grass
Barefoot in the grass

Chorus:
And it brings a smile to my face
Seeing her, no shoes in a footrace
Running as fast as she can
Waving her hands and calling out my name
Little Sister
Oh, I wonder if she knows how bad I miss her

I remember being so confused
When mom and daddy broke the news
I never even saw her cry
Though I could tell she was hurting inside
But, now I'm sure she's got a full head of hair
And I know that somewhere up there
She's running barefoot in the grass
Barefooot in the grass

(Repeat Chorus)
Mom brought us lemonade
On a Coca-Cola tray
Ice rattling in plastic glasses
We'd see who drink the fastest
Love to see you run
Little sister, run
Barefoot in the grass, barefoot in the grass


My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?

Do you pour a little something on the rocks?
Slide down the hallway in your socks?
When you undress, do you leave a path?
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath?

My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?


I want to know
I want to know
I want to know


Do you break things when you get mad?
Eat a box of chocolates cause you're feeling bad?
Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails?
Call up mamma when all else fails?

Who are you when I'm not around?
When the door is locked and the shades are down?
Do you listen to your music quietly?
And when it feels just right, are you thinking of me?


I want to know
I want to know
I want to know


My oh my, you're so good-looking
But who are you when I'm not looking?

Oh, the last ten years, it's been quite trip
Over thirty-six-hundred spins around without a cosmic slip
But within the realm of our atmosphere
We're 'bout as out of whack as we've ever been in a million years
We watched the Y2K scare in a panic
An' we watched as time proved Nostrodamus wrong
An' we watched as Mother Nature shook the planet
An' cellular replaced the telephone
We lost Charlie Brown, Ray Charles an' Johnny Cash
We even lost Superman, mhm

Well, the last ten years, look at the hills we've climbed
The best golfer's black, the best rapper's white an' it's about damn time
But we best beware, there's a brand new fight, you see
An' I hate to say we might be our own worst enemy
We watched Oklahoma sifting through the damage
An' we watched a US President get caught
We watched shareholders watch their savings vanish
We all cried when we watched those towers fall
We lost Minnie Pearl, Ron Reagan and Sam I Am
We even lost Superman, mhm

Expensive gas an' free downloads
The dot-com boom, an' reality shows
What's gonna happen next is anybody's guess
Satellite radio and hybrid cars
Hand-held computers an' a trip to Mars
It's all become a part of who we are
In the last ten years

In the last ten years
We lost George Harrison, John Paul and June Carter-Cash
Hell, we even lost Superman
Gonna miss you. Chris...


It's my third cup of coffee
Fifth time I've said I'm sorry
The sun slowly peeking through the glass
Says we been up all night
We both know where this is going
It's been a long time coming
Is it really over, is this really goodbye
Maybe I should say something
Maybe you'd change your mind
Maybe, maybe buy a little more time


But I got nothing'
No magic words
To stop your leaving'
To end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm just staring into space
Praying please, please let me think of something
Cause I got nothing'


I watch you pack your things
You look down at your ring
You slowly slip it off and then
You lay it on our bed
Maybe I should pick it up
And get down on my knees
Tell you what you wanna hear
And give you what you need


But I got nothing'
No magic words
To stop your leaving'
To end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm just staring into space
Praying please, please let me think of something
Cause I got nothing'


You're almost at the door
And you stop and turn around
Your eyes are begging me
Please say something right now


But I got nothing'
No magic words
To stop your leaving'
To end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm just staring into space
Praying please, please let me think of something
Cause I got nothing'


I ain't lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone
More than I'd like to, but I’m okay with stayin' home
My how the last few months have changed
I’m smilin' more despite the pain


I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat


I hate waitin', ain't no patience in these hands
I'm not complainin', sometimes it's hard to change a man
I think I'm stronger than I was
I let God do what he does


I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin'  out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat


I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
If it's workin', I don't know, when I get done the thing may not float
But I'm learnin' how to build a better boat


Got an old dog, it don't like me much
That thing starts to bark his head off every time we touch
Sitting on the porch listening to the radio
We sing every single song we know
Even the ones we don't
When she moves a little closer
She puts her hand in mine
Oh what I wouldn't give just to stop the hands of time


She's got long blonde hair and big blue eyes
I got all I ever need when that girl is by my side
Everything I love is there inside
A little brick house on the Oklahoma-Texas Line


She's got a part time job at the Tastee-freeze
She took the weekend off to spend a little bit of time with me
I got an old car we drove to the edge of town
We stopped by Old Man Millers' farm
Just to watch the world spin around
And she moves a little closer
She puts her lips to mine
Ain't funny how the good Lord out does himself sometimes




Everything I love is there inside
A little brick house with a black top drive
Big oak tree with our names carved on the side




Oh here they come
Long blonde hair and big blue eyes
Everything I love

(Brett James/Del Gray/Thom McHugh)

In case I haven't told ya lately
Just in case it doesn't show
I'm still enchanted by you baby
And I just wanted you to know

You were the first one
And you'll be the last one
You are the only one, I swear
You took me to heaven
Our first night together
And you still take me there

Whoa I
Just to have you in my arms tonight
Oh, how could I ask for more
You give me hope and strength
You give me life
Your love is all I'm living for

You were the first one
And you'll be the last one
You are the only one, I swear
You took me to heaven
Our first night together
And you still take me there

You take me higher
Than I ever dreamed I'd go
With you I leave the worries
Of this troubled world below

You took me to heaven
Our first night together
And you still take me there

Oh you took me to heaven
Our first night together
And you still take me
Darlin' you still take me
Baby you still take me
There


I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl
I'm a back row sinner at a tent revival
But she believes in me like she believes her Bible
And loves me like Jesus does


I'm a lead foot leaning on a souped-up Chevy
I'm a good old boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me when my sins make me heavy
And loves me like Jesus does


All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
The devil, man, no, he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does


I always thought she'd give up on me one day
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway
But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday
That she loves me like Jesus does




Yes, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
That devil, man, he don't stand a chance
She loves me like Jesus does
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl


I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, all I know I couldn’t stop


Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look


Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart


Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame


Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face


Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart


Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry


Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Put your best dress on
Tonight we're gone
It's been way too long since we've had a night to ourselves
Dinner out, touchin' me
Come on babe, we'll have the time of our lives

I wanna be holdin' on to you
The way that I used to
Just like it was before the world rolled in between us
I know it fits like a glove
Slip into it, zip it up
Baby, put your best dress on

Put your best dress on
You know, the one we bought down in Rio
We're not gonna come back home til the sun comes up
So what do you say
Just you and me
Fall in love
When the first song starts til the last dance ends

I wanna be holdin' on to you
The way that I used to
Just like it was before the world rolled in between us
I know it fits like a glove
Slip into it, zip it up
Baby, put your best dress on

Oh, and after this evening is over
And when it falls from your shoulder

I wanna be holdin' on to you
The way that I used to
Just like it was before the world rolled in between us
I know it fits like a glove
Slip into it, zip it up
Baby, put your best dress on

Slip into it, zip it up
Baby, put your best dress on
Put your best dress on

Downtown, stoplight, red car rolls by
What else can I do, but wonder if it's you
Scanning the stations, every song they're playin'
Is like a soundtrack, to the love we had
I should be over you by now, but every time I turn around...

It's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart
What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing
But it's always something

Lunch time, a new place
Waitress says her name
Why does it have to be, Emily
Corner store, stop in
Someone ask, "How ya been?"
I say I wouldn't know
I really gotta go
Wish I could forget you, but I don't know how
Cause every time I turn around...

It's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart
What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing
But it's always something


The bar was empty
I was sweeping up the floor
That's when she walked in
I said, "I'm sorry but we're closed"
And she said "I know
But I'm afraid I left my purse"
I said, "I put one back behind the bar
I bet it's probably yours"
And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said, "You'll only get this back on one condition"


And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced


And from that moment
There was never any doubt
I had found the one
That I had always dreamed about
And then one evening
When she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt
And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, "This is the last thing I expected"
And then she took me by the hand
And said, "I'll only marry you on one condition"




Like no one else had ever danced before
I can't explain what happened on that floor
But the music played
We held each other close
And we danced
Yeah, we danced


When you hear somebody say somebody hits like a girl
How does that hit you?
Is that such a bad thing?
When you hear a song that they play sayin' you run the world
Do you believe it?
Will you live to see it?

When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it
Just cause she was wearing a skirt
Oh, is that how that works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best?
Or did he save the best for last?

We're wastin' all our time and energy it seems
To mend our broken hearts as if they were machines
There ain't a tool around that could make us tight

Hell I don't know where all the good times went
Had a pocket full of love now there ain't nothin' left but lint
A handful of good times don't make it right

So move on
There ain't nothing you can do about it
Come on
Love is like a puzzle when the pieces don't fit
There ain't nothing you can do about it
So move on

You've got to be you and baby I've got to be me
And I don't wanna stay just because I don't wanna leave
I got one foot out the door
I got one foot in my mouth

We're always sayin' things that we don't really mean
Like I love you and I'll be with you for all eternity
We don't have that long to work this out

So move on
There ain't nothing you can do about it
Come on
Love is like a puzzle when the pieces don't fit
There ain't nothing you can do about it

And I tried to find the answers
And I've read all the books
Watched all the daytime shows
Sometimes we're the victims
Sometimes we're the crooks
That's just the way it goes
Oh, yeah

So move on
There ain't nothing you can do about it
Come on
Love is like a puzzle when the pieces don't fit
There ain't nothing you can do
So move on
There ain't nothing you can do about it
Come on
Love is like a puzzle when the pieces don't fit
There ain't nothing you can do about it
Move on
Move on
Just move on


She's like staring at the sun
She could easily blind someone
Other women, I see none
She's like staring at the sun


She gets on to you
Under your skin like a tattoo
She'll always be there
She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song
She ain't going nowhere


She's like standing in the rain
Washes all my cares away
At the end of a long, hot day
She's like standing in the rain


Oh, she gets on to you
Under your skin like a tattoo
She'll always be there
She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song
She ain't going nowhere

She gets on to you
Under your skin like a tattoo
She'll always be there
She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song
She ain't going nowhere


She's like finally coming home
And seeing that light in the window on
After being gone too long
She's like finally coming home
Standing in the rain
Staring at the sun

He had a stroke in '95
They thought it best that he reside in a nursing home
His family vowed they'd never leave him
Last time they came to see him was three years ago

He spent his whole life providin'
Now he was down to relyin' on medicare
The nurses took a likin' to him
They'd get his wheelchair out and push him on sunny days

He couldn't walk, he couldn't speak
Seemed so far outta reach
But in his mind, as far as they knew, he could be:

Fly fishin';
Workin' on that Firebird engine
Runnin' 99 proof moonshine cross that county line
3, 2, 1 and ignition: off on some space shuttle mission
Playin' QB for the Cowboy's:
Getting high on the crowd noise and the bright lights
'Cause deep inside, things were rockin' in the mind
Of John J. Blanchard

One afternoon in June
A nurse saw his finger move. She bout had a heart attack
Went screamin' down the hall:
"Hey it's a miracle ya'll. I think he's comin' back."

The doctors all rushed in, said:
"Do you know what year this is?
"How many fingers am I holdin', and where've you been?"

And he said:
Fly fishin';
Workin' on that Firebird engine
Runnin' 99 proof moonshine cross that county line
3, 2, 1 and ignition: off on some space shuttle mission
An' playin' QB for the Cowboy's
Getting high on the crowd noise and the bright lights
Yeah, all this time, things were rockin' in the mind
Of John J. Blanchard

He had a stroke in '95
They thought it best that he reside in a nursing home

It started out
Summer fun
Chasin' Ally Brooke with a water gun
She'd laugh
And she'd scream
She'd run and say 'You can't catch me!'

Well time passed, I turned sixteen
Cruisin' from the Sonic to the Dairy Queen, yeah
Runnin' the roads we ruled like kings
We'd say 'Here comes Ally with her hot friends
They got water balloons in their hands
Aw man they got me now lets get them…'

Chasin' girls
What a life
Man I love them
Can't get enough of them
From their toes up to their curls
Chasin' girls
Hard to catch
Sweet to hold
Even tougher to let them go
Nothin' like it in the whole wide world
Chasin' girls

Caught Ally Brooke
And that was that
Bought a bungalow on a cul-de-sac, yeah
Settled in and I knew
My girl-chasin' days were through

Until she handed me an EPT
I said 'Tell me what this blue strip means Al'
Well that was then and now our twins are three
And it's 'Who left the popsicle on the couch?'
'Don't let that dog lick you in the mouth!'
Up and down all around this house
And right back to where I started out

Chasin' girls
What a life
Man I love them
Can't get enough of them
From their toes up to their curls
Chasin' girls
Hard to catch
Sweet to hold
Even tougher to let them go
Nothin' like it in the whole wide world
Chasin' girls

Last night I had a nightmare
The future was now here
My little girls were in their teens
And then these teenage boys appeared
Oh no… yeah

Chasin' girls
Hard to catch
Sweet to hold
Even tougher to let them go
Nothin' like it in the whole wide world
Chasin' girls

Ooooooooh
Chasin' girls
Ooooooooh


I told myself a thousand times it wouldn't end like this
But here I am standing at the door with no more walls to hit
I didn't notice it was over til it was too late
All the tears are cried and it's time to walk away


So hello suitcase, hello pictures on the floor
Hello heartache, hello slamming doors
Hello Silverado running in the drive
Hello freedom, hello goodbye
Ooooh


I never knew this gravel drive could be so damn long
And I never thought I'd ever be this close to being gone
I wonder if she wonders if I'll turn this truck around
I wish I could cause it hurts like hell but it's too late for that now


So hello highway, hello city limit sign
Hello sunset, hello Jackson county line
Hello radio go and play that song tonight
Hello freedom, hello goodbye


Oh I did the best to make the best of us
But hell sometimes love just ain't enough


So hello teardrops, hello empty space
Hello memories, hello love we used to make
Hello Jesus won't you help me through the night
Hello tomorrow, hello goodbye


Your lips are moving but I can't hear you
Wish you would talk your way right over here

I see you looking, boy, but I can't feel you
Why don't we just disappear?


I'm getting jealous of the way he's leaning
You make him feel like it's all alright

Boy, if you wanna know the things I've been thinking
You'd be meeting me outside


Cause last night out was calling you mine
Discovering each other til the morning light
And I don't know where this is going
But it sure feels right
I don't wanna leave you here tonight
So let's do what we did last night...again


Your friends are looking like they're ready for leaving
Girl, you look like you can't make up your mind

I'm fumbling, acting like I can't find my keys

Well, maybe you could give me a ride


Cause last night out was calling you mine
Discovering each other til the morning light
And I don't know where this is going
But it sure feels right
I don't wanna leave you here tonight
So let's do what we did last night...again

I can't wait, I can't let you go
I can't wait, I won't let you go
Let you go

Cause last night out was calling you mine
Discovering each other til the morning light
And I don't know where this is going
But it sure feels right
I don't wanna leave you here tonight
So let's do what we did last night...again


Your lips are moving, but I can't hear you
Wish you would talk your way right over here..

Well lately you've been driving me mad
Cause you're the best thing that I've ever had
And I want you
I want you bad

So come on
Let's give it a whirl
And we can shake up
The whole wide world
And I want you
Oh I want you girl

Well I'm running out of things to do
I've got no other place but you

Never no you'll never be sad
I'm gonna make you feel so glad
And I want you
Oh I want you bad

Well I'm running out of things to do
I've got no other place but you

I'm thinking
I'm gonna lose my head
Ya know the phone line
Is taking to much breath
And I want you
Oh I want you bad

Oh and I want you
Oh I want you bad


Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me


'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back


A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


I said, "Hey girl, what's your name?
Haven't I seen you before?
I recognize them dark green eyes
When you do-si-doed across the floor"
"Are you alone, or are you with someone?"
She said, "As a matter of fact I'm not"
So I took her hand, that's when it all began
And we headed towards the parking lot


And she said, "Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I have not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high"
I said, "Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride"


We went riding around rocking to the sound
Of "A Country Boy Can Survive"
And I knew then she was my kindof a girl
Cause she was singing every single line
Then she slid on over put my hand on her shoulder
And I asked her what she wanted to do
She said, "It really don't matter where we go
Just as long as I'm riding with you"


And she said, "Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I am not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high"
I said, "Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride"


So we headed out to Old Tobacco Road
Put the tailgate down and we made love
She said "A true country boy is hard to find
But I found one wilder then any eight second ride"


And she said, "Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I am not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high"
I said, "Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride"


Yeah, hold on tight because it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride

(Keith Anderson/Bob DiPiero/David Lee Murphy)

I think it's safe to say you've had a bad day
And somethin' even tells me maybe I should stay away
But I can't, I'm livin' dangerously
Baby, call me crazy, I think I know what you need
Girl, I've got your remedy

(Chorus)
Somebody needs a hug
A little personal attention
Some good ol' lovin' and affection
Yeah, I talkin' full body, good Lord Almighty
Whooo, c'mon and get you some
You need to be wrapped up
Snug as a bug in a rug
A big ol' teddy bear squeeze
Where you can barely breathe
Somebody needs a hug

I see you're not convinced, you're still on defense
And I'd be wise to disappear if I had any sense
But I don't, no obviously
I think I can fix it, baby, don't resist it
Darlin, it's easy to see

(Repeat Chorus)
You start to smile and you're bitin' your lip
And girl I know what that means
You're walkin' over, you're gettin' closer
Looks like you finally see


Every Sunday I see people
Filing in through those front doors
Got a cross up on that steeple
Yeah it's time to praise the lord
Some watch it on their TV
Sittin' on the couch
Me, I get in my old Bronco and point those headlights out
Oh, ain't got too many miles to go
To save my soul


Hey I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set
Yeah I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
I'm as close to God as I can get
Whoa, whoa, yeah


Now there ain't nothing wrong
With puttin' on your Sunday best
Me, I won't be wearin'
Nothin' that I can't get wet
I just think about how small I am and life after we're gone
I'm out her by myself, but I know I'm not alone
Yeah, I got all the proof I need
And it sure makes me believe


When I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set
Yeah I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
I'm as close to God as I can get
Whoa, whoa, yeah

Amen
I'm in heaven watching all these waves roll in
Amen
When I'm lost I know where to get found again


Yeah I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set
Yeah I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
I'm as close to God as I can get
Yeah I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set
Yeah I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
I'm as close to God as I can get
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, yeah

So, you lit her cigarette
You're feeling pretty good
You think you've got a shot
Most girls, you probably would
Yeah, this is that kind of place
But she ain't that kind of girl
You're reading it all wrong
Let me tell you about her

She only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of being let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks

Did you ask her to dance?
Let me guess, she told you no
Got to take her someplace quiet
And see how far that goes
Oh, don't take it all that hard
When she smiles and turns you down
For a complicated girl
She ain't that hard to figure out

She only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of being let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks

Oh, she only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of being let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks
Yeah, that's right


Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand


I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man


There's no hurry
Don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer
Lets go over
What I had in mind
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand


I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man


Ain't nobody ever love nobody
The way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how
Long I've wanted to
Lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand


I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling that was quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man


Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain


And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love


If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby


Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams


And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love


If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm


I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace


Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man


Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm


I'm sorry, ma'am, don't hang up
Nah, I ain't selling nothing
I don't know what I was thinking when I called
I guess I wasn't
Yeah, I was just down on my luck
Having some trouble with this ol' truck
And the guy that used to pick up
He could fix anything


Sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
You've got dad's old number


I learned it by heart when I was 6
He never did change it
I've called it in trouble
With good and bad news
And break-ups, yeah, you name it
Sure, I've got some friends I can call
They're always there if I need to talk
But good as they are, it ain't their fault
Sometimes I just need him


And sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then, I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
You've got dad's old number


So I apologize in advance
'Cause there's a damn good chance
When I meet that girl
Get that job
And I need to tell my best friend
You're probably gonna hear from me again


'Cause sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then, I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
Yeah, you've got dad's old number


Dad's old number


I'm about as small town as you can get
I'm talkin' two lanes, one cop
Plowed up fields catchin' red sunsets
We get nervous when the rain stops
Never had a reason to leave this place
Never had a reason to get away


The wheels just touched down in California
Man, I don't even like to fly
I just gotta see her with the sun
Shinin' on her in the water
Chrome aviators on her eyes
I never had a reason to get away
I never had a reason to see this place
She gave me a reason to love L.A


She said she had to be where that sun dropped down
I'm talkin' fast lane, goodbye
She'd chase it all the way 'til that road ran out
And parked it underneath the pink sky
I wanna hear those waves come crashing in
I wanna feel that sand and that wind
I wanna go everywhere she's been
Hold her again


The wheels just touched down in California
Man, I don't even like to fly
I just gotta see her with the sun
Shinin' on her in the water
Chrome aviators on her eyes
I never had a reason to get away
I never had a reason to see this place


The wheels just touched down in California
Man, I don't even like to fly
I just gotta see her with the sun
Shinin' on her in the water
Chrome aviators on her eyes
I never had a reason to get away
I never had a reason to see this place
She gave me a reason to love L.A


I can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
With somebody twice your size
I been known to cause a few break ups
I been known to cause a few births
I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work


And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars lots of big money
And helping white people dance
I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol
Alcohol


I got blamed at your wedding reception
For your best man's embarrassing speech
And also for those
Naked pictures of you at the beach
I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemmingway write like he did
And I'll bet you a drink or two that I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head


Cause since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux France
Been making a fool out of folks just like you
And helping white people dance
I'm medicine and I am poison
I can help you up or make you fall
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol
Alcohol




I've got a pounding in my chest, baby
Feels like I'm 17 again
Have something burning a hole in my pocket lately
Done asked your daddy, done told your friends


I ain't gettin' down on one knee
Girl, I'm gettin' on two
Might be over the top
But I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do


I'll put a ring on every finger
Just to show you I'm legit
Go on try my last name on girl
Just to see if it fits
If I could baby I would
Marry you a million times
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show the whole world that you're mine
Show the whole world that you're mine


Oh senorita, can't nothing be sweeter
Than you in that white wedding dress
Leaving that church in the limousine
Girl, why you crying, it ain't rocket science
All you gotta do is say yes
Spend the rest of your life with me girl


Don't you know that
I ain't gettin' down on one knee
Girl, I'm gettin' on two
Might be over the top
But I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do


I'll put a ring on every finger
Just to show you I'm legit
Go on try my last name on girl
Just to see if it fits
If I could baby I would
Marry you a million times
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show the whole world that you're mine
Show the whole world that you're mine


Come on
Let's spend this life together
Dropping f-bombs like forever
With the whole world as a witness
Gonna flip that Ms. to Mrs

Takin' a dip on the Sunset Strip in the mornin'
Ain't nothin' like the smell of tofu and high dollar wine
Except maybe all of them cars lockin' down the I-5
I find it amazin', these rats I've been chasin', are helpin' me remember a time


When the only L.A. I knew
Was lower Alabama
Back when me and Hannah
Was wishin' on a southern star
Now it's so complicated, I really hate it
Why'd I ever wanna go so far?
Takin' depression pills in the Hollywood Hills
Actin' like I'm playin' the part


All this grippin' an' grinnin', an' bluesin' an' winnin' an' runnin'
And promises break like an egg on the hot asphalt
What the hell was I thinkin', drinkin' like I'd never get caught?
These high dollar women and the fame and the fortune, ain't worth the ticket I bought


When the only LA I knew
Was lower Alabama
Back when me and Hannah
Was wishin' on a southern star
Now it's so complicated, I really hate it
Why'd I ever wanna go so far?
Takin' depression pills in the Hollywood Hills
Actin' like I'm playin' the part


Takin' depression pills in the Hollywood Hills
Actin' like I'm playin' the part


What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl, what you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink
Some, make it 707
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling out the top
And we'll go...


Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight


Slow country from a cover band
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want, we could grab a cab
Girl, we got all night, I got a bottomless tab
So let's go...


Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight


It feels too good to let it end right here
I ain't going home alone tonight
(So, let's not let it end, let it end right here)
Girl, you're going home with me
So let's go...


Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight


(No, I ain't going home alone tonight)
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight
(Baby, don't let me go home alone )
Home alone tonight


She's up before the sun, on the run
Another dollar, another day, another cup of coffee
Thank you Lord for giving me one more
She still leans on her dreams but it seems
Sometimes she's the only one who still believes
That life is hard, so she takes it on with an American heart.


And it beats like a drum down in New Orleans.
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds, it scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you can't break an American heart


From the small town Friday night lights
To the Broadway neon burning up bright
We're all the same and it's in our veins
A spirit that you can't keep down
A fire inside that'll never burn out
If you are the owner of an American Heart


Cause it beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds, it scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you can't break an American heart


And it beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds, it scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you can't break
You can't break an American heart
An American heart
An American heart


God Bless America
Land of the free
God Bless America

Three or four miles down a red dirt road
Lived a green-eyed girl, I used to go to see her
I'd pull up the drive and she'd jump in
And we'd head off down around the bend to the river

Find a perfect spot and throw a blanket on the ground
Sit there talkin' till the sun went down, about nothing
Then one hot day in June, the clouds rolled in right out of the blue
As we ran for cover, I could smell her perfume and that

Sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Oh, that sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

We were jumpin' and runnin' and laughin' out loud
The sky opened up like the bottom fell out of Heaven, yeah
We dove in the car, turned the radio on
Sat there soakin', singing along with Elton, Bennie and the Jets

She turned and looked my way
Those raindrops slowly runnin' down on her face
I reached out and kissed her
Well, I remember that taste of that

Sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Oh, that sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Sweet summer rain
It keeps blowin' through my mind
Even after all this time
I can't forget that moment, yeah we were falling just like that

Sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Yeah, that sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Oh that sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Yeah, that sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)
I still remember
Sweet rain fallin' down on us


No rush though I need your touch
I won't rush your heart
Until you feel on solid ground
Until your strength is found, girl


I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one


Somebody else was here before
He treated you unkind
And broken wings need time to heal
Before a heart can fly, girl


I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one


Trust in me and you'll find a heart so true
All I want to do is give the best of me to you
And stand beside you
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm "the one"


I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one

Next to Lousiana on the Texas side
There's a little country joint where they let it ride
There's a boogie woogie man on the piano
An' all the backwoods boppers shoutin': "Go cat, go."

They've never been afraid of the Boogie Man
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans
Where that rhythm all began
So don't you
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man

Grandpa's in the corner in his fishing clothes
Reelin' to the rhythm everywhere it goes
All the boogie woogie babies tearing up the floor
When they get a little bit, they want a little more

They've never been afraid of the Boogie Man
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans
Where that rhythm all began
So don't you
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man

--- Instrumental ---

In a red El Dorado, at the break of day
That Boogie Woogie man'll be slipping away
Although you're never gonna know it when he's out of sight
He'll shut a juke box down again tomorrow night

He's never been afraid of the Boogie Man
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans
Where that rhythm all began
It works for me, it'll work for you
He'll have you doin' things that you didn't know you knew
So don't you
Don't you be afraid
No, don't ya
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man, no...


Down a back road
Long, hot summer
A couple kids runnin' loose and wild
He kissed her
She said mister
Take an inch and I'll give you a mile
I ain't here to do anything half-way
Don't give a damn what anyone might say
I just wanna free fall for a while


That rebel moon is shinin'
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasin' down that crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me runnin' baby
Wild at heart


About midnight, he tells her
I ain't got no come-on lines
Well I'll love you, or I'll try to
We got nothing to lose but time
Stick your hand into my back pocket
Light me up like a bottle rocket
I just wanna free fall for a while


That rebel moon is shinin'
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasin' down that crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me runnin' baby
Wild at heart


O-oh, alright
Tonight is tellin' us we're way too young
O-oh, that's alright
I've got forever on the tip of my tongue


That rebel moon is shinin'
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasin' down that crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me runnin' baby
Wild at heart


That rebel moon is shinin'
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasin' down that crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me runnin' baby
You got me runnin' baby
Wild at heart


O-oh, alright


In the desert they’re hanging Christmas lights
From a cactus Christmas tree
And all the way over the sea
In Tokyo, they’re hanging mistletoe


And way down south in Mexico
They’re singing Feliz Navidad
And over in Leningrad
Where the white lights glow
They’re dancing in the snow


And the bells, the bells
The bells are ringing
The joy, the joy, the joy
They’re bringing
For every boy and girl
It’s Christmas time, all over the world


From Romania to Pennsylvania
They’re watching for that sleigh
Over in China Town
Someone saw him flying round
You know they can hardly wait
You might say Joyeux Noël
You might say Buon Natale
It won’t make a difference to me
No matter where you are
It’s gonna warm your heart


When the bells, the bells
The bells are ringing
The joy, the joy
The joy they’re bringing
The bells, the bells
The bells are ringing
For every boy and girl


Yeah the bells, the bells
The joy, the joy
For every boy and girl
It’s Christmas time, all over the world
All over the world


You swept me off my feet from the moment I met you
Thought I was so lucky baby I let you
Into my heart, into my heart
When you started messing 'round
Boy I was blind sighted
Never saw the real you
You were just hiding
Your lies in the dark
But now I see who you are


Boy I'm gonna stop you
Before you get a chance to
Break another heart


I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all about you
Gonna all know what your name is
All over this town
I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all the whole truth
Don't you know what goes around comes around


Yeah I'm gonna make you famous, famous
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah I'm gonna make you famous, famous
Oh oh oh oh


When you walk in the bar
Everyone'll stop talking
Know who you are
You can hear a pin dropping
They're gonna stare
They'll know you everywhere


Boy I'm gonna stop you
Before you get a chance to
Break another heart


Yeah I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all about you
Gonna all know what your name is
All over this town
I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all the whole truth
Don't you know what goes around comes around


Yeah I'm gonna make you famous, famous
Oh oh oh oh
I'm gonna make you famous, famous
Oh oh oh oh


I'm gonna make you wish you never lied to me
Wish you never tried to be somebody that you ain't
I'm gonna make you think before you cheat again
On anyone like me again


I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all about you
Gonna all know what your name is
All over this town
I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all the whole truth
Don't you know what goes around comes around


Yeah I'm gonna make you famous, famous
Oh oh oh oh
I'm gonna make you famous, famous
Oh oh oh oh
I'm gonna make you famous, famous
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah I'm gonna make you famous, famous
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah I'm gonna make you

Time passes by so quickly
But I guess I thought you'd be here forever
I never even had the chance
To say goodbye
There's so many things to tell you
Left unsaid until now

Can you hear me when I talk to you
Do the words I say ever make it through
Can you hear me when I talk to you
Cause I'd give anything if I just knew

Every night I have the same dream
The one where you get to hug me
We laugh an' talk until the morning
An' then you vanish
It always leaves me feeling helpless
When I wake up an' you're not there

Can you hear me when I talk to you
Do you know how much I'd love to be with you
Can you hear me when I talk to you
Cause I'd give anything if I just knew

Living in this world without you
I constantly search through my mem'ries
Hoping that I find some treasures
That I passed over
All that I took for granted
Means so much now an' I won't let it go

Can you hear me when I talk to you
Cause I never said somer things that I meant to
Can you hear me when I talk to you
Cause I'd give anything if I just knew

You know I never said some things that I meant to
Can you hear me when I talk to you
Cause I'd give anything if I just knew

I miss you Daddy

I wonder where your heart is
Cause it sure don't feel like it's here
Sometimes I think you wish
That I would just disappear
Have I got it all wrong
Have you felt this way long
Are you already gone

Do you feel lonely
When you're here by my side
Does the sound of freedom
Echo in your mind
Do you wish you were by yourself
Or that I was someone else
Anyone else

(Chorus)
Where would you be
If you weren't here with me
Where would you go
If you were single and free
Who would you love
Would it be me
Where would you be

I don't wanna hold you back
No, I don't wanna slow you down
I don't wanna make you feel
Like you are tied up and bound
Cause that's not what love's about
If there's no chance we can work it out
Tell me now
Oh tell me tell me now

(Repeat Chorus)
Have I become the enemy
Is it hard to be yourself
In my company

(Repeat Chorus)
Oh tell me tell me now
Where would you be
Where would you go
Who would you love
Would it be me?


I barely know you, you barely know me
We ain't but two slow dances into this thing
Come on and sit down, I'll order us a round
I want to know everything


Girl where's your hometown
Are those your momma's eyes
What are you doing
For the rest of your life


'Cause I'm already thinking about you and me
Getting out of here and taking a drive
Just slide a little closer
Put your head on my shoulder
Like this ain't our first time
Girl don't worry 'bout holding on tight
'Cause I'm already callin'
I'm already callin' you mine
Whoa whoa


I know that there's a chance
I'm thinking too fast
Tell me, tell me am I right
Or am I reading this wrong
They'll play the last song
The lights will come on
That don't mean we can't take
The long way home, home, home


'Cause I'm already thinking about you and me
Getting out of here and taking a drive
Just slide a little closer
Put your head on my shoulder
Like this ain't our first time
Girl don't worry 'bout holding on tight
'Cause I'm already callin'
I'm already callin' you mine


If you like the way that sounds
We can leave this place right now, right now


'Cause I'm already thinking about you and me
Getting out of here and taking a drive
Just slide a little closer
Put your head on my shoulder
Like this ain't our first time
Girl don't worry 'bout holding on tight
'Cause I'm already callin'
I'm already callin' you mine
Whoa Whoa
I'm already callin' you mine
Whoa whoa

An empty room a broken fairy tale
A hollow girl with empty arms
From an angels tears God made the stars
Why can't He make me an unbreakable heart

In my blue world
You shone like Heaven's fire
And left me crying in the dark
How could anyone be so hard
Did you think I had an unbreakable heart

I suppose I should know
Sometimes love just comes and goes
But I believed foolish me
We'd go on and on

One day someone will come to you
And rock you tightly in her arms
Please remember this
When you drop your guard
Nobody has an unbreakable heart

From an angels wings
To a fallen star
God makes everything
But unbreakable hearts

(Gary Burr/Steve Wilkinson)

It hits when I set the table
Or when I turn out the lights
And I don't hear a voice
That whispers goodnight
It hits when I'm in the backyard
And the summer sky smells like rain
Small things like that
Make memories come back again

Shame on me
For kissing you with my eyes closed
And telling myself I had so much time
Losing you never crossed my mind
Shame on me
It thought the way that it was
Was how it would always be
To love someone so carelessly
Shame on me

I'm taking more time for sunsets
And the sound of the birds at dawn
'Cause I know how it feels
To miss what's gone
It hits when I'm out with old friends
And I hear them speak your name
Oh how I wish
There was somebody else to blame

Shame on me
For kissing you with my eyes closed
And telling myself I had so much time
Losing you never crossed my mind
Shame on me
It thought the way that it was
Was how it would always be
To love someone so carelessly
Shame on me


She looks so pretty with no makeup on
You should hear her talking to her mama on the phone
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song
That's my girl
Man, her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl


Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wish that you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl



Every night when she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thanks the Lord for another day
I just thank Him for my girl


Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wish that you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh, my girl


Yeah, that's my girl
In my truck, in the songs that I sing with the radio up
My girl
In my heart, in my soul and the air that I breathe every day
That's my girl
Yeah, everything
My girl


That's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wish that you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh, my girl
Yeah, that's my girl

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight

I wanna be a castaway
And leave the world behind
Take a tropic holiday
Say goodbye to keeping time
Wasting away down by the coast
Pacifico and chasing lime
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight

I’m in an island state of mind
Don’t think I’m ever gonna leave
I’d rather stay and watch the waves
Move the sand beneath my feet
Reggae on the radio
Laying low and feeling high
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
Castaway


Castaway
Ride the waves like we’re young
‘Cause time flies by and soon we’ll be older
It’s better to live in the moment
Than stuck in the past
Fast asleep as the world passes by

Ay ay yo
Where reality is history
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me
Ay ay yo
The good times are free and
Nobody can take that away
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me

Pour me another one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in)
Just like the other one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sunshine in)

Pour me another one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in)
Just like the other one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway, castaway
Gonna let the sunshine in)
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight)

You're telling me
We gotta talk
That you can't go on
Holdin' it inside
No it isn't
Anybody's fault
I shouldn't blame myself
You know I tried
You thought it through
How you agonized
Though it took some time
Now you know for sure
What we have really isn't what
You're looking for

Say no more
Baby I get the picture
Say no more
'Cause I'll never understand
How you fell out of love
But you spelled it out enough
I'll be ok
And you'll be ok
Please walk away
And say no more

No it really doesn't
Ease the pain
When you say you wish
It had all worked out
And being sorry
Isn't gonna change
What I'm losing here
What I'm feeling now
There'll be nights
When I toss and turn
With your hollow words
Ringing in my ears
I think I heard enough to hurt about
You made it clear

Say no more
Baby I get the picture
Say no more
'Cause I'll never understand
How you fell out of love
But you spelled it out enough
I'll be ok
And you'll be ok
Please walk away
And say no more

No one thought that I'd jump off that rocky ledge
So I did, and I broke my leg
And I let Jim beam tell me I could take some guy
Twice my size, but old Jim lied
I can't pretend that I ain't been my life's own wrecking crew
And I'm surprised that I've survived all I put myself through

Before I knew better, before I woke up
I did a whole lotta crazy foolish things I'm not proud of
It was just like me to risk it all
Even when the pain outweighed the pleasure
Before I knew better

You were the first to ever make me wanna change
My reckless ways and I almost did
But somehow I lost track and wound up giving in
To the late night life and the good time friends
You swore to me one day you'd leave and all I had to say
Was there's the door what you waiting for
And who need you anyway

Before I knew better, before I woke up
I said a whole lotta crazy foolish things I'm not proud of
It was just like me to risk it all
Even when the pain outweighed the pleasure
Before I knew better

Girl I pray somehow, someway
We can turn this thing around
I thought your love was something
I could live without, before I knew

Before I knew better, before I woke up
I said a whole lotta crazy foolish things I'm not proud of
It was just like me to risk it all
Even when the pain outweighed the pleasure
Before I knew better, before I knew better
Before I knew better, before I knew better


I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires


Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue


And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something ya'll don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talking, man, ya'll ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missing


I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires


I sit back and think about them good ole days
The way we were raised, and our southern ways
And we like cornbread, and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take ya'll where ya need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods


We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good, and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends


I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires

I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires
That's right

You can't mix Angels and Alcohol
I don't think God meant for them to get along
When it takes control you can't love no one at all
You can't mix Angels and Alcohol

You can't blend whiskey with a good women's love
They don't go together, loves already hard enough
You think you can handle how it feels or what it does
You can't blend whiskey with a good women's love

You can't chase lonely with a bottle of wine
It might ease the heartache for one short piece of time
In the end you have to face what's hiding in your mind
You can't chase lonely with a bottle of wine

You can't mix Angels and Alcohol
An angel once loved me and I traded it all
I let the bottle drive my life into a wall
You can't mix Angels and Alcohol


Damn, I used to love this view
Sit here and drink a few
Main street and the high school lit up on Friday night
Down there it's another touchdown
Man, this year's team is stout
I can hear them going crazy
And up here so am I
Thinking about you sitting there saying I hate this, I hate it
If you couldn't stand living here why'd you take it, take it


Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown


All the colors of my youth
The red, the green, the hope, the truth
Are beating me black and blue cause you're in every scene
My friends try to cheer me up, get together at the Pizza Hut
I didn't have the heart to tell them that was our place
These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street
Shed a light on everything that used to be


Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah


You can have my grandma's locket
The knife out of my grandpa's pocket
Yeah my state champion jacket
I don't care you can have it
Every made memory
Every picture, every broken dream
Yeah everything, everything, everything


Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

All my frien's are asking me where I plan to spend the holidays
People seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways
Some go where the weather's freezing cold while others like it warm
I don't care about the weather just whether I spend Christmas in your arms

We could drive up to the mountains, build a fire and watch it snow
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow

I'd be happy in the city, I'd be happy on the farm
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms
It was only last December I had no Christmas spirit in my heart
My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart
But now you're here beside me, no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree
And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me

We could drive up to the mountains, build a fire and watch it snow
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow

I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms

That backwood town in my rear view
Was gonna be my whole world
Till my factory job got shipped to Mexico
An' my farm boy chased a city girl

I used to know everybody by name
But everybody's moved away
Can't say that I'm really wantin' to go
But I've run out of reasons to stay

This ain't nothin' like
What I had in mind for me
But then again, the future
Ain't what it used to be

I thought like my mom and her momma before
That I would die where I was born
Live a small town dream in a big backyard
Raisin' babies an' corn

Now here I am, one eye on the road
Tryin' to read the map on the dash
Nowhere close to makin' up my mind
With a fork in the road comin' fast

This ain't nothin' like
What I had in mind for me
But then again, the future
Ain't what it used to be

No, this ain't nothin' like
What I had in mind for me
But then again, the future now
Ain't what it used to be

That backwood town in my rear view
Was gonna be my whole world

(Gordon Bradberry/Michael Lunn)

I used to kiss Maxine through the front door screen
Standin' on her mama's steps
And if her daddy hadn't come along and run me off
I know I'd have never left
It's a cryin' shame but that's they way it was
Something always there to separate us

Well I tried not to let it show
But everyone seemed to know
There's something between
Me and Maxine

She used to wave at me from across the street
Through her bedroom window every night
She was almost close enough for me to touch
But I still couldn't hold her tight
That's how it's been right from the start
Always something there to keep us apart

Well I tried not to let it show
But everyone seemed to know
There's something between
Me and Maxine
There's something between
Me and Maxine

All the things that came between us
Couldn't change a thing
Now we're together
And that's how we're gonna stay
'Cause our love just grows
A little more with every day

No I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause in my heart I know
There's something between
Oh I just want to hold her close
'Cause in my heart I know
There's something between
There's something between
There's something between
Me and Maxine
Me and Maxine
I know I know there's somethin'
Somethin' between
I know I know there's somethin'
Somethin' between
Me and Maxine
Somethin' between
Me and Maxine


Some days it's tough just getting up
Throwing on these boots and making that climb
Some days I would rather be a no show or lay low
'Fore I go out of my mind


But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby


Some nights I come home fighting mad
Feel like running my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fighting for anymore
Feeling torn, aw, to hell with it all


But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby


Everything gonna be alright
Just lay down by my side
Let me love you through this life


Yeah, she's a perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Something I can believe in, a best friend
A heaven sent love to lean on


But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby


Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy

I guess we guess our way through life
How many times do we really know for sure
I was just hoping for the best
Then i woke up in those loving arms of yours
What i felt was unmistakable
When i fell for you
Chorus!
It was real, it was magic
It was calm, it was savage
It was cool as a breeze it was warm to the touch
It was never enough, it was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how i knew it was

Who thought that i could laugh so loud
Then turn around and cry so many tears?
I used to have so many doubts
But one by one you made them disappear
But what i found was unbelievable, i believe it's true

Chorus
It was real, it was magic
It was calm it was savage
It was cool as a breeze, it was warm to the touch
It was never enough, it was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how i knew it was

You asked what i felt when you walked through the door
Was it fear, was it clear, it was all that and more

Chorus
It was real, it was magic
It was calm, it was savage
It was cool as a breeze it was warm to the touch
It was never enough, it was always too much
It did all the things love does
And that's how i knew it was
That's how i knew it was
It was

Mmmhmmm, it was


The wheels are turning in my mind
Don't wanna leave, but I might this time
Seconds from whispering goodbye
Yeah the wheels are turning in my mind


If all that's left to do is walk away
Then, baby, I'm as gone as yesterday
But if there's something you still need to say
You need to say it now, hurry up and slow me down
Slow me down


If you let this train roll down these tracks
Gonna wish you tried to talk me back
Boy, you're gonna miss everything we had
If you let this train roll down these tracks


If all that's left to do is walk away
Then, baby, I'm as gone as yesterday
But if there's something you still need to say
You need to say it now, hurry up and slow me down
Slow me down


The wheels are turning in my mind
Don't wanna leave, but I might this time


If all that's left to do is walk away
Then, baby, I'm as gone as yesterday
But if there's something you still need to say
You need to say it now, hurry up and slow me down
Slow me down


Slow me down
Slow me down

Sometimes I feel like I need
To shake myself
To wake myself
I feel like I'm just sleepwalkin'
Through my life
It's like I'm swimmin' in
An ocean of emotion
But still somehow slowly
Goin' numb inside
I don't like who I'm becomin'
I know I've gotta do somethin'
Before my life passes right by
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
Sometimes I wonder
Why I work so hard to guard
My heart
Till I hardly feel anything at all
I've spent my whole life building
Up this ivory tower
And now that I'm in it, I keep
Wishin' it would fall
So I could feel the ground
Beneath me
Really taste this air I'm
Breathin'
And know that I'm alive
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
Somethin' deep inside
Keeps sayin'
Life is like a vapor
It's gone in just the
Twinklin' of an eye
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
I want to take every
Breath I can get
I want to live
Yeah, yeah


Hey old friend, thanks for callin'
It's good to know somebody cares
Yeah she's gone, but I don't feel like talkin'
It might be just too much to bear
To hear somebody say it stops hurting
Or to hear somebody say she ain't worth it


'Cause you don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do


I can't forget, I'm drowning in these memories
It fills my soul with all the little things
And I can't cope, it's like a death inside the family
It's like she stole my way to breathe
So don't try to tell me I'll stop hurting
Don't try to tell me she ain't worth it


'Cause you don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do

'Cause you don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do


Not like I do
Never understand
That girl's my best friend
That girl's my best friend
That girl's my best friend

I feel a sin comin' on
I feel a right that's about to go wrong
I got a shiver down to the bone
I feel a sin comin' on

I gotta buzz in my brain
Drunk on a love goin' down like champagne
I got a feelin' it's gonna leave a lipstick stain
And I'd be the only one to blame

And you can see it
All over my face
Sweet temptation
All over the place
Give me tall dark and handsome
Mix it up with something strong
I feel a sin (I feel a sin) comin' on

Please Jesus don't hold me back
I know it ain't mine but I want it so bad
The smoke and the whiskey's
Got me feeling easy
And lights are all fading to black

And you can see it
All over my face
Sweet temptation
All over the place
Give me tall dark and handsome
Mix it up with something strong
I feel a sin (I feel a sin) comin' on

And you can see it (and you can see it)
All over my face (all over my face)
Sweet temptation
All over the place
Give me tall dark and handsome
Mix it up with something strong
I feel a sin (I feel a sin) comin' on
I feel a sin (I feel a sin) comin' on

There in the pale moonlight
That's where you and I were walking
I said, looking in your eyes
I'm feeling like the sky is falling
You said, you gotta be free
But love like this is everlasting
I said, I gotta be me
But I move my feet and nothing happens
True love is a funny thing
'Cause no one else does what you do to me
I'm chasing my tail, spinning my wheels
I got your heart, hot on my heels
I'm all dressed up but I swear
Without your love, I'm going nowhere
Fast or slow
You can say, I told you so
I've done that've been there
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
Time, I've got a lot of that
Day and night baby, I been thinking
How soon do I want you back
Sooner than you can say, you need me
True love is a funny thing
'Cause no one else does what you do to me
I'm chasing my tail, spinning my wheels
I got your heart, hot on my heels
I'm all dressed up but I swear
Without your love, I'm going nowhere
Fast or slow
You can say, I told you so
I've done that''ve been there
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
Oh, what you do to me
Now, I just can't get away from what used to be
Your love is all, I can dream about
Oh baby, you got my head spinning 'round, yeah
I'm chasing my tail, spinning my wheels
I got your heart, hot on my heels
I'm all dressed up but I swear
Without your love, I'm going nowhere
Fast or slow
You can say, I told you so
I've done that've been there
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
I'm chasing my tail, spinning my wheels
I got your heart, hot on my heels
I'm all dressed up but I swear
Without your love, I'm going nowhere
Fast or slow
You can say, I told you so
I've done that''ve been there
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
But without your love, I'm going nowhere
But without your love, I'm going nowhere

Met a man wearin' a t-shirt, says "Virginia is for lovers"
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said "All you're really given is the sunshine and your name"
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain


Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along


Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?


Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along


Find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to


Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along


Sometimes you gotta drink about somebody
But that ain't goin' bring 'em back
Sometimes you gotta cry and miss somebody
Yea, we've all felt like that
If it's something that you gotta get over, but you just can't get over


Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishing you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you


Sometimes you try to fix somebody
Just to find out they’ll never change
So you go out and meet somebody
That makes you feel the way you thought you’d never feel again


Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you’re wishin’ you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
Yeah (Yeah)


Oh, girl loses boy, the best remedy is
Girl meets boy, girl don’t make it harder than it has to be
Come and lay one on me
Hmm hmm
You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
Yeah I know what you’re goin’ through, I do


So come on and kiss somebody
In the back of the cab or on the subway train
Come on and kiss somebody
On the midnight street in the summer rain
If you’re wishin’ you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closing time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
I wanna kiss somebody

The sign in the window said for sale or trade
On the last remaining dinosaur Detroit made
Seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal
For a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels

And that road rolls out like a welcome mat
I don't know where it goes but it beats where we're at
We always said someday,somehow
We were gonna get away, gonna blow this town

What about now,how 'bout tonight
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now,why should we wait
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now

We've been puttin' this off baby long enough
Just give me the word,and we'll be kickin' up dust
We both know it's just a matter of time
'Til our hearts start racin' for that county line

What about now,how 'bout tonight
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now,why should we wait
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now

We could hang around this town forever making plans
But there won't ever be a better time to take this chance

What about now,how 'bout tonight
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now,why should we wait
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now

Yeah! Oh!
What about noooooow


I got me a brand new car
Waiting in the driveway
Shining like a bright new star
I've been wishing on it every day
To take me away from here


So I called in to where I work
Told a little white lie
No, my back don't really hurt
But that's my alibi
My temporary ticket to anywhere but there


Call it an early weekend
Call it going off the deep end
Call it what you want
I made up my mind


I don't have to be me 'til Monday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday
I ain't gonna face reality
Three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of goin' non-stop
No work and all play
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
Yeah


I can do what I wanna do
Be who I wanna be
I got no one to answer to
Soon as I turn the key
A cash machine, gasoline, and we're outta here


Call it an early weekend
Call it going off the deep end
Baby, you and me
We can leave it all behind


'Cause I don't have to be me 'til Monday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday
I ain't gonna face reality
Three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of going non-stop
No work and all play
I don't have to be me 'til Monday


Oh, three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of going non-stop
No work and all play
I don't have to be me 'til Monday


(I don't have to be me)
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
(I don't have to be me)
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
(I don't have to be me)
I don't have to be me 'til Monday


Grew up on a tightrope, learned to smile
Even when i was falling down
Daddy had a hard hand and mama always had hope
And me and my sister couldn't wait to get out
Fell in love out of college
Good man but a bad year
Visions of sugarplums and boxes of roses
All my girlfriends cried and i was outta here


Oh, whoa, everybody's dreaming big
Oh, whoa, but everybody's just getting by
That's how it goes in everyday america
A little town and a great big life


Joey stares at a trophy
Took us all the way to state back in '85
A shining moment and a dusty reminder
He never felt so scared, he never felt so alive
Now there's toys in the backyard
Daddy's boys, yeah, you know how they like to fight
When they sleep, he swears they're angels
He wouldn't trade a day for all those friday nights




We can laugh, we can cry
We're all just looking for the reasons why
In a place of dark can we see the light
Either way it'll be alright




Oh, whoa, everybody's dreaming big
Oh, whoa, but everybody's just getting by
That's how it goes in everyday america
A little town and a great big life
A little town and a great big life
A little town and a great big life


What gives you courage to walk up to a ten in a bar
What turns the nervous into a rock star
What gets you through the week then
And right on through the weekend
And puts you back together again


Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Going to be mm so good, mm so nice
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip


What makes a good old boy start pumping his fist in the sky
What makes a shy girl walk on the wild side
What makes a party better
Makes it last forever
Everybody all together now


Take a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Going to be mm so good, mm so nice
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip


You can chug it down all you want
But you aren’t going to last long
Trust me you can get there with


Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Going to be mm so good, mm so right
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip


Taking one of them big old sips

I came up river on a gravel barge from New Orleans
She was standing on the cobblestones in a pair of cut-off jeans
I asked what she was doin', she said "Sugar, I'm killin' time"
Then I handed her my wallet and said, "Baby, so am I"

{*Whistling*}

She said "You might need these" and then handed me her shades
Took me to a barroom darker than the ace of spades
I asked "What's this we're drinkin'?" She said "Call it smokey Blues"
I couldn't tell you what it tasted like, but I know I had a few...

And we danced and we laughed, never talked about tomorrow
We just lived a little in the here and now
With her hands in my hair, like a million magic fingers
She said "Look me up when you get back to town"
"Look you up," I said, "Hell, I'm gonna hunt you down."
Na na-na-na na na nah, na na na na nah na, hunt you down

She asked where I was comin' from
I said "I'm just comin' round, how 'bout you?"
Then she drove me to the highest hill in Germantown
"My daddy's money bought the mansion, they threw in the plane for free"
She said, "I can drop you off anywhere or you can stay with me"

And we danced and we laughed, never talked about tomorrow
We just lived a little in the here and now
With her hands in my hair, like a million magic fingers
She said "Look me up when you get back to town'
"Look you up," I said, "Hell, I'm gonna hunt you down."
Ooh ooh ooh

Last night I saw a falling star dive straight into the river
And I thought about that girl in Germantown
I've gotta hunt her down

We danced and we laughed, never talked about tomorrow
We just lived a little in the here and now
With her hands in my hair, like a million magic fingers
She said "Look me up when you get back to town"
"Look you up," I said, "Hell, I'm gonna hunt you down."
I'm gonna hunt you down...
Oh oh oh
Na na-na-na na na nah, na na na na nah na, hunt you down

{*Whistling*}


I've been a rolling stone all my life
Flying all alone, flying blind
I've seen it all, I've been around
I've been lost and I've been found but


Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you


I've got a ways to go on this ride
But I got a hand to hold that fits just right
You make me laugh, you make me high
You make me want to hold on tight, cause


Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you


Because of you I'm a lucky man
You're the best part of who I am


Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you

Yes, who I am with you

So your conscience finally hit you
And you're feeling guilty
And you're wishing I was there
So you wanna say you're sorry
Well, please forgive me if I'm too gone to care
You can take back your goodbyes
Wipe off those sad eyes
Cause I've got some tears of my own

Weather man says it's gonna rain tonight
The kind of storm where the basement floods and you lose the lights
Should have thought of that before
Cause I'm not your blue sky anymore

So you heard the pitter-patter of a lost heart beating
And learned what it was for
So you made a list of shoulders that you'd be needing
Well mine aren't yours anymore
Come on show me your temper
Be the man I remember
So I won't forget what you've done

Weather man says it's gonna rain tonight
The kind of storm where the basement floods and you lose the lights
Should have thought of that before
Cause I'm not your blue sky anymore

Don't wanna be that blue sky
I'm not your blue sky anymore


Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way
Love's in the air tonight
You can bet you make this ol' boy's day
Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way


Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance
And the next one after that
Gonna make you mine there's a real good chance
Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance


Hey pretty girl, it feels so right
Just like it's meant to be
All wrapped up in my arms so tight
Hey pretty girl, it feels so right


Life's a long and winding ride
Better have the right one by your side
And happiness don't drag its feet
Time moves faster than you think


Hey pretty girl, wanna take you home
My momma's gonna love you
She'll make me sleep on the couch, I know
Hey pretty girl, wanna take you home


Hey pretty girl, let's build some dreams
And a house on a piece of land
We'll plant some roots and some apple trees
Hey pretty girl, let's build some dreams


Life's a long and winding ride
Better have the right one by your side
And happiness don't drag its feet
Time moves faster than you think


Hey pretty girl, you did so good
Our baby's got your eyes
And a fighter's heart like I knew she would
Hey pretty girl, you did so good


Hey pretty girl, when I see the light
And it's my time to go
I'm gonna thank the Lord for a real good life
A pretty little girl and a beautiful wife


Every morning when you come downstairs
Hair's a mess but I don't care
No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross off finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this


You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy


Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by us so fast


You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy


Oh, I wanna sing it again


You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy


Six beers and five guys and if I remember right, it was a
Wednesday when we got our buzz on for second hand six pack
Half smoked soft pack, light it up boys, take a drag
And when I fought that cough off everyone else thought I was so damn cool


But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah man, it really rocked my world


Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little longer
I can't tell you why they did, but things seemed to never end back then
Oh way back when, when a little went a long way


One girl, 45 bucks was all it took that night
Hit the steakhouse makeout and the movies way up in the back
Credits roll on pace,to make it all the way to second base
Tried to play it cool like it was nothin' new and she didn't have a clue


But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah man, she really rocked my world


Back when things seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little longer
I can't tell you why they did, things seemed to never end back then
Oh way back when, when a little went a long way


Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little longer
I can't tell you why they did, but things seemed to never end back then
Oh way back when, when a little went a long long way
A long way


This is my kinda town, this is my kinda place
I wouldn't mind hangin' 'round for more than just a couple days
I got a 12th floor room with a killer view of the empty Astrodome
Got a tab at the bar downstairs, but all I can think about is home


I got new boots covered in red dirt, a "Don't Mess With Texas" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with "missin' you"
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon, 'cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem


You should've seen 19th Street, you should've seen a midnight rodeo
The way them saloon doors swing, when they line dance to "Copperhead Road"
Something about the air down here, that'll make you feel the way all them cowboys do
I wish I was an outlaw, but all I can think about is you


I got new boots covered in red dirt, a "Don't Mess With Texas" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with "missin' you"
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon, 'cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem


It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon, 'cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem
We got a problem
We got a problem


The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of


Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would


Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show


Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

You say I am your everything:
The half that makes you whole
You say you love me with all your heart
Your body and your soul
You say your love is an ocean
Without any shore
You ask how much I love you:
I love you more

I'd give you my seat on the train to Heaven
If only one of us could go
Give every ounce of blood in my body
If no pain you'd ever know
Oh, I'd fight every evil
That ever came against our door
I know much you love me
But I love you more

Wakin' up with you in the mornin'
Is seein' your smilin' face
Makes me feel like God
Has put us in a permanent state of grace
Your kiss tells me you need me
Like nobody has before
You say how much you want me:
I want you...

More, with every day that goes by;
(More.)
When I hold you every night
Our love will last till the end of time
Then, baby, we'll find even more

I'd give you my seat on the train to Heaven
If only one of us could go
Give every ounce of blood in my body
If no pain you'd ever know
Oh, I'd fight every evil
That ever came against our door
I know much you love me
I love you more

I know much you love me
But I love you more

The house stood on the outskirts of an old ghost town
I brushed aside the cobwebs, walked in and looked around
I found a dusty diary beside a worn out bed
Dated 1882 and this is what it said

This town has seven blacksmiths, twenty-five saloons
Thirty-seven churches, and two-hundred hotel rooms
More Longhorn Texas cattle than I have ever seen
And the finest little cathouse this side of New Orleans

In the House of Negotiable Affections
Every cowboy is as special as the next one
All the ladies are so lovely with their painted on complexions
At the House of Negotiable Affections

From Kansas down to Texas is a long and tiresome course
And a cowboy needs more comfort than sidekick and a horse
So he'll climb that spiral staircase to a dim lit little room
Where he'll touch those red silk stockings and smell that sweet perfume

In the House of Negotiable Affections
There's Kansans and Nebraskans and there's Texans
Lookin' up at the ceilin', laughin' at their own reflections
In the House of Negotiable Affections

I closed that dusty diary and laid it on the shelf
Then all at once the bedsprings started squeakin' by themselves
When I saw her ghostly figure, I nearly died of fright
She said for half a dollar you can stay with me all night

At the House of Negotiable Affections
She was wearin' nothin' but a pale complexion
I guess you might say I made a spiritual connection
At the House of Negotiable Affections

There's a few old cowboy bones, but mostly ghostly apparitions
In the House of Negotiable Affections

There's a front row scarecrow peekin' through Hogan's crops
There's a Trans-Am cute thing taking off her t-tops
There's a whole lot of honeys and they make a sweet backdrop
To a sunset banjo tunin' up to rock

Hey baby, wanna make a little music
Pull out your twang and show me how you use it (Oh oh oh)
C'mon

Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
It'll do you good to let loose a little
Let me hear you scream right there in the middle (Oh oh oh)
Holler if you're with me

We're all free-fallin' in this field of country love
It's a head-bobbin' hand waving' sea of solo cups
Sweat drops rollin' off, mixin' in the moonshine mud
From all of the bumping and grinding, I just can't' get enough
Oh, can't you get enough?

Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
It'll do you good to let loose a little
Let me hear you scream right there in the middle (Oh oh oh)
Holler if you're with me

Holler if you're with me
I said, holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me, c'mon
Holler if you're with me

Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
It'll do you good to let loose a little
Let me hear you scream right there in the middle (Oh oh oh)
Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me

Holler if you're with me


She got her daddy's tongue and temper
Sometimes her mouth could use a filter
God shook his head the day he built her
Oh, but I bet he smiled
She loves and lives her life, unruly
Tears up that dirt road up in a dually
Dangerous, absolutely
And in a little while
She'll be rounding that corner on three wheels
Ain't slowing down, yelling, "Come on, jump in"
Always up to something, crazy, got nothing on her


She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
But she's just right for me


She says she wants to meet my momma
I said, "I don't think you ought a
Be like mixing oil and water"
But by midnight, she had
Momma on the coffee table, dancing
Coming unwound
Good God, I swear, can't take her anywhere
What's the girl going to do next?


She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
But she's just right for me


Every once in a while, she gives me that smile
And says, "I just don't see somebody like you
Loving somebody like me"


She ain't right
Oh, She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
She's just right
She's just right
She's just right for me
She's just right
She's just right
She ain't right
She's just right for me


I want to walk that line a little crooked
And live my life a little on the rocks
Laugh at every time I fail
Not afraid to make a fool of myself
And keep on dancing when the music stops


Because I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high, leaning on your shoulder
Sweeter like a wine as it gets older
When I die I don't want to go sober
Oh, when I die, I don't want to go sober


You're like drinking from a never-ending bottle
When I think it's gone there's always a little more left
Lay back with you and close my eyes
Let the big old world just spin on by
And saying your name with my last breath

(x3)


Oh, when I die, I don't want to go sober
Oh, when I die, I don't want to go sober

Sleigh bells ringing
Quire singing
Wondering what ole Santa's bringing
It's the warm and fuzzy time of year

Snow flakes fall
The temp is dropping
Families out together shopping
It's the warm and fuzzy time of year

Elves are working over time
Making all our toys
Reindeer hooves on all the roofs
Good little girls and boys
Big old cups of steaming cider
Fall asleep by the cozy fire
It's the warm and fuzzy time of year

Elves are working over time
Making all our toys
Reindeer hooves on all the rooves
Good little girls and boys
Big old cup of steaming cider
Fall asleep by the cozy fire

It's the warm and fuzzy time of year
It's the warm and fuzzy time of year


Stopped to have a few at five now you're crossing that center line for the third time
Second time like this this week had a friend ask you for your keys
You said 'no I'm fine'
You sure do act like you don't got a thing to lose
But every car you pass might be the ones you take with you


You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country for your Jesus for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
You've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothing to die for


So what's the harm in a little fun
'Cause you're off to work before the sun every day
And the inbox outbox locks you in and the money you make ain't worth the time you spend to make your pay
The doctor says 'man your numbers they don't lie'
The graveyard's full of folks that didn't have time to die


You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country for your Jesus for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
You've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothing to die for


Straight through that guardrail up into that white light
You hear a sweet voice saying just this side of the other side
Just this side of the other side


You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country for your Jesus for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
You've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothing to die for


Ain't nothing to die for
Nothing to die for
Ain't nothing to die for


Never knew my old man's truck could even run like that
Should've known better than to take that curve so fast
Daddy pulled up, I was down in a ditch
He asked me why I did what I did


There was this girl, drink in her hand
Shootin' me a "let's get into trouble" grin
I ain't never seen somethin' so fine
And I was doin' anything to make her mine
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl


Some folks ask me why I still pick this guitar
They say livin' that life on the road won't get you very far
I say man you should've been down in Tupelo
Seen what was in the front row


There was this girl, beer in her hand
Shootin' me a "play a little Skynyrd" grin
She's turnin' it up, she's turnin' me on
And I'd play her anything she'd sing along
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl
Yeah there was this girl


Didn't know a diamond ring could cost so much (damn)
Took six months on a farm 'fore I saved up
All my drinkin' buddies still out on the town
Wonderin' why I ever settled down


But there was this girl, holdin' my hand
Shootin' me a "start a life together" grin
She's pullin' me in, she's straightenin' me out
And now I know what love is all about
I'm still out of my mind, she's still out of this world
There was this girl


Yeah, there was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl
There was this girl

I bet you'd never guess who I saw tonight
Guess you didn't see me in those low dim lights
I knew who she was
By the ring still on her hand
Sure looked like you still wanted to be her man

So I guess that means that things are better
Must not be so bad at home
I thought it looked like you were leavin'
But it don't
And I heard you tell her you still love her
So it doesn't matter what you say
I saw it all
From a table away

I thought she was pretty
She's nothing like the things you said
The woman you described
Couldn't even turn your head
The two of you look lost
Inside a world all your own
Like you couldn't wait to get her alone

So I guess that means that things are better
Must not be so bad at home
I thought it looked like you were leavin'
But it don't
And I heard you tell her you still love her
So it doesn't matter what you say
I saw it all
From a table away

And I heard you tell her you still love her
So it doesn't matter what you say
I saw it all
From a table away
Yes you're gonna stay
A table away


There's a melody in my head
And I ain't stopped humming it
Since I saw your face

There's a feeling I can't forget
It started with you
Kissing me that way
And there's no end in sight

Like an Oklahoma wheat field blowin'
You've got my heart in motion
And I'm gone

I'm the pinks
And you're the reds
Just like this sunset
We belong
And there's no end in sight


How high is the sky
How long is time
With you it's how I'm spending mine
Like there is no end in sight

I wanna laugh
I wanna live
I'm gonna love you like there is
Like there is no end in sight


So kick your shoes off
Stay awhile
Ain't nothing here
But stars for miles and me

We're standing on the edge of something
Not afraid of jumpin' in deep
And there's no end in sight



I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you



I'm gonna love you like there is no end in sight
I'm gonna love you like there's no end in sight

There's a melody in my head
And I ain't stop hummin' it
Since I saw your face


1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Hey!


I'm down to my last dollar I've walk right though my shoes
Just a small reminder of the hell that I've gone through
But look at me still smiling as I'm wondering what I'll do
Since I ain’t got nothing I've got nothing to lose
Everybody say "hahaha, hahaha"
My friends are always giving me watches, hats, and wine
That's how I know this is serious that's how I know it's time
I don't have to worry about things that I don't have
'Cause if I ain't got nothing I've got nothing to hold me back


1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you’ve given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away


There's nothing that's worth keeping me
From places I should go
From happy Ville to loving land
I'm going to tour from coast to coast
I'm leaving everything behind
There's not much that I need
'Cause If I ain't got nothing
I'm footloose and fancy free


1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you’ve given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away


Look at me so free
Nothings holding me down (down)
Look at me so free
Can't keep my feet on the ground


1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and


1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, Fly Away, Fly away, Fly away
Fly away!!

Put me on a mountain, way back in the backwoods
Put me on a lake with biggin on the line
Put me 'round a campfire cookin' something I just cleaned
You do your thing, I'll do mine

I ain't tradin' in my family's safety
Just to save on a little gas
And I'll pray to God any place, any time
And you can bet I'll pick up the phone if Uncle Sam calls me up
You do your thing, I'll do mine

Hey, I'll worry about me
You just worry about you
And I'll believe what I believe
And you can believe what you believe too

I ain't gonna spare the rod
Cuz that ain't what my daddy did
And I sure know the difference between wrong and right
You know, to me it's all just common sense
A broken rule, a consequence
You do your thing, I'll do mine

Hey, I'll worry about me
You just worry about you
And I'll believe what I believe
And you can believe what you believe too

I'm gonna keep on working hard
Make my money the old-fashioned way
I don't wanna piece of nobody else's pie
If I don't get my fill on life I ain't gonna blame no one but me
You do your thing, I'll do mine

You ain't gonna be my judge
Cuz my judge will judge us all one day
You do your thing, I'll do mine

(Steve Diamond/Maribeth Derry)

I meant to tell you yesterday
How the sun looked in your hair
And how the light danced in your eyes
As you were standing there
I searched my soul for clever ways to say the words
And though I'm not a poet
There's something you should know

I think you're beautiful
I think you're wonderful
And just looking at you
Takes my breath away
I think you're magical
And when I'm with you girl
If my heart could speak, then you would hear it say
I think you're beautiful, so beautiful

I placed a solitary rose
On your pillow as you sleep
Will you touch it to your lips
Everytime you think of me
I try to show you with these little things I do
That one thing never changes
When it comes to you

I think you're beautiful
And I think you're wonderful
And just looking at you
Takes my breath away
I think you're magical
And when I'm with you girl
If my heart could speak, then you would hear it say
I think you're beautiful, so beautiful girl

Forgive me baby if I stop and stare
But your kind of beauty is so fine and rare
Just let me say what's on my mind
Baby let me tell you one more time

I think you're beautiful
And I think you're wonderful
And just looking at you
Takes my breath away
I think you're magical
And when I'm with you girl
If my heart could speak, then you would hear it say
I think you're beautiful, so beautiful girl

I think you're beautiful....


I work down at the pizza pit
And I drive an old Hyundai
I still live with my mom and dad
I'm 5'3 and overweight


I'm a Sci-Fi fanatic
Mild asthmatic
Never been to 2nd base
But there's a whole nother me
That you need to see
Go check out MySpace


Cause online I'm out in Hollywood
I'm 6'5 and I look damn good
I drive a Maserati
I'm a black belt in Karate
And I love a good glass of wine


It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
I tell 'em I don't want nothing serious
Cause even on a slow day I can have a three way
Chat with two women at one time

I'm so much cooler online
So much cooler online


I get home, I kiss my mom
And she fixes me a snack
I head down to my basement bedroom
And fire up my Mac


In real life the only time I
Ever even been to L.A
Was when I got the chance with the marching band
To play tuba in the Rose Parade


Online I live in Malibu
I posed for Calvin Kline, I've been in GQ
I'm single and I'm rich
And I got a set of six pack abs that'll blow your mind





When you got my kinda stats, it's hard to get a date
Let alone a real girlfriend
But I grow another foot
And I lose a bunch of weight everytime I log in


Online I'm out in Hollywood
I'm 6'5 and I look damn good
Even on a slow day, I can have a three way
Chat with two women at one time


I'm so much cooler online
Yeah I'm cooler online
I'm so much cooler online
Yeah I'm cooler online

Take off those heels, lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins but we don't even care
Candles dripping on your body, baby this ain't truth or dare
Everybody wonders where we run off to
My body on your body baby sticking like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty girl, it's only one or two
The fever's running, feel the heat between us too

I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride
I'm gon ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride
I'm gon ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet

Yeah girl, we can go slow
Yeah, we can go slow

Lay on your back, like you right there
Don't have to say it twice, love, there's nothing here to fear
Taking it back, back to where it's clear
Rolling on and on, sounds of loving in the air

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon' make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet

The sun's coming up, you're on my side
I rub your thigh, you look in my eyes
And I just see the sky, I'm so high
And I ain't smoked yet, I'm just coming down from it

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream

I'm gon ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet


She said, "I'm going out with my girlfriends
Margaritas at the Holiday Inn"
Oh, have mercy, my only thought
Was tequila makes her clothes fall off


I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks Patrón
Her closet's missing half the things she bought
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off


She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink


Them pantyhose ain't gonna last too long
If the DJ puts Bon Jovi on
She might come home in a tablecloth
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off

Whoa


She can handle any champagne brunch
A bridal shower with Bacardi punch
Jello shooters full of Smirnoff
But tequila makes her clothes fall off


She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink


She don't mean nothing
She's just having fun
Tomorrow she'll say, "Oh, what have I done?"
Her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
Yeah, Tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, Tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, Tequila makes her clothes fall off


Red sun sitting on the road behind her
A hundred miles out of her hometown
Drops a quarter in a beat-up payphone
Listens to it rattle on down
Voices cold as the phone she's holding
The connects way too clear
He's yelling, "Where's my dinner?"
She's too far gone to care
She says, "Listen here"


There's a time to stand and the time is now or never
A time to fly, a time to let go forever
A time to grow, and a time to discover
Life is precious, every second
You've wasted mine and it's my time


She puts a few more miles between them
He pours a distance of his own
Starts talking to the bottle
It's all that left now she's gone
He rages on till the National Anthem
Comes on his TV
Then he looks straight at the bottle
And says you did this to me
And then he screams




It's my time, it's my time, it's my time
And the time is what you make it
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time
And time is what you're taking




Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile
Me and Mary making our way into the night
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides
The pinball bells, ski ball slides
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet


And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine


There's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her
We both laugh cause we know it isn't true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you


But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine


Oo, oo


And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Mary I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine


Oo, oo


And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
Hey, I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine


Baby we've been together for a long, long time
You get home from work and then we just turn out the lights
Lately I've been dreaming you in leather, me in lace
Let's put up the teddy bears, and get out the whips and chains


Give me weed instead of roses
Bring me whiskey instead of wine
Every puff, every shot, you're looking better all the time
I don't need a card from Hallmark
Box of candy, heaven knows
Give me weed instead of roses
Let's see where it goes


Honey you don't have to worry
There ain't no one else for me
Lately we have fallen under the same routine
I ain't getting any younger, oh but you don't seem to care
Let's trade in the boxers for some sexy underwear




Let's send the kids to grandma
And call in sick to work
Put on some heavy metal
Rip the phone off of the hook
Go call your no good brother
We both know what he's been growing
I'll be waiting with the whipped cream
And baby let's get going




You pull out the Polaroid
And I'll strike a couple poses
Oh let's get a little wild
Bring me weed instead of roses

Hello, who's askin'?
A bill collector? Well he ain?t here
Ah hell, I guess you got me
Well, mister let me make this perfectly clear

When I get it you?ll get it
Times are tough get in line and wait

Times are tough get in line and wait
When I get it you'll get it
And that?s all you're gettin' today, yeah

On a fifty dollar bet
My buddy just looked at me
And shook his head, and you know what he said

When I get it you'll get it
You better back it on up, and get off my case
When I get it you'll get it
And that?s all you're gettin? today, yeah

Couple cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow
In and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows
She's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup
Take a drunk girl home

She's bouncing like a pinball
Singing every word she never knew
Dancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room
Her hair's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress
Take a drunk girl home


Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home


You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat
They're singing "Closing Time" at that little bar across the street
In two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up
That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off
And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbor’s cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did


Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how ya know the difference between a boy and man
You take a drunk girl home


You took a drunk girl home
In the sober light of dawn
She left you a message she thanks you on the phone
'Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor
You left the hall lights on walked out and locked the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

You take a drunk girl home
Take a drunk girl home

You can buy her flowers and a good champagne
Write her a song on your old six-string
But if you really wanna change the game tonight
Just add moonlight
If you've said everything you wanna say
You're still not sure it's gonna go your way
If you're afraid that her heart's just out of sight
Just add moonlight

Kisses are sweeter and the world seems right
With that big yellow ball shining in her eyes
If you wanna make her fall in love tonight
Just add moonlight

There's a secret all the poets know
There's something special in the way it grows
If you wanna make a love song turn out right
Just add moonlight

Kisses are sweeter and the world seems right
With that big yellow ball shining in her eyes
If you wanna make her fall in love tonight
Just add moonlight

You hold her tighter and the whole world sings
It's that magic moment that's in every girl's dreams
If you wanna make her fall in love tonight
Just add moonlight, oh yeah

You hold her tighter and the whole world sings
It's that magic moment that's in every girl's dreams
You wanna make her fall in love tonight
Just add moonlight

Kisses are sweeter and the world seems right
With that big yellow ball shining in her eyes
If you wanna make her fall in love tonight
Just add moonlight, oh yeah
Just add moonlight, oh yeah
Just add moonlight, oh yeah
Just add moonlight

She hung her halo up
And put her boots on
She got all prettied up
Rockin' in the mirror
To a country song

Girls in the driveway pickin' her up
She can hear that bass drum kickin'
All week long she been bottled up
Like a time bomb ticking

Aw, now look at her go
Sippin' on somethin'
On the way to the show
Flirtin' her way
To the front row

She got her moonlight wild side
Crazy coming out on a Friday night
Straight out of another world
She turns into another girl
You gotta stand back watch her move
One that the band's all singing to
Spin around like a tilt-a-whirl
I can't look at another girl
Another girl

When she's at her 9 to 5
No, she don't say much
She's a little shy tied
Don't ever hear her say much

Oh, if they could see her now
They wouldn't recognize her
Wearing some boys hat she just met
Holding up her beer like a lighter

She got her moonlight wild side
Crazy coming out on a Friday night
Straight out of another world
She turns into another girl
You gotta stand back watch her move
One that the band's all singing to
Spin around like a tilt-a-whirl
Yeah, I can't look at another girl
Another girl

Turns into another girl
There ain't ever been another girl
That can move me like she does
I can't take my eyes off of her

She got her moonlight wild side
Crazy coming out on a Friday night
Straight out of another world
She turns into another girl
You gotta stand back watch her move
One that the band's all singing to
Spin around like a tilt-a-whirl
I can't look at another girl

Yeah, look at her go
She's getting down in the front row
Yeah, do your thang girl

Sometimes, I crave an old-fashioned adventure
Yeah, sometime away from day to day to get ya
Needed some kind of break
Like a hammock in the shade

I've got this spot where it don't get much better
Yeah, it's cold, it gets hot; I don't worry 'bout the weather
My private paradise don't fit the classifieds
Vacation at my side every day and every night

Hawaii's got big breaks; Michigan, Great Lakes;
Colorado snowflakes, Georgia peaches
Louisiana hot food, New York attitude, Florida beaches
Tennessee whiskey; Baby, are you with me?
Texas chili, Virginia pine
It's hard to beat that California sunshine
Baby, you're my favorite
Favorite state of mind

It feels just like I've died and gone to Heaven
Your lips, your eyes, hell everything gets me revvin'
You're fearless and you're fun; thirty flavors all in one
Crazy, happy, laughin' at me, all that and then some

Hawaii's got big breaks; Michigan, Great Lakes;
Colorado snowflakes, Georgia peaches
Louisiana hot food, New York attitude, Florida beaches
Tennessee whiskey; Baby, are you with me?
Texas chili, Virginia pine
It's hard to beat that California sunshine
Baby, you're my favorite
Favorite state of mind

Hawaii's got big breaks; Michigan, Great Lakes;

Baby, you're my favorite
Favorite state of mind, yeah

My favorite state of mind


"Jack and Diane" painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song


I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back


I used to rock all night long to "Keep On Rocking Me Baby"
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song


And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back


We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time


So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now "Only The Good Die Young" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back


I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back, I go back, I go back

If I drink one, I drink a hundred
Try to have a little fun
Might not come in until the sun comes up
I've got a tendency to get carried away
Girl I'm just made that way

So baby forgive me
If I move closer every time that you kiss me
'Cause I ain't ever had a feeling hit me so strong
Girl I might just keep on, lovin' you as long as I live
I don't know when to quit

Your sweet love it's like a habit
Like a real good drug
And I ain't ever gonna get enough
'Cause every day girl it just keeps on getting better
I'm in this thing forever and ever

So baby forgive me
If I move closer every time that you kiss me
'Cause I ain't ever had a feeling hit me so strong
Girl I might just keep on, lovin' you as long as I live
I don't know when to quit

There's no end to my love
Won't let you down, I won't give up
This heart will always beat for you
I couldn't stop it if I wanted to

So baby forgive me
If I move closer every time that you kiss me
'Cause I ain't ever had a feeling hit me so strong
Girl I might just keep on, lovin' you as long as I live
I don't know when to quit, I don't know when to quit

You dont even know what you did do you, baby
You never looked back when you left
You didn't see me goin crazy
Pickin up the pieces all by myself

What am I gonna do with all this love
Now that you dont need it anymore
Who am I gonna give it to, it still all belongs to you
What am I gonna do with all this love

Packed all your things away in boxes
Put them under the bed collecting dust
I hid all your pictures in the closet
Oh, but theres still so much of us

What am I gonna do with all this love
Now that you dont need it anymore
Who am I gonna give it to, it still all belongs to you
What am I gonna do with all this love

Girl, you know I wish you well but I just wish you could tell me
What am I gonna do with all this love

Ive looked all around this house
Im still tryin, tryin to figure out
What am I gonna do with all this love

Its more than I can deal with, baby
More than I can live with, baby
What am I gonna do with all this love

You left me with way too much, all these memories of us
What am I gonna do with all this love


I know it's late to be callin', whatcha doin' right now?
I couldn't wait, til tomorrow, to get to takin' you out
I gotta see you girl ASAP, I gotta get you right here next to me
Getcha right here next to me


On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Little midnight, kissin' and red wine sippin'
And listenin' to the crickets singin' love songs
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes
Hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn. Come on
Come on
Come on
Oh girl come on
Come on
Come on


I'm on my way, in a hurry, I'll be there in five
It's okay, don't you worry, I know your lookin' so fine
In that bulldog t-shirt, hair pulled back
You know I love it when you lookin' like that
You know I love it when you lookin' like that


On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Little midnight, kissin' and red wine sippin
And listenin' to the crickets singin' love songs
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes
Hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Come on
Come on
Come on
Oh girl come on
Come on
Come on


Girl, I, know, this, might sound crazy, but, I, can't, help, it
When I'm crazy for you baby, ain't playin' when I'm sayin'


We're having a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Little midnight, kissin' and red wine sippin'
And listenin' to the crickets singin' love songs
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes, hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Come on
Come on
Come on
Oh girl come on
Come on, come on
Oh girl come on, come on, come on
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin you tight, til the break of dawn

Well granddaddy came home in a B-52
In a pine box covered in red, white, and blue
He was one of the brave and the proud and the few
21 guns helped us say goodbye
I stood there in silence trying hard not to cry
As the preacher he quoted lines written in red
And he folded his bible in a broken voice he said
There's only two people whose ever died for me
Laid down their lives just so I could be free
They both went through hell bared crosses and shells
And both got back up again after they fell
They never pick a fight but their there to pick up the pieces
God only knows where we'd be without soldiers and Jesus
It seems like the news loves to run em both down
Whenever we need em there always around
So don't hand me a parties political views
There's left side and right side and then there's the truth
There's only two people whose ever died for me
Laid down their lives just so I could be free
They both went through hell bared crosses and shells
And both got back up again after they fell
They never pick a fight but their there to pick up the pieces
God only knows where we'd be without soldiers and Jesus
To me there both heroes for the path that they chose
One fights for my life one fights for my soul
There's only two people whose ever died for me
Laid down their lives just so I could be free
They both went through hell bared crosses and shells
And both got back up again after they fell
They never pick a fight but their there to pick up the pieces
God only knows where we'd be without soldiers and Jesus
Soldiers and Jesus
Well granddaddy came home in a B-52
In a pine box covered in red, white, and blue


Wreckin' balls, downtown construction
Bottles breakin', jukebox buzzin'
Cardboard sign says "The Lord is Comin'"
Tick, tick, tock
Rumors turn the mills back home
Parkin' lot kids with the speakers blown
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it
Off, off, off


Sometimes I wonder how did we get here
Seems like all we ever hear is noise


Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise


24 hour television
Gets so loud that no one listens
Sex and money and politicians
Talk, talk, talk
But there really ain't no conversation
Ain't nothin' left to the imagination
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it
Stop, stop this noise


Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise


Every room, every house, every shade of noise
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise
We can't take the noise, so we just make noise


Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise


All this noise
Can't take the noise
Can't take the noise
Can't stand the noise
Can't take the noise


Trying to live and love with a heart that can't be broken
Is like trying to see the light with eyes that can't be opened
Yeah, we both carry baggage we picked up on our way
So if you love me, do it gently and I will do the same


We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human, we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass, 'cause we are glass


I'll let you look inside me, through the stains and through the cracks
And in the darkness of this moment you see the good and bad
But try not to judge me 'cause we've walked down different paths
But it brought us here together

So I won't take that back


We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human, we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass


We might be oil and water, this could be a big mistake
We might burn like gasoline and fire, it's a chance we'll have to take


We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human and we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass, we are glass

The sun is comin' up
I gotta drag my butt out of bed
My phone is ringin', boss is screamin'
"Where the hell you at?"
I grab a cup of coffee
Tell him it won't be too long
But he don't know I'm waitin'
On something better to come along
There's gotta be something better than nine to five
Every day barely gettin' by
Workin', slavin', always achin'
Way too young for my back to be breakin'
Waitin' on that rainbow
Tell me where's that pot of gold?
Everyone is laughin' from a distance
When they see me clockin' in
Well, they'll all be here in twenty years
Cussin' 'bout the same old things
They stay late like a slave
And wake up at the break of dawn
They don't know I'm waitin'
For something better to come along
There's gotta be something better than nine to five
Every day barely gettin' by
Workin', slavin', always achin'
Way too young for my back to be breakin'
Waitin' on that rainbow
Tell me where's that pot of gold?
There's gotta be something better than nine to five
Every day barely gettin' by
Workin', slavin', always achin'
Way too young for my back to be breakin'
Waitin' on that rainbow
Tell me where's that pot of gold?
Well, I take her out on Friday
'Cause my baby likes to paint the town
The way she treats her man
Makes me think about settlin' down
(Aw, son)
I told her that I love her, she said let's just hold on
Man, I think she's waitin' on
Something better to come along
Yeah, hear she comes
Ah, let's go

Uh huh
I had a load in the dryer, I was waitin at the laudrymat
Sittin on top of a washin machine
I could hear the sound of a quarter tumblin round
I'd left in the pocket of my dirty blue jeans

I reached in just to pull it out
Never thinkin how it'd burn my hand
It rolled over by the payphone
Ain't it funny where it chose to land

Maybe it's a sign, maybe I should call
To see if everything's alright back in Omaha
Maybe you were right, maybe I'm to blame
Maybe if I try real hard baby I can change
I could do what you say and just grow up
It might be worth a shot
But then again, maybe not

I gathered up my clothes, I didn't even fold 'em
Just stuffed 'em into a pillowcase
I threw 'em in the back seat, jumped in the car
Headed on out to the interstate

I turned on the radio
How'd they know to play our favorite song?
It nearly freaked me out
To hear it on every station I turned on

Maybe it's a sign, maybe I should call
To see if everything's alright back in Omaha
Maybe you were right, maybe I'm to blame
Maybe if I try real hard baby I can change
I could do what you say and just grow up
It might be worth a shot
But then again, maybe not

Oh baby, whoa baby
Maybe not

Maybe it's a sign, maybe I should call
To see if everything's alright back in Omaha
Maybe you were right, maybe I'm to blame
Maybe if I try real hard baby I can change
I could do what you say and just grow up
It might be worth a shot
But then again
But then again, maybe not

Oh baby, whoa baby
Maybe not

Oh oh oh baby
Maybe not

Got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
Took his ring off my finger, gave him back his last name
So don't judge me, I'm doing the best I can
Got a damn good reason for this drink in my hand
Got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend

No, I didn't see it coming, she was sly as could be
I was crying on her shoulder, he was cheating on me
She never let on that it was her stealing his love
But I wised up

I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
Good riddance to 'em both, I really don't need them
I was working two jobs, they were fooling around
Crossed my mind to put 'em six feet in the ground
I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend

Trust may be something that I live without
It's gonna take a while to remove my doubt
But everyone around you at some point will let you down
That's how I feel now

I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend

Now I heard it through the grapevine, he's tired of her
Guess they're finally getting what they deserve
The last time I saw him, he had the nerve to hit on me
How sleazy can you be?

I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
Took his ring off my finger, gave him back his last name
So don't judge me, I'm doing the best I can
I've got a damn good reason for this drink in my hand

Got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend

She wakes the kids up for school
The bacon is on the stove
He yells from their bedroom
Honey, where'd you put my clothes

The school bus runs right on time
He forgets to kiss her good-bye
Walks out talking on his phone
She cleans up the mess they made
Goes upstairs and puts her makeup on

Just because she lives there don't mean she loves there anymore
If she turns to another
She knows she'll have to answer to the Lord
She wonders where the romance went
Why the man she fell in love with
Finds her so easy to ignore
Just because she lives there don't mean she loves there anymore

She's there when they get home
The day flew by so fast
She asked about his day
He interrupts, I need to cut the grass

And she's a-wishing as she does the dinner dishes
He'll notice her new dress she's got on
But he's still watching TV
She takes her bath and goes to bed alone

Just because she lives there don't mean she loves there anymore
If she turns to another
She knows she'll have to answer to the Lord
She wonders where the romance went
Why the man she fell in love with finds her so easy to ignore
Just because she lives there don't mean she loves there anymore

She wonders where the romance went
Why the man she fell in love with finds her so easy to ignore
Just because she lives there don't mean she loves there anymore
Just because she lives there don't mean she loves there anymore

All my girlfriend's are gettin' married
They're gonna be brides, they're dressin' in white
They're droppin' like flies

All my girlfriend's are talkin' 'bout babies
They're poppin' them out and strollin' around
Get me out of this town

I ain't ready for a new last name
I don't wanna be nobody's ball and chain
The reason for a Friday night poker game

I don't wanna be another desperate housewife
Doin' dirty laundry on a Saturday night
I don't wanna be somebody's
"Baby, bring me another bud light," whatever

All my girlfriend's are gettin' married
They're gonna be brides, they're dressin' in white
They're droppin' like flies

All my girlfriend's are talkin' 'bout babies
They're poppin' them out and strollin' around
Get me out of this town

They're hitchin' it up
It's wearin' me out
And tyin' the knot's all they're talkin' about

I'm so sick and tired of hearin' their vows
This bein' maid of honor's keepin' me from makin' out
'Cause all my girlfriend's are gettin' married

Well, I swear every time I get mama on the phone
She's tellin' me another good man got gone
Seems like every other dang weekend I'm goin' back home

'Cause all my girlfriend's are gettin' married
They're gonna be brides, they're dressin' in white
They're droppin' like flies

And all my girlfriend's are talkin' 'bout babies
They're poppin' them out and strollin' around
Get me out of this town

They're gonna be brides, they're dressin' in white
They're droppin' like flies
All my girlfriend's are gettin' married


Mmm, just hold it now, let me put my drink down
Baby, tell me are you really for real?
Swingin side-to-side, doin that electric slide
Spinnin' on your pretty little cowgirl boot heels
And you're all alone and that ain't right
A girl like you should have the best of everything
Like someone to treat you right
What I wouldn't give to hold you close
Longer than tonight


Cause I know a good thing when I see it
And you got somethin' like I ain't never seen before
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it
Just give me one chance and you'll never be lonely no more


The possibilities, mmm, they're killin' me
Like you're killin' every dude in the room with the way you move
And you ain't slowin' down, my heads spinnin' round
But this neon buzz is a-gettin' me up and I wanna get down with you


Cause I know a good thing when I see it
And you got somethin' like I ain't never seen before
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it
Just give me one chance and you'll never be lonely no more
Cause I know a good thing when I see it
And you got somethin' like I ain't never seen before
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it
If you let me be your man you'll never be lonely no more

I know I wasn't always so good to you
And one time I had some trouble when it came to being true
But if you're gone for good, don't think you could do better than Walter

I'm sure that Walter is a stand up guy
He may never make you laugh but he will never make you cry
But can you really see yourself turning out just like Walter

What is Walter gonna say when he finds out about the way
You used to run wild and free, you used to be in love with me
When he stumbles on those photographs
The one's of us that you still have
He sees you're not the kind of girl that fits into his perfect world
So before you meet him at that altar
Remember you're gonna have to say I do?.Walter

I bet he never had his nose broke in a barroom fight
Or got cussed out by a country judge because of one crazy night
But can you really see yourself turning out the lights and turning to Walter

What is Walter gonna say when he finds out about the way
You used to run wild and free, you used to be in love with me
When he stumbles on those photographs
The one's of us that you still have
He sees you're not the kind of girl that fits into his perfect world
So before you meet him at that altar
Remember you're gonna have to say I do?.Walter

He sat up on the bed and he watched me packing
He already knew why I was leavin'
I took what I needed but I sure left a lot still hanging
But I figured I'd get it come the weekend
He said Daddy when you get there
Are you gonna have a refrigerator
I kinda laughed and said I guess I will
Then he handed me a tracing of his hand
On the back of a piece of paper
And a magnet and my heart stood still (when he said)

Put your hand in mine
And I'll be there anytime
When it feels like you could use a friend
I'll be there to lift you up again
You can reach out to me anytime
And put your hand in mine

I drove past the Hardin Baptist Church
Though it wasn't really on the way to my hotel
Beside me on the seat I was looking at five small fingers
When I heard the chapel bell (and it took me)
Back another life ago when our hearts were open
Oh, back when we could still agree
Back when the future that we had was full of hope and
You and I we got down on our knees (and said)

Put your hand in mine
And I'll be there anytime
When it feels like you could use a friend
I'll be there to lift you up again
You can reach out to me anytime
And put your hand in mine

I couldn't even stay away one night
I noticed you left on the light
And I've only got one thing to say
If you're not too tired and it's not too late

Put your hand in mine
And I'll be here all the time
When it feels like you could use a friend
I'll be here to lift you up again
Would you reach out to me one more time
And put your hand in mine

Would you reach out to me just one more time
And put your hand in mine


Baby take off your coat
Real slow
Take off your shoes
I'll take off your shoes
Baby take off your dress
Yes, yes, yes


You can leave your hat on


Go over there
Turn on the light
All the lights
Come over here
Stand on that chair
Yeah, that's right
Raise your arms in the air
Now shake 'em


You give me reason to live




Suspicious minds keep talking
They try to tear us apart
They don't believe in this love of ours
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
But I know what love is


You can leave your hat on

It’s cold in here fells like everything’s upside down
I can feel you talking but I can barely make out the sound
I been kicking around these parts, feels like a year
I’m gonna change this world if I ever get out of here
She wants to dress me in pink, paint’s my bedroom blue
And I just laugh to myself, because only I know the truth
This love is my only emotion
Haven’t learned any fear any pain
It’s kind of funny with all this commotion
I guess they’ve got me, to blame
And they don’t even know my name
And they don’t even know my name

Well I’ve never felt so ready, think it’s finally time
Cause that big old world is waiting, and it’s mine all mine
Just then everything got real quiet, it got real bright
And a man took my hand said don’t worry, your mommas gonna be alright
Then he opened the gate, & I followed him in
Said you can wait right here, till it’s your turn again
And his love is the one true emotion
Heaven knows no fear no pain
I never got to set my wheels in motion
But they loved me just the same
And they didn't even know my name
Didn’t even know my name
You loved me just the same
And you didn’t even know my name

It was plain to see she didn't know how to ski
She said "We don't get much show in Tampa Bay"
She said, "I got confused, ended up on the blues
I was hopin' someone like you would come my way
I said, "Let's sit here and enjoy the view
Let you catch your breath for a minute or two"

The air is thin in Jackson Hole
When the sun goes down, it's bitter cold
Unless you can charm somebody into keepin' you warm
Find a hole in the wall with a cover band
Baileys and beer, yeah you laugh and dance
And you sing along to every song
And fall like the snow in Jackson Hole

Spent a couple of nights drownin' in her eyes
Gettin' lost between those tan lines from the coast
All the words we said, all the promises
I was sure she'd never let me go
But your heart can play tricks on your mind
When you're makin' love at the timber line

The air is thin in Jackson Hole

When the sun goes down, it's bitter cold
Unless you can charm somebody into keepin' you warm
Find a hole in the wall with a cover band
Baileys and beer, yeah you laugh and dance
And you sing along to every song
And fall like the snow in Jackson Hole

She had to leave on Sunday, she almost missed her airplane
We kissed goodbye, I said I'll call you first thing in the mornin'
When I woke up on Monday, I dialed the number she gave
That old man answered, said "Son, no one lives here by that name"

The air is thin in Jackson Hole
When the sun goes down, it's bitter cold
Unless you can charm somebody into keepin' you warm
Find a hole in the wall with a cover band
Baileys and beer, yeah you laugh and dance
And you sing along to every song
That's how hearts get broke in Jackson Hole, in Jackson Hole

I've had big dreams come true and I believe in
Angels although I can't see them
They're watching over everything I do
Ain't no easy street around the bend on my road
No pot of gold at the end of my rainbow
But I don't mind cause baby I got you

The rain keeps the flowers from dyin'
The sun lights the world when its shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you

I can't imagine one day without you in it
Life alone just wouldn't be worth livin'
Love would be a wish that never came true
Lord knows I've got more than I deserve
But I don't question the prayers I've been answered
I did something right cause
Baby I got you

The rain keeps the flowers from dyin'
The sun lights the world when its shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you

Verse 1

I've been around the ocean since I was a kid
I don't get to see it much these days
This mornin' I walked down to it just to say I did
And damned if it didn't take my breath away

I guess some things are just that way

Chorus

Like a baby sleeping
A mama kneeling
A Key-West sunset sky
Yeah the chills I get
When you lay your lips on mine
That's beautiful, Beautiful Every Time

Verse 2
Well I could hear the music drifting over the dunes
It sounded like a weddin' on the beach
I Figured I'd take a closer look
Had nothin' better to do
Yes I forgot the sight a blushing bride could be

Well I guess amazing is always amazing

Chorus
Like a baby sleeping
A mama kneeling
A Key-West sunset sky
Yeah the chills I get
When you lay your lips on mine
That's beautiful, Beautiful Every Time

Musical Bridge

I guess amazing will always be amazing

Chorus
Like a church choir singing
A nation healing
A soldier coming home alive
The love for me
Girl I see in your eyes
That's beautiful, Beautiful Every Time


Way on down to southern Alabama
With the guitars jammin' that's where we're headed
Straight up to Butte, Montana
Singin', "Lord, I Was Born a Ramblin' Man"
California to Oregon
Even New York City got one or two hillbillies
Ready to hit the road

Wide open throttle, Coors in a bottle
It's all for one and one for all y'all

Her momma and her daddy
And her uncle and her brother
Had her whole life planned
They had no clue what she was about to do

She met that boy
In the corduroy pants at the record store
Mopping up the floor
Looking so cute and bored

She waited in her bedroom
For the sight of his headlights
Busted down the screen
And said goodbye to her old life

And her parents' dreams went out the window
With a short blue dress and a jewelry box
She left a note saying
"I'll call you tomorrow, I love you both"
And she was gone
She was gone
Out the window

Coffee and chicken
Biscuits on the interstate
I guess beauty school is gonna have to wait
Stealing sideway kisses and singing songs
Crossing county lines
Driving all night long

He opened up her hand
Gave her a bubble gum ring
He said, "I know that this ain't much
But will you please marry me?"

And a big bouquet went out the window
Like her brown hair
Blowin' in the wind
In the passenger's seat of his blue Camero
She could see a sweeter life
A new sunrise
Out the window

Five years later
They were happy ever after making babies
Doing dishes in the kitchen
Watchin' her kids playing

And all her dreams were right there out the window
Pigtails and overalls
Making mud-pies
And she's trying to feed 'em to her little brother
Oh, what a crazy life
This, her beautiful life
Right out the window

Yeah, her momma and her daddy
And her uncle and her brother
Had her whole life planned
They had no clue what she was about to do


So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you
We'll end up hand in hand
Somewhere down on the sand
Just me and you


Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be


We drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
Just me and you
Lay underneath the harvest moon
Do all the things that lovers do
Just me and you


Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be


No we don't have a lot of money
No we don't have a lot of money
No we don't have a lot of money
All we need is love


Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be


So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you

If i'm not over you by the time i get to georgia
Then i guess i'll be alabama bound
There was a time when i'd do anything for ya
But this time baby i won't turn around
Yeah
I always wanted to get married
And i thought you were the one
But you never ever asked me
And i was tired of hanging on
You know a girl can only be let down
So many times before she runs
And now this little bitty town's only got room for one of us
You always said i'd never leave
And if i did i wouldn't go far
So i know how i must look
With my tank of gas and beat up heart
Well baby i'm gone for good
You can count on that
Yeah i'm gonna keep headin west
Till i'm too far gone to come back
And if i'm not over you
By the time i get to georgia
Then i'll be alabama bound
There was a time when i'd do anything for ya
But this time baby i won't turn around
Only got 10 miles to go
Before i cross the state line
I can feel my hands shakin
Cause they usually turn the wheel around about this time
I heard that same old voice inside
I had to drown it out
So i found me a radio station playin somethin fast
And turn it up real loud
And if i'm not over you by the time i get to georgia
Then i'll be alabama bound
There was a time when i'd do anything for ya
But this time baby i won't turn around
There was a time when i'd do anything for ya
But this time baby i won't turn around
No i won't turn around
If i'm not over you by georgia
Then i'll head to alabama
Roll onto mississippi
And maybe louisianna
I'll drive all the way to california
Oh i won't turn around
No i won't turn around
No i won't turn around
No i won't turn around.............

Look at the two of you dancing that way
Lost in the moment and each other's face
So much in love your alone in this place
Like there's nobody else in the world
I was enough for her not long ago
I was her number one, she told me so
And she still means the world to me
Just so you know
So be careful when you hold my girl
Time changes everything
Life must go on
And I'm not going to stand in your way

But I loved her first, I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But it still hard to give her away
I loved her first

How could that beautiful women with you
Be the same freckle face kid that I knew
The one that I read all those fairy tales to
And tucked into bed all those nights
And I knew the first time I saw you with her
It was only a matter of time

But I loved her first and I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But its still hard to give her away
I loved her first

From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
Someday you might know what I'm going through
When a miracle smiles up at you
I loved her first

I'll be the church, you be the steeple
You be the king, I'll be the people
While I was feeling such a mess, I thought you'd leave me behind
While I was being such a wreck, I thought you'd treat me unkind
But you helped me change my mind
I'll be the sun, you be the shining
You be the clock, I'll be the timing
While I was feeling such a mess, I thought you'd leave me behind
While I was feeling so upset, I thought the sun never shine
Then I found forever
Hey, hey, love
We've been best friends forever darling
That's what's up
Forever, no matter what
You've got my love to lean on darling
That's what's up
You've got my love to lean on darling
No matter what
You be the book, I'll be the binding
You be the words, I'll be the rhyming
While I was feeling such a wreck, I thought of losing my mind
While I was feeling such a mess, I thought the sun never shine
You be the bird, I'll be the feather
We'll be the best of friends forever
While I was feeling such a mess I thought you'd leave me behind
While I was feeling such a wreck, I thought you'd treat me unkind
Then I found
Forever, and always
You've got my love to lean on darling
All the days
Forever, come with me
You've got my love to lean on darling
All the days
You've got my love to lean on darling
All the days, all of our days yeah
Love, it is a shelter
Love, it is a cause
Love goes on forever, yeah
Love will leads us all
Love, it is our honor
Love, it is our all
Love goes on forever
Yeah, love it is our home
Oh oh oh
That's what's up
Oh oh oh
That's what's up


I found a picture of my mother in her bell-bottom jeans
Flowers in her hair
And two fingers up for peace

In that Polaroid she smiles
A grown up baby boomer
Maybe momma walked down the wild side
Walking on the moon
And what will they say about us?

I've heard stories about my grandpa
Child of the great depression
How growing up broke creates a deep and dark impression

He sits in a rocker down at the Veterans' home
Even when I go to visit
He's still rocking all alone
And what will they say about us?


They'll call us generation lost
Or generation greed
Or the connected generation to a plasma screen

Or a generation why
Enough is not enough
Or maybe they'll call us generation love
Generation love


We are children of divorce
And victims of dysfunction
We spell check of course
And GPS the proper junction
We've gotten pretty good at shifting all the blame
But I think I hear an old song
Calling my new name




When they open up our time capsule
A hundred years from now

Maybe they will look inside
And see we figured out
How to live with less
And give ourselves away


Just maybe, they'll call us
Just maybe, they'll call us
Generation love (yeah, yeah, yeah)

We are a brand new generation of love
We are a brand new generation of love (oh)

Go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Hey go
Tell it on that mountain
Jesus Christ is born

Go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I say go
Tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds
Kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light

Go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Down in that lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
God sent to us salvation
Born that Christmas morn

Hey go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

I said go
Tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born

I say go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Hey go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born


There I was ten years old
Waiting in my room for him to come home
I just knew he'd be so mad
Though I begged my mother not to, she told my dad
There was no denying I let him down
But instead of being angry
He put his arms around me and said


In the sunlight or the rain, brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
Know you're never too far gone my love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you will always be my baby


There I was twenty one
Oh I was so ashamed of what I'd done
On a country road
Parked one night
What started out so innocent
Crossed the line
There was no denying
I let God down
But instead of being angry
He let his love surround me and I heard




There he is my little man
I'm sure he'll get in trouble every now and then
And I pray to god that when he does
I'll be just as understanding as my father was
Cause the last thing that I want to do is let him down
So instead of being angry
I'm gonna throw my arms around him and I'll say



Waitin' at a stoplight yesterday
As a funeral precession made its way
Through the gates
I watched it roll up a windin' road
Through the field of green
With whitehead snow's all in a row
And it made me think about where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
On the generation mostly undeserved
Blessings that I've had

Had an all american Mom and Dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
I can't believe this life is mind

And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
I'm good to go

I've said a prayer for the dearly departed
And the loved ones left broken hearted
And traffic started

And I drove away a little more able
To see the good things on my table
For that, I'm grateful
'Cause I've had my trouble, I've had my trials
I've hit the mark and I've missed by miles
Had days when I've been fightin' mad
But the goodtimes have more than outwayed the bad

Got to hold my newborn baby girl
And the hand of a man as he slipped from this world
I've laughed so hard I couldn't stop
Seen the sunrise from a mountain top

Now, I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
(Good to go, yeah)

I've been thinkin' 'bout where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
And I wouldn't want to change nothin' about this road
With the punches life I've had

Had an all american Mom and Dad
Some of the coolest friends
That you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
I can't believe this life is mind

And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
(I'm good to go) I'm good to go
(Good to go-ooo) I'm good to go
I'm good to go (good to go)
I'm good to go (go-ooo)

We camped out on the livin' room floor
In our old sleepin' bags
By a make believe fire
In our tent made of covers
We'd talk for hours
My two brothers and me
Keepin' the faith
Racin' with destiny

Chorus

They were angels in waiting
Waiting for wings to fly from this world
Away from their pain
Treasuring time
'Til time came to leave
Leave them behind
Sweet memories
Angels in waiting
Angels in waiting for wings

2nd Verse

They always knew
They'd never grow old
Sometimes the body is weaker than the soul
In their darkest hour
I made a promise
I will always keep
I'll give them life
I'll let them live through me

(Chorus Out)

By now in New York City
There's snow on the ground
And out in California
The sunshine's falling down
And maybe down in Memphis, Graceland's all in lights
And in Atlanta, Georgia, there's peace on earth tonight

Christmas in Dixie, it's snowing in the pines
Merry Christmas from Dixie to everyone tonight

It's windy in Chicago
The kids are out of school
There's magic in Motown
The city's on the move
In Jackson, Mississippi to Charlotte, Caroline
And all across the nation, it's a peaceful Christmas time

Christmas in Dixie, it's snowing in the pines
Merry Christmas from Dixie to everyone tonight
And from Fort Payne, Alabama

God bless you all, we love ya
Happy New Year, good night, Merry Christmas

Merry Christmas tonight


She said, "Honey, do you think I'm smart?"
I said, "Of course you are, ain't you lying here in my arms?"
She smiled, "Well does this shirt make me look fat?"
I kinda leaned back and laughed
And I said, "Honey, what kind of question is that?"


You're crazy
There ain't a girl in this whole wide world
That could ever make me feel the way I do about you, baby
Yeah, you're crazy
But you can be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me


You can fuss about your hair
Say you ain't got no clothes to wear
But when you finally make up your mind
You go and change one more time
We can go out on Friday nights
A pretty girl could walk on by
If you really think I'd check her out
Come on, now


You're crazy
There ain't a girl in this whole wide world
That could ever make me feel the way I do about you, baby
Yeah, you're crazy
But you can be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me


And all my stubborn ways
Putting up with the messes I make
I even ruined our first day
Well, girl, for goodness sakes


You gotta be crazy to ever let a boy like me call you "baby"
I thank God every day  that you're my lady
Now that's a little crazy
So go on and be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me
Crazy over me

Well she's not the kind a girl
You'd meet on the corner
Of Hollywood and vine
But you might bump into her
On aisle 21 at the farmers
Feed and supply

With a bag of seed on her suntan
Shoulder cut off jeans and a tight
Tank top with a john Deere mower on it
Make you wish you were ridin' on it

No you won't see her on the cover
Of playboy magazine
Oh she's too busy getting dirty
In a field of green

She's a corn star
Talk of the crop at every county fair
Corn star
Blue ribbon winner for the last 5 years
They cut a four lane highway
Right through her pasture
Blamed it on progress
And movin' traffic faster
But every body knows the only
Reason for the road was to see her
Jug a luggin' on the top of that tractor
She's a corn star

You'd swear you'd seen her in a red bikini
On a bay watch episode
But I'm telling you straight that 600 acres
Is the only life that she knows

There gossip in town flying around
She was sunset stripping for tips in l a
But that's just a bunch of bean growers
Talking to bean loaders
What would they know about a

She's a corn star
Talk of the crop at every county fair
Corn star
Blue ribbon winner for the last 5 years
They cut a four lane highway
Right through her pasture
Blamed it on progress
And movin' traffic faster
But every body knows the only
Reason for the road was to see her
Jug a luggin' on the top of that tractor
She's a corn star

Oh shes agriculture monthly's reigning queen
Coast to coast every country boys dream

She's a corn star
Talk of the crop at every county fair
Corn star
Blue ribbon winner for the last 5 years
They cut a four lane highway
Right through her pasture
Blamed it on progress
And movin' traffic faster
But every body knows the only
Reason for the road was to see her
Jug a luggin' on the top of that tractor
She's a corn star


She's sitting by the water where the river gets wide
Think about swimming to the other side
Got a Malboro red, and a can of cold Bud
Toes squished down in the Arkansas mud


Hey Mister! Yeah, I kissed her
Son, you ought to see her sister!
You've got to give a little something to a cool dark cat
Finding him a woman who could shake like that
Hottie, she's a Hottie! Got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo)
She's rockin' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty
Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, yey Hey hey hey Hey


She's slapping down a dam
Where the moss gets thick
Yelling Yee Haw! she's a redneck chick
Spitting in the fire, putting on a show
Strutting like a chicken to the radio
Hey Slick! She's a hick!
Hmm and her butter milk lipstick
Give a little something to a cool dark cat
Finding him a woman who could shake like that


Hottie, she's a Hottie! She got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo)
She's rockin' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty
Singing Kayay digidigy
Kayay digidigy, yey Hey hey hey Hey


Dress her up boys, I took her from the farm
I brought her downtown, I hung her on my arm
You've got to give a little somethin' to a cool dark cat
Finding him a woman who could walk like that!
She's a Hottie, she's a Hottie! She's got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo)
She's rocking' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty
Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, yey
Singing Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy
Yey hey Hey hey Hey


Singing Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, Yey Hey hey Hey

Can I bum a light from you baby?
If you let me I’ll buy you a round
Sure is packed, is that seat taken?
Do you mind if I sit down?
I see you tappin’ your foot there baby
So you like that song?
Well it happens to be one of my favorites
Do you wanna dance baby? C’mon

It’s time to get a little weekend crazy
There’s no need to make it all that tough
We ain’t jumping off the deep end baby
It ain’t gotta be love
No, it ain’t gotta be love

No pressure let your hair down baby
We can take it slow
Your name and what you’re drinkin’ is all I need to know

It’s time to get a little weekend crazy
There’s no need to make it all that tough
We ain’t jumping off the deep end baby
It ain’t gotta be love
No, it ain’t gotta be love

It’s time to get a little weekend crazy
There’s no need to make it all that tough
We ain’t jumping off the deep end baby
It ain’t gotta be love
No, it ain’t gotta be love


I've had my picture made with Willie Nelson
Stayed in a hotel with a pool
Driven through New Mexico where the saguaro cactus grow
And I felt really small under Mount Rushmore


And I made it all the way past Austin city limits
And maybe for a minute, I got too big for my britches, but


I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home


Slept in a room with the ghost of Gram Parsons
Drank some wine I can't afford
Went to San Antonio to the River Walk and the rodeo
Seen the white cliffs of Dover from the shore


And I kinda fell in love with a Palm Springs trailer park
But those California stars could never steal my heart, cause


I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home


I'm happy with what I got, cause what I got is all I need
Just cause it don't cost a lot, don't cost a lot, don't mean it's cheap


I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home

I'll still call my hometown home


I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me, I said


Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you


I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me


Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you


I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
Oh, it sounds good to me


Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you


Baby, it just took one look at you
For me to change my one drink order to two
Like we already knew each other
Like we've been talking all night
About a minute into our first dance
We got blindsided by your friends
All in a hurry like you had to go
Didn't they know you can't leave someone
Girl, you can't leave someone


In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?


We were gonna dance 'till they shut it down
People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
Thinking we were so in love, yeah
They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are
I'm under these lights right here in the dark


In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me in the middle of a memory? yeah


Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me
It ain't right saying goodbye


In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what could've been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
But, girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
In the middle of a memory
In the middle of a memory


How come all the pretty girls like you are taken baby
I've been looking for someone like you to save me
Life's too easy to be so damn complicated
Take your time and I'll be waiting


Keep me in mind
Somewhere down the road, you might get lonely
Keep me in mind
And I pray someday that you will love me only


I think about you somedays
And the way I would lay and waste a day after day with you
We always go our separate ways
But no one can love you baby the way I do




Well, the world can be real tough
Find shelter in me
If there's no one else to love
Keep me in mind
If ever you wanted me, I'll be your man
I'd be a fool to let you go with someone else
Whatever you want from me, I'll be your man
I'd give it all up just to have you for myself




Well, the world can be real tough
Why don't you hold on to me
When there's no one else to love


Keep me in mind
(Keep me in mind)
And I'll hold you, darling
(Keep me in mind)
I'll be your man
(Keep me in mind)
I'll hold you, darling
(Keep me in mind)
Come on little mama
Put it on me

You always say that I have multiple personalities
I bounce around somewhere between my dreams and reality
So where'd you dig up the audacity to ask me
How we've all been doing
Since you broke our hearts
(well so far..)

(chorus)
Number 5 just cries a river a minute
7 wants to tie you up and drown you in it
Yeah, 14 just wants to say so long, bygones
32 wants to do things to you that'll make you blush
10 will key the El Camino that you love so much
And there ain't nobody wants to mess with 23
Ohhhh, lucky 4 you tonight I'm just me

I guess this party's more than your new Barbie bargained for
She's got you by the sleeve slowly easing towards the door
She's probably right, you should be movin' on
Don't know how long we can behave
Better have the valet get your car
('cause you know how women are)

(repeat chorus)

Bridge:
Forgiveness is the key
According to my shrink
But it's not just up to me
(I don't know girls, what d'ya think?)

(repeat chorus 3x)
(Fade)

I just called to let you know I'm buckled in my seat
On a jet airliner, headed back to Tennessee
We've been together for years, I'm gone for one day
Girl, I miss you like I did after our first date
And this crazy love, it's strong as it ever was

Baby, you still got it and I still want it, uh-huh, oh yeah
Just in case you didn't know it, you got it goin' on, oh yeah
I'm all yours, you're all mine, girl, you turn me on after all this time
Baby, you still got it and I still want it

So baby, fire up some candles and turn the lights down low
Dial up something sexy on the radio
I got a bottle of wine, I'm almost home
Put one of those silky little nothings on
We can stay up late, we got something to celebrate

Baby, you still got it and I still want it, uh-huh, oh yeah
Just in case you didn't know it, you got it goin' on, oh yeah
I'm all yours, you're all mine, girl, you turn me on after all this time
Baby, you still got it and I still want it

Girl, you got me hanging on your every kiss
That's the way it was, that's the way it is

Whoa now, baby, you still got it and I still want it, uh-huh, oh yeah
Just in case you didn't know it, you got it goin' on, oh yeah
I'm all yours, you're all mine, girl, you turn me on after all this time
Baby, you still got it and I still want it
You still got it
I want it, babe

Well it's late, and you know I've been up drinkin
Talkin to myself up and down the hall
Ain't it great, another fabulous disaster
Well I can't wait, for the next hammer fall

You may have won this battle baby
But it don't mean I won't win the war
And you, you don't even know what it is that you're fightin for

Well it's early, I know you've been up waitin
Waitin for me to finally call
Talkin dirty, it ain't what you really wanted
To slam another phone up against the wall

You may have won this battle baby
But it don't mean I won't win the war
And you, you don't even know what it is that you're fightin for

Well think about me when you're out there honey
You know sometimes that I will
Sometimes I feel like a broken stone rollin down your hill

You may have won this battle baby
But it don't mean I won't win the war
And you, you don't even know what it is that you're fightin for

A little boy walks in with a bloody nose
Got beat up on his way home from school...
Again!
His dad caught him runnin out the back
Tears in his eyes and a baseball bat
Oohooh revenge!
Said "son I won't stop you but before you go
Let me tell you a little story bout the
Toughest man i know

They hit him and he just turned the other cheek
Don't think for a minute, he was weak
Cuz in the end, he showed them
He was anything but frail...
They hammered him to a cross
But he was tougher than nails

Well he dropped that bat like it weighed a ton
Father put his arms around his son and said..
Just let it go...
Believe me I've been in your shoes
Had to ask myself "what would Jesus do"
And here's what i know
Whenever I'm in doubt I look up what he said
It's all there in the good book
In black and white and red

They hit him and he just turned the other cheek
Don't think for a minute, he was weak
Cuz in the end, he showed them
He was anything but frail...
They hammered him to a cross
But he was tougher than nails!

Yeah in the end, he showed them
He was anything but frail
They hammered him to a cross
But he was tougher than nails!

Tougher from nails!

Ooh ooh oh oh!

Waitin' On Joe
(Steve Azar)

We're supposed to start work down on the river today
And for Joe and me, it's some pretty good pay
Now, I was countin' on him
To be at the dock by ten
A week's pay says he's still at home
'Cause the boy's in his own time zone

I'm a waitin' on Joe, whaddya know
Time flies fast and he is slower than a.....
I told him over and over: "Now don't you be late."
Ah, but like always
I'm just sittin' on go
And waitin' on Joe
Yeah

Towboat's a leavin' 'cause it don't care
What's not on board and who's not there
Once that whistle blows
Down the mighty river it rolls
Man if I could be more like that
I'd get on with my life and never look back

Instead of waitin' on Joe, whaddya know
Time flies fast and he is slower than a.....
I told him over and over: "Now don't you be late."
Ah, but like always
I'm just sittin' on go
And waitin' on Joe
Waitin' on Joe

And he's in a hurry
'Cause he's runnin' behind
Now I'm not one to worry
But I've got a real bad feeling this time
Oh, oh, oh, whoa

'Cause sirens are crying all through this town
And one old boy said Joe never slowed down
He tried to beat that morning train
My life will never be the same
I didn't even tell my brother goodbye
Lord i wish somehow he could give me a sign

Yeah, I'm a-waitin' on Joe, whaddya know
Time flies fast and he is slower than a.....
I told him over and over: "Now don't you be late."
Ah, but like always
I'm just sittin' on go
And waitin' on Joe
Waitin' on Joe

Oh yeah
You got me feeling like a Saturday night
You got me buzzing like a Miller Lite sign
No last call inside, hell it's gonna be a wild ride
And you, know what you're doing when you do
That lipstick dance on the cigarette
And that moonlight and moonshine
Hell I just want to cross the line with you
(That's right)
You got me rocking, rolling, like New Orleans
Cut off booze like damn you know it
Little bit a drink, little wink wink
Tell me what you think I've been looking for a party like you
You get dancing, hearts get stolen
Love the way the night is going
Little bit a drink, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like you
All them dudes
Been looking at me wondering what would I have to do
To wind up on this bar stool next to you
Shooting "quila" with a hottie
They just over there shooting pool
Oh and I, yeah I'm a damn lucky guy
I must have done something along the way that's right
Good Lord has blessed me with a hell of an angel tonight
You got me rocking, rolling, like New Orleans
Cut off booze like damn you know it
Little bit a drink, little wink wink
Tell me what you think I've been looking for a party like you
You get dancing, hearts get stolen
Love the way the night is going
Little bit a drink, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like you
Yeah a party like you
I said a party like you girl
You got me rocking, rolling, like New Orleans
Cut off booze like damn you know it
You get dancing, and hearts get stolen
Love the way the night is going
Little bit a drink, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like you
Yeah, I said a party like you
Oh I said a party like you girl
A party like you
Oh yeah yeah

Well I sure am tired of these coffee house gigs
Cause there ain't no money and there ain't no chicks
It's gettin harder and harder to get my kicks so I bought a little ticket to Nashville
Cause I wanna see my name up in neon lights drink pink champagne and party every night
All them lucky muthers up there livin the life man I gotta get my ass to Nashville

Cause

I wanna be a country star
And take it all way to far
Drinkin free in every bar
Just like Bocephus

A I think it'd be a cryin shame
Not to have my own airplane
I wanna go up in flames me and my guitar
Man I wanna be a country star

Well I got a drinkin problem so I'll fit right in
Gonna sing me some hits and get some famous friends
I'll be ridin shotgun with Kenny, Faith, and Tim
And I wonder how they lived without me

I'll get "Big & Rich" rich and build a big ol' house
With a big ol' fence to keep the rif raf out
Call my old girlfriends say "how ya like me now"
C'mon baby tell me what ya love about me

I'm gonna be a country star
And take it all way to far
Breakin all the young girls hearts
Just like Keith Urban

Man I'm thinkin that sure sounds fun
Rockin out with Brooks and Dunn
All the way to number 1
Me and my guitar
Man I wanna be a country star

Playin golf with Vince and Willie
Hangin out with Carrie UNDERneath those big spotlights

YEAH YEAH

YEAH YEAH

I'm wanna be a country star
Take it all way to far
Breakin all the young girls hearts
Just like Keith Urban

OH

Man I think it sure sounds fun
Rockin out with Brooks and Dunn
All the way to number 1
Me and my guitar
Man I wanna be a country star

Country Star

YEAH!


Ain't nothing out here but me, the road and the radio
Looking for an exit and a song that I might know
Counting down the memories and adding up the miles
Searching for a feeling I ain't felt in a while


Clarity and inspiration
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find
It may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leaning on some friends I know
The road and the radio


Spent the night in Carolina, got up early out of bed
Bought a Red Bull and a road map and a old Stones cassette
Setting my sights south bound, no reason or rhyme
Threw up a prayer just looking, just looking for a sign


And some clarity and inspiration
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find
It may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leaning on some friends I know
The road and the radio


In my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leaning on some friends I know
The road and the radio
The road and the radio
The road and the radio


Mmm-mmm-mmm
The road and the radio
The road and the radio
Mmm-mmm-mmm


Monday, hard to wake up
Fill my coffee cup, I'm out the door
Yeah, the freeway's standing still today
It's going to make me late, and that's for sure
I'm running out of gas and out of time
Never gonna make it there by 9:00


There's got to be something more
Got to be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
I'm going to take my chances
Taking a chance I might
Find what I'm looking for
There's got to be something more


Five years and there's no doubt
That I'm burnt out, I've had enough
So now boss man, here's my two weeks
I'll make it short and sweet, so listen up
I could work my life away, but why?
I got things to do before I die




Some believe in destiny, and some believe in fate
I believe that happiness is something we create
You best believe that I'm not going to wait
Because there's got to be something more


I get home 7:30 the house is dirty, but it can wait
Yeah, 'cause right now I need some downtime
To drink some red wine and celebrate
Armageddon could be knocking at my door
But I ain't going to answer that's for sure
There's got to be something!




Got to be
Got to be more


I don't feel like loving you today
So don't you even try to change my mind
The best thing you can do right now is just go away
Cause I don't feel like loving you today

I don't want to talk about last night
I'm angry and haven't had much sleep
And I'm so tired and bloodshot
There ain't no telling what I'd say
Cause I don't feel like loving you today


But you know I will anyway
Even though we make it hard sometimes
I'll wind up forgiving you
And probably loving you for the rest of my life
But I don't feel like loving you today


And I've got sixteen hours left to go
I might tell you that I'm leaving
Even though you know I'll stay
Cause I don't feel like loving you today




But I don't feel like loving you today
I just don't feel like loving you today


Well high school got me educated
Still when I graduated
I didn't have a clue
Did a stand in the Navy
They did they're best to break me
Somehow I made it through
I've had some hard knocks
I've been around the block
But baby I believe
That loving you made a man of me
Raising hell racing cars
Closing down the local bars
That what I used to do
Family told me settle down
Find yourself some solid ground
Where you can put down some roots
Back then I thought love
Was only sissy stuff
But now I see
That loving you made a man of me
Loving you made a man of me
Don't know what it is you do
But everytime I'm holding you
I know what my heart is for
I'm the one you lean on
Gotta be strong
It's not just about me anymore
Well goodbye to my blind and immature days
Loving you made a man of me
Made a man of me, yeah
Made a man of me, wow
I'd still be only lost and lonely
As a boy can be
Can't you see
That loving you made a man of me
Loving you made a man of me
You made a man of me
Man of me, yeah


Why does the color of my coffee match your eyes?
Why do I see you when a stranger passes by?
I swear I hear you in the whisper of the wind
I feel you when the sun is dancin' on my skin
And when it's raining
You won't find me complaining 'cause


When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you


The taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kiss
I like the way that they both linger on my lips
Kisses remind me of a field of butterflies
It must be the way my heart is fluttering inside
Beautiful distraction
You make every thought a chain reaction


When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

Anywhere I go, anything I do
Everything around me, baby
Makes me think of you


When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you


When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

Ohhh, ohh, ohhhh
When I think about you, baby
Yeah, yeah
I think about you

I can make my mind up
I can put my foot down
Yeah, I can stand my ground
Resolve that I'm not gonna fall
I can try to evade it, try to avoid it
Tell myself to just ignore it
But I know that order's just too tall
Cause there's the vision of your eyes
The linger of your touch, it's too much

Here it comes like a rolling thunder
Like a wall of marching soldiers
Oh, it just takes me over
And I can't fight it, no
Yeah, well it's just your love
That's a burning in my blood
So tell me, how on earth can I deny it
When my heart keeps beating it into my mind

Like the sunrise, like the four seasons
Oh, it just keeps repeating
Yeah, it's a constant in my world
So I might as well give
And I might as well face it
Just open up my arms and embrace it
Because I know I love you girl
Cause there's a meaning in my life
A connection in our soul, here I go

Here it comes like a rolling thunder
Like a wall of marching soldiers
Oh, it just takes me over
And I can't fight it, no
Yeah, well it's just your love
It's a burning in my blood
So tell me, how on earth can I deny it
When my heart keeps beating it into my mind

Here it comes like a rolling thunder
Like a wall of marching soldiers
Oh, it just takes me over
And I can't fight it, no
Yeah, well it's just your love
It's a burning in my blood
So tell me, how on earth can I deny it
When my heart keeps beating it into my mind

Beating it into my mind


You never looked so good
As you did last night
Underneath the city lights
There walking with your friend
Laughing at the moon
I swear you looked right through me
But I'm still living with your goodbye
And you're just going on with your life


How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all


You, I hear you're doing fine
Seems like you're doing well
As far as I can tell
Time is leaving us behind
Another week has passed
And still I haven't laughed yet
So tell me what your secret is?
To letting go, letting go like you did, like you did


How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all


Did you forget the magic?
Did you forget the passion?
Did you ever miss me
Ever long to kiss me?
Oh oh baby, baby


Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all




Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it


I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction


This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it


Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
Follow you, follow you home


This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I


Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
Follow you, follow you home


This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it


Girl, don't hang up
I called on purpose
Yeah, I've had a few
Hell, I'm hurting
Our song came on the radio
I could hear you singing along
So I took the long way home
So I could listen to it all


Sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This ain't no drunk dial
Ain't no words that I'm forgetting
In the morning
Still mean everything I said
I know it's late and I ain't called in awhile
But this ain't no drunk dial


We ain't got to talk about what happened
But I'll take the blame
If you want me to have it
Somewhere in this full moon night
There's a way to make this whole thing right
If you leave the front door open
I'll be there before you know it


This ain't no drunk dial
Ain't no words that I'll forget
In the morning
Still mean everything I said
I know it's late
And I ain't called in a while
But this ain't no drunk dial
This ain't no drunk dial


This ain't courage from a bottle
It's just one last shot to give it all we got, yeah


Sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But this ain't no drunk dial
Ain't no words that I'll forget
In the morning
Still mean everything I said
I know it's late
And I ain't called in a while
But this ain't no drunk dial
This ain't no drunk dial
This ain't no drunk dial
This ain't no drunk dial


It sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Like a rainy Sunday morning makes me want to stay in bed
Twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs


Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me


You make it easy loving up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy


You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell


You make it easy loving up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy


Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me


You make it easy loving up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy

I keep hearin' your concern about my happiness
But all that thought you've given me is, conscience I guess
If I were walkin' in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worryinbout me, I'm havin'lots of fun

(Chorus)
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
You can always find me here and havin' quite a time

(Chorus)
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do

It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

(Chorus)
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do


Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine


Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save


Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine


Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by


Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Me and some of the boys were sitting around the other night
Started talking about politics, religion, love and life
And what a shame it was about 9/11
And what about hell and what about heaven
And is there or isn't there angels on earth
And then one guy said
Well you can take that for what it's worth
If it's something I can see or something I can touch
Well I might believe in all that stuff
So I just had to say to him
Are you telling me you've never seen an angel?
Never felt the presence of one standing by
No robe of white, no halo in site
Well you missed the most obvious thing
Man, are you blind? Just look in your mothers eyes
And then I said "Who went through the pain
And smiled through the tears on the day of your birth?"
She counted your fingers and toes and thank God you were whole
Son you outta know who loved you first, that's right
And who always came running every time you cried out
And how many more things have you forgotten about
And who tried their best to teach you wrong from right
And how many nights did she leave on the light
While she waited and prayed that you came in
And who'd be there for you right up to the end think about it tonight
Are you telling me that you've never seen an angel?
Never felt the presence of one standing by
No robe of white, no halo in sight
Well you missed the most obvious thing
Ah man, are you blind? Just look in your mothers eyes
Ah man, are you blind? Just look in your mothers eyes, well that's right


You ever wondered why country songs say the same old thing
Like a broken record skipping down on main
Pretty girls, pickups and cut-off jeans?
You know what I mean

Dirt roads, corn rows and homemade wine
Juke joints, jumping on the county line
Heard them sing about it a million times
But I don't mind


As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that slide guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealing those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we rock, and that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio


There's always going to be a party out in the pines
Always going to be a shot up highway sign
Paper sack full of beer and a jar of shine
From time to time

There's always going to be people trying to run us down
Saying we aren’t got nothing on a big town
I bet they'd come around
If they came on down




There's always going to be a part of me
Kicking back in BFE
Yeah, that's how it's always going to be




Some country on the radio
As long as there's a small town
Saturday nights
Blue jean babies
Yeah, tip back your Dixie
Stealing those kisses

(Andy Childs/Steve Mandile)

I never meant to fall in love again this way
(Oh,I'm in way too deep)
But there's somethin' 'bout the way she says my name
(I tremble every time she speaks)
I should've learned by now to take it slow
(But down I go)

I'm in way too deep
I can't help but love her
Ain't no way to keep
Me from goin' under
I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
No savin' me (No savin'me)
I'm in way too deep
(I'm in over my head)
(Every little thing she said haunts me in my sleep)
I'm in way too deep
(I can't dig my way out)
(No livin' without her)
(I'm in way too deep)

Hey,don't even bother throwin' me a line
(No,I'm in way too deep)
Ain't no need to rescue me 'cause she's so fine
(Can't fight it 'cause her love's so sweet)
She's gonna be the death of me,I know
(What a way to go)

I'm in way too deep
I can't help but love her
Ain't no way to keep
Me from goin' under
I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
No savin' me (No savin' me)
I'm in way too deep
(I'm in over my head)
(Every little thing she said haunts me in my sleep)
I'm in way to deep
(I can't dig my way out)
(No livin' without her)
(I'm in way too deep)

Yeah,yeah,yeah

She's gonna be the death of me,I know
(But it's out of my control)

(I'm in over my head)
(Every little thing she said haunts me in my sleep)
(I can't dig my way out)
(No livin' without her)
(I'm in way to deep)

(I'm in over my head) way too deep
(Every little things she said haunts me in my sleep) I can't help but
Love her
Ain't no way to keep
(I can't dig my way out)
Me from goin' under
(No lovin'without her)
(I'm in way too deep)

I'm in way too deep
I can't help but love her
Ain't no way to keep
Me from goin' under
I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
No savin' me (No savin' me)
I'm in way too deep
(I'm over my head)
(Every little thing she said haunts me in my sleep)
I'm in way too deep
(I can't dig my way out)
(No livin' without her)
(I'm in way too deep)

Way too deep
(I'm in over my head)
(Every little thing she said haunts me in my sleep)
Out of my head,no I can't sleep
(I can't dig my way out)
(No livin' without her)
(I'm in way too deep)


Said I was in my early 40's
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says


I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'


He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
And then


I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'


Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it


Sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'


To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'


Doublewide Quick Stop midnight T-top
Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and Daddy put their roots right here
‘Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dawn school bus kickin’ up red dust
Pickin’ us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the vents


We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright


Baptist church parkin’ lot, tryin’ not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin’ it to second base, but sayin’ you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend Daddy doesn’t like
Now he’s sittin’ out back, 30/30 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light


We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright

We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright


I know they say "you can’t go home again"
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard


I thought if I could touch this place, I'll feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me


Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream




You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am




Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell twist
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air


What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh


Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock




Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That’s the jingle bell
That’s the jingle bell
That’s the jingle bell rock


After all this time I still miss you every day
The same world spins 'round
I guess some things never change
Sometimes I go out but it never feels the same
I still look for you
Baby some things never change


When I said I'd love you for eternity
I just never knew how true those words would be
Just an old love song
Just a mention of your name
My heart breaks in two again
I guess some things never change


Maybe someday someone else will set me free
Until then I'll live with your loves legacy
And I'll keep holding on
Hoping you'll come back someday
You can rest assured
Baby some things never change
Girl I'm still in love with you
I guess some things never change


I still love you


They wouldn't let him play the Opry
With whiskey on his breath
And it didn't take them long
To figure out what they missed
He went down that lost highway
Underneath that purple sky
A legend disappeared before his time
Things Change


They said he was the devil
Dressed in gold lame
The way he shook his hips
Out there on that stage
But before that faithful day
He left Tennessee
All of them were calling him the king
Things Change


Well they like to call them hippies
Outlaws with guitars
But they brought a little poetry
To the honky tonks and bars
They might have got a little crazy
They might have flown a little too high
But somewhere somebody is playing their song tonight
Things Change
(Don't you know they change)


Now some say it's too country
Some say it's a little rock n roll
But it's just good music
If you can feel it in your soul
It doesn't really matter
It's always been the same
Life goes on
Things change


Do'nt you know they change
Oh, things change
As long as this world is turning
Things are going to change
Going to keep on changing
Going to change


Raise 'em up
I'm talkin' 'bout a lighter on a Saturday night
The band plays a song you like and you sing along
Raise em up
I'm talkin' 'bout Daddy's old pickup truck
Shotgun seat, there's the one you love and you're kissin' on


Get those white sails sailing down in Mexico
It's just a whiskey glass if you ain't makin' a toast
Lift your tear-filled eyes up to the sky
A comin' home, you've been gone too long
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up


Raise 'em up
You got a voice, you got a choice
Go make some noise
Don't ever let 'em tell you who you are
Raise 'em up
Fist black and blue, fight for the truth
Its what you do
Hand on your heart for the stripes and stars


Black umbrellas in the pourin' rain
A Sunday Morning Coming Down, Amazing Grace
Lift those tear-filled eyes up to the sky
As the flag flies, say goodbye
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up


So, you meet someone
The only one
You take her by the hand
Make a stand
Buy some land
Make some love
And them babies come


Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up trophy high
Raise 'em up to the sky
Raise 'em up, show everybody that newborn smile
Raise 'em up tall and strong
Raise 'em up right from wrong
Raise 'em up so damn high they can hear God singing along
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah


You've been whispering things I've never heard
Love's been redefined, it's more than just a word
I never thought I'd fall again
But roads divide and new roads begin
So it could take a lifetime to find someone like you


I've been looking for a love like that
Once you start it you can't turn back
I get the feeling that I'm looking at
The answer to my prayers
Cause when you lay me down you set me free
My heart stops when you touch me
I've been looking for a love like that


Each time it felt so right
It always turned out wrong
I know it was you, I wanted all along
I thought it was impossible
But I think I found my miracle
I only needed someone who needs me like you do




I want an earth shaker
A risk taker
One hell of a love maker
Somebody that wants nobody but me




I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white


And may all your Christmases be white

Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A new born King to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

So to honor Him, pa rum pum pum pum
When we come

Little Baby, pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give the King, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

Shall I play for you, pa rum pum pum pum
On my drum?

Mary nodded, pa rum pum pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pum pum pum
I played my drum for Him, pa rum pum pum pum
I played my best for Him, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

Then He smiled at me, pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum

There's a want and there's a need
There's a history between
Girls like her and guys like me
Cowboys and angels

I've got boots and she's got wings
I'm hell on wheels and she's heavenly
I'd die for her and she lives for me
Cowboys and angels

We ride side by side
A cloud of dust, a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
She's sweet, I'm wild, we're dangerous
Cowboys and angels

I'm not sure why her path crossed mine
Accident or grand design
Maybe God just kinda likes
Cowboys and angels

We ride side by side
A cloud of dust, a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
She's sweet, I'm wild, we're dangerous
Cowboys and angels

There's a want and there's a need
There's a history between
Girls like you and guys like me
Cowboys and angels

Out of nowhere
You just wanna be free
Cut me loose
Forget all about me

About this little five letter word

It's called karma

What goes up comes down
Hits the ground
You're gonna find out
All about, all about
Kkkkkkarma


He did not have to wake up
He would been up all night
Laying there in bed listening
To his new born baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee
He splashes water on his face
His wife gives him a kiss and says
It is going to be OK


It would not be like this for long
One day soon we will look back laughing
At the week we brought her home
This phase is going to fly by
So baby just holds on
It would not be like this for long


Four years later bout four thirty
She is crawling in their bed
And when he drops her off at preschool
She is clinging to his leg
The teacher peels her off of him
He says what can I do
She says now do not you worry
This will only last a week or two




Someday soon she will be a teenager
And at times you will think she hates him
Then he will walk her down the isle
And he will raise her veil
But right now she up and crying
And the truth is that he do not mind
As he kisses her good night
And she says her prayers
He lays down there beside her
Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
Cause he already knows
It would not be like this for long
One day soon that little girl is going to be
All grown up and gone
Yeah this phase is going to fly by
He is trying to hold on
It would not be like this for long
It would not be like this for long


You look out the window while I look at you
Saying "I don't know"
Would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore


You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy


After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town


So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space


You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy

So we had a few drinks
Had some laughs at the bar
Stayed out too late
And went a little too far
Oh but wakin' up
With you on my chest
I had a pounding heart, and achin' head, and no regrets

Who knows, we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be

Rule number one
Friends don't break
We could write it off
As a sweet mistake
Only time will tell
If we were wrong or right
All I know is I don't want to be alone tonight

Who knows, we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be

We wound up here so naturally
Me and you baby
You and me
Could it be
Could it be

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be
Is this love
Or could it be

It ain’t a needle in a vein
It ain’t backstage sex
It ain’t lines of cocaine on a private jet
It ain’t havin’ a posse full of hangers on following you around
It ain’t long hair, tattoos, playin’ too loud
(No)

It ain’t a middle finger on a t-shirt
The establishments tryin’ to sell
It’s a guy with the balls who told the establishment
To go to hell
It ain’t about the money you make, when a record gets sold
It’s about doin’ it for nothin’, cause it lives in your soul

That’s damn rock and roll
That’s damn rock and roll

It’s a rock through a window
It’s a riot in the street
It’s a rebel revolution
It’s fightin’ for pieces
Burn baby burn
It’s a brick in the wall
It’s the first one to stand
And the last one to fall
It’s a hip shaking devil on the stage in Tupelo
It’s doing what ya want instead of doin’ what your told
It’s a preacher burning records, tellin’ folks they oughta pray
Cause the shepherd bought a Gibson, and led the flock astray

That’s damn rock and roll
Give all ya got ‘till there ain’t nothin’ left
That’s damn rock and roll

The Clash crashed the party
And the party got loud
And the party turned into an angry crowd
Drowning demons feel no pain
Found Nirvana wasted shame
Gone too soon just like a song
Hendrix, Joplin. What went wrong?
Need some answers right or wrong
Need something to blame it on
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)

That’s damn rock and roll
(Give all ya got till there ain’t nothing left)
That’s damn rock and roll
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)

Another day in another town
Loadin’ the stage, and the lights, and the sound
Here they come boys
They’ve opened doors
Count us off now Craig
(1, 2, 3, 4)

That’s damn rock and roll
Give all ya got till there ain’t nothin left
That’s damn rock and roll
Gather round ‘till you’ve broken a sweat
That’s damn rock
That’s damn rock and roll
(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)


Work sucks, truck died, hot as hell outside
My A/C just broke (just broke)
The woman I love packed half of my stuff
And she took off down road


Where she went, I don't know
But she’s never comin' back
My life feels like a joke
But it hurts too much to laugh


So I go
To that little place where the good times always roll
In the glow of the neon light where I know
There’s a new song I'll be singin'
Before I leave, yeah I believe
In the power of positive drinkin'


Beer one…tastes just like a beer
Beer two…a little bit better than one
Beer three…beer four
Yeah that was pretty damn good so hand me one more
Beer five…and I'm comin' alive
Beer six…man that went down quick
Seven, eight, nine…I'm feelin' fine
And by number ten life's good again
Yeah....That’s the power of positive drinkin'


Where she went, I don't know
But she’s never comin' back
My life feels like a joke
But it hurts too much to laugh


So I go
To that little place where the good times always roll
In the glow of the neon light where I know
There’s a new song I'll be singin'
Before I leave, yeah I believe
In the power of positive drinkin'


Beer one…tastes just like a beer
Beer two… is a little bit better than one
Beer three…beer four
Yeah that was pretty damn good so hand me one more
Beer five…and I'm comin' alive
Beer six…man that went down quick
Seven, eight, nine…I'm feelin' fine
By number ten life's good again
That’s the power of positive drinkin'


So I go
To that little place where the good times always roll
In the glow of the neon light where I know
There’s a new song I'll be singin'
Before I leave, yeah I believe
In the power of positive drinkin'

As the power of positive drinkin'


The phone lights up in the dark
Asks where you are and I start driving
Meet me for a drink
Just an hour, maybe two, maybe three
Baby I'm in
Girl, you can't take your eyes off me
And that first kiss is sweet relief
Ain't no one gotta know
Just one more before you go


I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret
But I will if you want me to
You can leave me in the dark
If that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon
Yeah, he can be the sun
I'll be the moon


The phone lights up in the dark
Gotta go I know but it still ain't easy
Tomorrow you'll be waking up beside him
Tell him that you love him
But you still see me
In my mind when I'm looking at him
And in my eyes
It's the obvious elephant in the room
He can't see it, but girl you do


I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret
But I will if you want me to
You can leave me in the dark
If that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon
Yeah, he can be the sun
I'll be the moon


The phone lights up in the dark
Yes it's my turn, and I start driving


I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret
But this is something I can't lose
You can leave me in the dark
If that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon


Phone lights up in the dark


Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Let's whisper, let’s don’t talk
Baby, leave my t-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we’ll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It’s time we made it happen


Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down


I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain’t holdin’ nothin’ these two hands
Until they’re holding you again


Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down


I don’t wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So let's close our eyes


And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down


There's somethin' pulling' on me
Out of nowhere like a mystery
An I won't find it here in my backyard
So I'm gonna go an I don't care how far
Drivin' through the night wherever it goes


By the mornin' light I'll be down that road
Where a heart can see and the headlights know
Where the night ends an the dawn begins to glow
It's a healin' time it's a moment of truth
When all your fears come crashin' through to the other side
Where you play your mind and let go
'Cause nothin' can dry your eyes
Like a highway sunrise


Wheels turnin' in my mind
Tail-lights dancin' in my eyes
An there's no horizon just a fade to black
An I'll be breakin' through with my foot on the gas
Somewhere I've never been is leadin' me on


By the mornin' light I'll be down that road
Where a heart can see and the headlights know
Where the night ends and the dawn begins to glow
It's healin' time it's a moment of truth
When all your fears come crashin' through to the other side
Where you play your mind and let go
'Cause nothin' can dry your eyes
Like a highway sunrise


Somewhere I've never been is leadin' me on


By the mornin' light I'll be down that road
Where a heart can see and the headlights know
Where the night ends and the dawn begins to glow
It's a healin' time it's a moment of truth
When all your fears come crashin' through to the other side
Where you play your mind and let go
'Cause nothin' can dry your eyes
Like a highway sunrise

Like a highway sunrise
Chase down a highway sunrise


When I was nineteen I threw my stuff in the car
I headed up to the Rockies, got a job at this bar
Selling beer to the locals, just barely getting by
On the tips from the rich kids, there on daddy's dime
But when I saw her walk in one night
I knew that I would be all right in


Telluride, the snow falling down
I was waking up in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive
I never will forget the moment she arrived
In Telluride


We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire
Casting shadows on the cabin wall, drowning in desire
Confessing all our secrets and laughing out loud
So high up on that mountain, I thought we would never come down
It was a dream we were living in
And I was the happiest I had ever been in


Telluride, the snow falling down
I was waking up in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive
I never will forget the moment she arrived
In Telluride
Telluride, whoa-oh-oh


It ended just like a movie scene
And I had to play the part
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave
And me with the frozen heart


In Telluride, the snow falling down
Standing there alone in that sleepy little town
In her eyes, my world came so alive
I never will forget the day she said goodbye

Telluride, the snow falling down
I was waking up in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive
I never will forget the moment she arrived
In Telluride


All of my life I thought I knew the answers
Until you came along I never questioned why
You showed me what it means to love someone forever
You're the dream in my heart
It's always been there
You're the window to my soul


I live, I die, I'm born, I'm sanctified
In your love, in your love
I'm home, I'm free, I've found everything I need
In your love, in your love


I don't know just how or where I'd be without you
Now that you've become a part of who I am
I can feel your touch in everything that I do
You're the smile when I cry
You're the road when I'm lost
You're the breath that gives me life


I live, I die, I'm born, I'm sanctified
In your love, in your love
I'm home, I'm free, I've found everything I need
In your love, in your love


I'll do anything for you just to prove my faith
In your love, oh yeah


I live, I die, I'm born, I'm sanctified
In your love, in your love
I'm home, I'm free, I've found everything I need
In your love, in your love


I live, I die, I'm born, I'm sanctified
In your love, in your love
I'm home, I'm free, I've found everything I need
In your love, in your love


I was sitting on a wooden stool
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee
When this old boy walked in
And he sat right down next to me
I could tell he'd been through some hard times
There were tear stains on his old shirt
Then he said do you wanna know what you get
When you play a country song backwards


You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
Ya get your first and second jobs back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring
Your get your farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
That old black cat named Charlie
It sounds a little crazy, a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards


Well I never heard it said quite like that
It hit me in the face cause that's where I'm at
I almost fell flat out on the floor
He said wait a minute that's not all there's even more


You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your achy breaky heart back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn
And the rake and the mower
You go back when life was slower
It sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards
Oh play that song
Woo!


We sat there and talked about how it would be
If we could just rewind it all and go back in T-I-M-E


You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
Ya get your first and second jobs back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring
Your get the farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
That old black cat named  Charlie
You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your achy breaky heart back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn
And the rake and the mower
You go back when life was slower
It sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards


It was yesterday
It was years ago
We were singing every word on the radio
Kinda like them songs that saved our souls
Somehow, someway
We was falling fast
We was jumping in
Blue jean halo hanging off the limb
Two American kids just like them
Every time they played
And it blew us away


Do you turn it up
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song
Like we did then
Like we did when

Do you close your eyes
Does it make you laugh
Do the memories take you back
Six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane


Yeah, we remember growing up and growing old
Breaking up or letting go
Girl's just like Rock-n-Roll
Where has it gone
But I hope like hell every now and again
I blow across your mind like that summer wind
And you're holding on to sixteen as long as you can
Every time that it comes on


Do you turn it up
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song
Like we did then
Like we did when

Do you close your eyes
Does it make you laugh
Do the memories take you back
Six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane


Do you turn it up
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song
Does it still groove you
Baby, Hallelujah

Do you close your eyes
Does it make you laugh
Do the memories take you back
Six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane


Yeah, way back
Way on back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, do you close your eyes
Does it make you laugh
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, let the memories take you back
Take you back
Take you back


I heard you were back in town
Well it's been a hot minute since me and you were hanging out
Yeah we had that crazy kind of chemistry
Where you get burned, don't learn, don't care
Just reach for another match and gasoline


Knock knock, here you come a-knockin' on my door
But you're gonna have to wait on the porch


Better hide the wine
And get it gone
I better hide every one of them records that turn me on
(Lock 'em up, lock 'em up)
Turn up the lights
And kill the mood
Because baby I just don't trust myself with you
I better hide the wine


Well I know me and I know you
I better get rid of all the Two Buck Chuck
And the high-dollar good stuff too
'Cause baby if I don't, then you know what we'll do
One sip, one tip, we'll be sitting on the couch
You'll be kicking off your shoes


Better hide the wine
And get it gone
I better hide every one of them records that turn me on
(Lock 'em up, lock 'em up)
Turn up the lights
And kill the mood
Because baby I just don't trust myself with you
I better hide the wine
I better hide the wine, yeah


Knock knock here you come a-knockin' on my door
But you're gonna have to wait another minute on the porch
Oh no, no, it's a dangerous thing pouring alcohol on an old flame


Better hide the wine
And get it gone
I better hide every one of them records that turn me on
(Lock 'em up, lock 'em up)
Turn up the lights
And kill the mood
Because baby I just don't trust myself with you
I better hide the wine
Oh I better hide the wine, yeah
(Knock knock, here you come a-knockin' on my door
Gonna have to wait another minute on the porch)
Oh I better hide the wine


There's a Tennessee two lane sky
Shakes the Broadway bars at night
Makes you wanna get a little too close
To a Cali girl watchin windshield satellites
It's a soundtrack to our lives
It's the only reason why
A kid from Carolina would drive to Nashville to chase a dream
Without a dime


It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in the neon lights
Sweet Home Alabama and Ring of Fire
I could sing along til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in a bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one and she whispers turn it up


For a second we're bulletproof
We get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
Three chords and the truth


I see you blinking through your blue eyes
How a song can turn back time
You can almost feel the sand on your feet
From the passenger seat
Singing anything but mine
Don't you know we were raised on the radio


It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in the neon lights
Copperhead Road and Mama tried
I could sing along til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in a bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one and she whispers turn it up


For a second we're bulletproof
We get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
Three chords and the truth


It's Muscle Shoals to rock n' roll
It's a steel guitar that steals your soul
It's a country song that takes you home again


It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand and church pew aisles
Amazing Grace and In Sweet By and By
I could sing along til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in a bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one and she whispers turn it up


For a second we're bulletproof
Get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
Three chords and the truth


Ba bom bom
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to ride around in a dirty old truck
Catch a bunch of fish and shoot a bunch of duck
It's alright to be a redneck
Chase around girls on Friday night
You want to make them feel alright


It's alright, it's alright, it's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to work hard in the sun all day
Drink a couple beers after baling hay
It's good to be a redneck
Drive by Ernie's for some barbecue
Showing off your brand new boots


It's alright, it's alright
It's alright to be a redneck


The kids are going to cry
And the chickens going to fry
Oh, you know it
Your car won't run
So your cousin's coming by to tow it


Ba bom ba bom
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to have a girl
Name'a Thelma Lou
That don't mind a little kiss
When you got a little chew
Party on the road
By the light of the moon
Dancing to a country tune




Yeah...it's alright, it's just right
It'a alright to be a redneck
Ba bom bom


O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the souls felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn


Fall on your knees!
Oh hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, O night divine


Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
All chains shall He break everyone is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all our hearts we praise His holy name


Fall on your knees!
Oh hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, O night divine!


His name was Steve
Her name was Gina
(You've never been here before have you)
They met at a bar called Cabo Wabo Cantina
He was a minstered salesman from South Dakota
She was a first grade school teacher Phoenix Arizona
(No, my first time here)
They started dancing and it got real hot
Then it spilled over to the parking lot
One more tequila they were falling in love
One more is never enough


Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico


He woke up in the morning and he made a little telephone call
To check on his wife and his kids back at home in Sioux Falls
(Hey babe everything okay)
She hopped right in the shower with a heavy heavy mind
(What am I doing)
He knew it was the first time Gina had ever crossed that line
They walked down to the beach and started drinking again
Jumped into the ocean for a dirty swim


One more margarita then we're falling in love
One more's never enough


Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Oh Mexico


Waiting at the bar at the terminal gate
She says "Steve I gotta go, I'm going to miss my plane"
He said "one more tequila for you climb on up"
She said "one more's never enough"


Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Oh Mexico

That sleepy old sun finally reared its head
Sneakin' through the window sayin' get out of bed
Kids are laughin' and playin' outside in the streets
I step out on my front porch in my bare feet
Drink my coffee, walk the dog
Then I'll stop by your house
'Cause I was hopin' maybe
We could just hang out

Chorus:
'Cause days like this are made for doing nothin'
But layin' around soakin' up your lovin'
There ain't nothing better than a long, lingering kiss
On days like this

Let the wind blow wild
Let it mess up our hair
Watch the world blow by like we don't have a care
When those old crickets start singin'
And the moon shows its face
We'll still be lying on this blanket
Letting time slip away

Days like this are made for doing nothin'
But layin' around soakin' up your lovin'
There ain't nothin' better than a long, lingering kiss
On days like this

There ain't nothing wrong with bein' lazy
So come on over here and love me baby
Love me baby

Days like this are made for doing nothin'
But layin' around soakin' up your lovin'
There ain't nothin' better than a long, lingering kiss
On days like, days like this

Days like this
Days like this
Days like this

{Verse 1}
I turn the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

{Verse 2}
You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

{Bridge}
We don’t have to miss each other, come over
We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

{Outro}
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over


Lipstick, pretty face
And maybe you’ll notice something
Different about me, different about me
Yeah, you talk talk all you want
You pour your heart out
But you never do see, you never do see me


You, I can’t wait forever for you


Sooner or later
You’re gonna come around
You’ll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always
Everything that you needed
Sooner or later
You’re gonna wish you had me
Yeah, you’re gonna wish you had me


Well she don’t do
Nothing for you
But mess you up
Yeah, she messes you up
I’m your shoulder
I’m the quick drive over
Tryin' to fix your stuff
Well, I give up


You, you never see me standing right in front of you


Sooner or later
You’re gonna come around
You’ll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always
Everything that you needed
Sooner or later
You’re gonna wish you had me
Oh, you’re gonna wish me back so bad, so bad
Oh, but it’s a little too late for that


Lipstick, pretty face
And maybe you’ll notice something
Different about me, different about me


Sooner or later
You’re gonna come around
You’ll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always
Everything that you needed
Sooner or later, oh
Sooner or later
You’re gonna come around
You’ll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always
Everything that you needed
Sooner or later
You’re gonna wish you had me
(Sooner or later) Oh, you’re gonna wish you had me
(Sooner or later) Oh, you’re gonna wish you had me
(Sooner or later) Oh, you’re gonna wish you had me
(Sooner or later) Oh, you’re gonna wish you had me

I work all day in a breakneck run
Just to come home to another pile of work to be done
And all I wanna do is flop on the couch and die
Baby comes in he's give out too
I say "It's pizza or nothing. And Trixie's all outta dog food"
I could just break right down and cry

I need a vacation from my life
Me and my husband we need a wife
Somebody who's sole ambition is laundry
I wanna fall asleep on "MY" patio swing
While somebody else does the dishes and cleans
Mariachi's could stroll through the yard and play softly
Wouldn't even have to leave 2523 General George Patton Drive
And I need a vacation from my life

Don't even get me started on Saturday's
All I do is rearrange the clutter
Hey, I invented shabby chic
Who wants to mow when it's so dang hot
Me and baby got a theory about our little half acre lot
If it blooms, it's not a weed

"OH" I need a vacation from my life
Me and my husband we need a wife
Somebody who's sole ambition is laundry
I wanna fall asleep on "MY" patio swing
While somebody else does the dishes and cleans
Mariachi's could stroll through the yard and play softly
Wouldn't even have to leave 2523 General George Patton Drive

Oh, I need a vacation from my life
Me and my husband we need a wife
Somebody who's sole ambition is laundry
I wanna fall asleep on my patio swing
While somebody else does the dishes and cleans
Mariachi's could stroll through the yard and play softly
Wouldn't even have to leave (Midstate), Tennessee 2523 General George Patton Drive
I need a vacation from my life
"Oh i need a vacation from my life"
"that's Right"


Cut my teeth on daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a redbone on my side


And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky down to Alabam'
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind


I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine


And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to The Rio Grande
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind


Yeah there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran'
Just don't give a damn all the time
In an outlaw state of mind


Tell me have you ever wanted
Someone so much it hurts?
Your lips keep trying to speak
But you just can't find the words
Well I had this dream once
I held it in my head


She was the purest beauty
But not the common kind
She had a way about her
That made you feel alive
And for a moment
We made the world stand still

Yeah, we owned the night


You had me dim the lights;
You danced just like a child
The wine spilled on your dress

And all you did was smile
Yeah, it was perfect
I hold it in my mind

Yeah, we owned the night


When the summer rolls around
And the sun starts sinking down
I still remember you
Oh, I remember you
And I wonder where you are

Are you looking at those same stars again?
Do you remember when?


We woke under a blanket
All tangled up in skin
Not knowing in that moment
We'd never speak again
But it was perfect;
I never will forget
When we owned the night

Yeah, we owned the night

At the Bama Breeze
You can shoot some pool down there
You can act the fool down there
You can play it cool down there

At the Bama Breeze
You can drink some beer down here
Argue, laugh, and cheer down there
Pass another year down there

Jimmy got caught smokin' a joint out behind the bar
Sittin' in his car and they took him to jail
The tip jar paid his bail

In 1984, Mick Jagger passed through town
Bought the house a round and signed his name on the wall
In the ladies bathroom stall
Yeah...

At the Bama Breeze
I turned 21 down there
Had too much fun down there
Stumbled out with the sun down there

Saturday nights the bouncer Grady
Lets the ladies in free with a fake ID
And a short enough skirt
Yeah, he figures what the hell could it hurt

Second set the owner LuLu gets up with the band
A beer in her hand and sings "Free Bird" slow
Then she raises a toast
Here's to Ronnie and the boys
Now everybody make some noise

At the Bama Breeze
You're one of our own down there
You'll never drink alone down there
Good god I feel at home down there

At the Bama Breeze
You're one of our own down there
You'll never drink alone down there
Good god I feel at home down there


MMMM better, MMMM better
Absolutely no one that knows me better
No one that can make me feel sooo goooood
How did we stay so long together?
When everybody, everybody said we never would
And just when I, I start to think they're right
That love has died


There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again
Heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time?
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in
Right back in
And I know-oo I'm never letting this go-ooo
I'm stuck on you
Whutooo whutooo
Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue
Whutooo whutooo
Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue


Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up
When it doesn't matter who's right, fight about it all night
Had enough
You give me that look
"I'm sorry baby let's make up"
You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that




You almost stay out, too stuck together from the ATL
Whutooo Whutoo
Feeling kinda sick?
Just a spoon full of sugar make it better real quick
I say
Whutooo Whutoo
What you going to do with that?
Whutooo Whutoo
Come on over here with that
Sugar sticky sweet stuff
Come on give me that stuff
Everybody wants some
Melodies that get stuck
Up in your head
Whutooo whutooo
Up in your head
Whutooo whutooo
Up in your head
Whutooo whutooo
Up in your head
Whutooo whutooo
Whuthoo whutooo
Stuck like glue
You and me together, say, it's all I wanna do
I said



Her momma named her Daisy, got it from a magazine
Through the mountains in her white dress, she'd run chasin' me
Thought she was faster, cause I told her so, even though it wasn't quite the truth
Well I know she's an angel even though she ain't got wings
'Cause my sweet Daisy loved the hell outta me

There in the back pew of a Sunday morning church
The preacher preachin' Gospel, well that's when I gave her her first kiss
She told me so even though it wasn't quite the truth
Well I know she's an angel even though she ain't got wings
'Cause my sweet Daisy loved the hell outta me

She gave me her body, she gave me her soul, didn't ask for nothin
She led me down to the river, said you need to be Baptized
Held me under the moon light, Lord I don't know why
She loved the hell outta me

Eight years later we got married, and the day her water broke
The doctor said there's complications, but I still had hope
She was gonna make it 'cause she told me so, even thought it wasn't quite the truth
Well I know she's an angel, and now she's got her wings
Yeah, my sweet Daisy loves the hell outta me

She gave me her body, she gave me her soul, didn't ask for nothin
She led me down to the river, said you need to be Baptized
Held me under the moon light, Lord I don't know why
She loved the hell outta me, yeah

I thought I'd name her Daisy, in her Momma's memory
Through the mountains in her white dress, she runs chasin' me

Sometime I think what turned her on
Was my old broke down boots
She wanted her a real cowboy
It was a phase she was goin' through

But not one week after she moved in
I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue
She brought home a bottle of pink Chablis
And poured out my best brew

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
While she packed her things to leave
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She changed direction headed out west
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess
Her dark brown hair went blonde
And her pretty blue eyes went green
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

She was sittin' beside the ocean
Looking out at the waves
Watching how they keep on rollin'
But always seem the same

She called and said she'd been thinkin' about
All those quiet country nights
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me
Suddenly seemed all right

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
When her truck pulled into view
She said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you

She changed direction headed back home
She changed her tune it's all Haggard and Jones
She had her dark brown hair pulled back
And blue eyes like you've never seen
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She said I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be
Yeah, she changed her mind when she couldn't change me


I drive away from your house, chasing butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it


I said "Girl, you're beautiful, and you already know it
But I'll say it again and a million times after that"
You laugh and you shake your head and say
"Boy, you're crazy"
Well, girl, if I'm crazy, I'm only crazy 'bout you
I was lookin' right into your eyes, right then
Porch light
Flipped on and I saw your dad
Lookin' through the window
Hope he ain't mad
Then I helped you outta my truck
Through the yard to your front door
Said "Girl, am I gonna see you again?"
You answered me back with a kiss


I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say "I love you" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said "She's the one"
Said "Boy, better get that ring
If you really wanna change her name"
Like a merry-go-round
Got my head spinning round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me


I picked you up for our second date
You're sure looking pretty
Sweet as an angel, here to save my soul
Yeah, you get me high, you take me to heaven
And I get to shaking when you put your lips on mine
It could be the best night of my life, least 'til next time
Oh yea, gotta get this right
Follow all the rules and be back by 9
Pulled up to drop you off, leaning in to sneak one more
Said "Baby, when can I see you again?
How 'bout every night after this?"


I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say "I love you" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said "She's the one"
Said "Boy, better get that ring
If you really wanna change her name"
Like a merry-go-round
Got my head spinning round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me


Yea, that's just what you do


I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say "I love you" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said "She's the one"
Said "Boy, better get that ring
If you really wanna change her name"
Like a merry-go-round
Got my head spinning round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me


I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valedictorian so
Under your number I wrote "call for a good time"

I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud


How do you like me now?
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn’t make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?


When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and tore them apart

He never comes home
And you’re always alone
And your kids hear you crying down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing
Who could that be singing
Its me baby, with your wakeup call!




Tell me baby
I will preach on


She don't throw any t-shirt on and walk to a bar
She don't text her friends and say, "I gotta get laid tonight."
She don't say, "It's okay, I never loved him anyway."
She don't scroll through her phone just looking for a Band-Aid


It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls


She don't sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
She don't have the luxury to let herself go
(She won't call just to curse
Found a wall she can punch
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough)


It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls


It's different for girls
Nobody said it was fair
When love disappears, they can't pretend it was never there


A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough
So tough
It's different for girls
It's different for girls

There are teddy bears and high school rings
And old photographs that mamas bring
That daddies with their young boys, playing ball
There's combat boots that he used to wear
When he was sent over there
There's 50,000 names carved in the wall

There's cigarettes, and there's cans of beer
And notes that say I miss you dear
And children who don't say anything at all
There's purple hearts and packs of gum
Fatherless daughters and fatherless sons
And there's 50,000 names carved in the wall

They come from all across this land
In pickup trucks and mini vans
Searching for a boy from long ago
They scan the wall and find his name
The teardrops fall like pouring rain
And silently they leave a gift and go

There's stars of David and rosary beads
And crucifixion figurines
And flowers of all colors large and small
There's a Boy Scout badge and a merit pin
Little American flags waving in the wind
And there's 50,000 names carved in the wall

There's 50,000 names carved in the wall

I woke up early this morning with a pounding in my head
I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wondering what i did
I said lord please forgive me for my sins
My wife wanted to kill me but she tried to save me first
You're going if i have to drag your butt to church

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
Made it throught the sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beers, watched the game and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
My poor mother sat between them both all night

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

We said a prayer for cousin micheal in iraq
We're all aware he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he wanted to be a soldier more than most

I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life was like a rollercoaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you've shed some tears
I could die today or i might live on for years

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life


Appreciate your call, means a lot and all
Yeah, I got a minute
You and me can talk about anything you want
As long as she ain't in it
Say, it's been at least a month since I've had any fun
Buddy, I'll admit it
Yeah, I might be going out
Think I'm ready for a crowd
As long as she ain't in it


Don't wanna hear her name
Don't wanna see her face
I swear, I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere


We could hit that place down by the interstate
Out past the city limits
Hangout all night long
Hear a country song
As long as she ain't in it


Don't wanna hear her name
Don't wanna see her face
I swear, I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere


I can drink and I can dance
I can party, I can laugh
But no matter how you spin it
Everything has changed
My life won't be the same
As long as she ain't in it
As long as she ain't in it


She was dancing in a sundress on a Carolina sunset
On the last night of Merle Fest
Told me she ain't missed one since the summer she turned eighteen
Hit that road on a gypsy dream
Hitched a ride in a beat-up van, following her favorite band


And now she's a Bonaroo baby, she's Coachella crazy
She'll be folking out in Newport, you've probably seen her before
Up at Lollapalooza, in the muddy Wakarusa
She'll be at the hangout down in Alabama
Just look for the girl in the blue bandana, whoa, whoa


She had a flower in her hair, a little smoke was in the air
We were chillin' in some lawn chairs saying
We wish we could've seen Woodstock
Told me she was leaving in the morning, heading down to New Orleans
Said boy, you oughta come along and I knew I shoulda gone


She's a Bonaroo baby, she's Coachella crazy
She'll be folking out in Newport, you've probably seen her before
Up at Lollapalooza, in the muddy Wakarusa
She'll be at the hangout down in Alabama
Just look for the girl in the blue bandana, whoa, whoa


Several thousand faces in a crowd
And I know she's out there somewhere jamming out


She's my Bonaroo baby, she's Coachella crazy
She'll be folking out in Newport, you've probably seen her before
Up at Lollapalooza, in the muddy Wakarusa
She'll be at the hangout down in Alabama
Just look for the girl in the blue bandana, whoa, whoa


Now I got a beat up van and I'm driving across this land
Looking for a blue bandana




I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all


You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did


You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do


You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did


Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon
Looking like a high I wanna be on


You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

The tree's in the corner
The fire's burnin' bright
Shadows dancin'
In the pale candlelight
Life should be a rainbow
But it's blue
It won't be Christmas without you

I wrapped up all your presents
Wrote my name on every card
I just can't help it baby
I'm taking this so hard
You tell me, what's a man to do
'cause it won't be Christmas without you

I stare into the flame
All I see is your face
All this joy and happiness seems so out of place
As far as I'm concerned
It's just a day I must get through
It won't be Christmas without you


There's a boat, I could sail away
There's the sky, I could catch a plane
There's a train, there's the tracks
I could leave and I could choose to not come back
Oh never come back
There you are, giving up the fight
Here I am begging you to try
Talk to me, let me in
But you just put your wall back up again
Oh when's it going to  end


How far do I have to go to make you understand
I want to  make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't
Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are
So I'm going to walk away
And it's up to you to say how far


There's a chance I could change my mind
But I won't, not till you decide
What you want, what you need
Do you even care if I stay or leave
Oh, what's it going  be




Out of this chair, or just across the room
Halfway down the block or halfway to the moon




YeahI'm gonna walk away
And it's up to you to say how far


Christmas trees and window panes
Shimmering where tinsel hangs
And the butter light of candlesticks
Chases snowflakes off the bricks
The postman is shivering
With packages he's delivering
Ribbons pulled and try to hide
Wishes waiting warm inside


And everything looks better in gold and green
The lights on the trees shining all through the city
Are the prettiest I've ever seen
And the world decides to sleep safe tonight


The carolers they sing noel
Silent night and silver bells
And all around you snow will fall
Like confetti stars and paper dolls


And everything looks better in gold and green
The lights on the trees in the eyes of our children
Are the prettiest I've ever seen
And the world decides to sleep safe tonight


The first noel
The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields where they lay


Everything looks better in gold and green
Everything looks better in gold and green
Everything looks better in gold and green
Everything looks better in gold and green
Everything looks better
Everything looks better

(Radney Foster/Harlan Howard)

Baby,it's a scary old world we're livin' in
Sometimes it's hard to tell who's really your friend
But there's not much that I'm sure of but one thing's the Gospel truth
I wouldn't be so damned afraid of what's on the evenin' news
If I could just wake up every mornin'

Why do I, choose the things I choose
Why do I, always find some lame excuse
Why do I, not realize what I could do
Oh, I wish I knew the reason why

Why do you, get that sad look on your face
Why do you, pull away from my embrace
Why do you, see all my faults and my mistakes
Oh, I wish you knew the reason why

Why do we, treat each other like we do
It's like we never even try
Why can't we, get back to the love we knew
Oh why oh baby why

Why do we, have to play those same old games
Why do we, run away from who's to blame
Can't they see, to lose this love would be ashame
Oh I wish we knew the reason why
Oh I wish we knew the reason why


I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It don’t leave my sight since we had that fight
Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it


I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up


Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock, you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers


I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up


I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed
And I don’t get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it up


She don't laugh at everything
But when she does the planets swing around her
She don't step on sidewalk seams
Teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
She don't need the glitter of the Vegas lights
She could blow a kiss and leave you spinning like a Tilt-A-Whirl


I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world
I met a girl


The sunshine waits for her to wake up
She's a ponytail, no makeup, Saturday
'Cause she don't need umbrellas in a summer rain
She could catch the eye of a hurricane in blue jean pearls


I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world


She turned around
And it felt like the world turned upside down
And the only thing that I could say was hey
And I'm so glad she didn't walk away

She dances like nobody sees her
Can't believe I get to be here in her world


I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world
I met a girl

God Bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her, and guide her
Through the night with the light from above

From the mountains, to the prairies
To the oceans, wide with hope
God Bless America
My home sweet home

God Bless America
My home sweet home
God Bless America

From the mountains, to the praries
To the oceans, wide with hope
God Bless America
My home sweet home

God Bless America


Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Yeah
Ooh-oh-oh
O-oh-oh
O-oh-oh


I've been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours for what
Oh, tell me what I got
I get this feeling
Times just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town


Tonight I got to cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut loose


You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Deep way down in your heart
You're burning yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life aren’t passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You'll get by if you'd only


Cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
O-wee Marie, shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo, come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut loose


Ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Ooh


We've got to turn you around
And put your feet on the ground
Now take a hold of your soul

I'm turning it loose


Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut loose
(Footloose) footloose


Kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut


(Everybody) everybody cut loose


I woke up in Nashville
But it still felt like a dream
Like the one I've been chasing
Since the day I first played my dad's six string


I loaded up the hand-me-down car
Went for broke, broke your heart
Didn't wanna but, girl, I thought I had to
But dreaming's just sleeping here without you


So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up


I woke up in Nashville
'Cause those Broadway lights don't shine
The way that your eyes did
When they were staring back, right back in mine


Been trying to live with only half of my heart
Just sleepwalking in the Tennessee dark
If I can't make every memory with you
Then dreaming's just sleeping here without you


So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up


In a cold sweat
And catching my breath
Dropping my pride
And dropping you a line
I don't know where you are
I don't know who you're with
I don't know what to say
But I'm saying it


Hello
I'm glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up


I woke up in Nashville
Just thinking of you still


I've always been one of them boys
Rolling around in jacked up toys
Making noise on small town Friday nights
Red light running, good time chasing
Guess I've earned this reputation
Probably never shake it but that's alright


I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Yea, point at you


Girl I ain't sure just what it is
That's got me all tore up like this
Your kiss done melted down this heart of stone
I still like to get a little crazy
But something about your loving baby
It breaks me down and makes me want to haul ass home


I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Point at you, yea


Oh girl I wouldn't blame ya if you tried to change me
Lord knows I'm hard to hold
But I guess you kinda like all of my sides
And I ain't letting you go
Cause my best side is holding me close
Point at you, yeah


I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you

Oh baby, I just point at you
Yeah girl
Girl I point at you
Oh babe my best side is you
Girl I point at you


I guess I said some things last night
That usually in the morning light I regret
Like double shots and cigarettes
Said things like "I love you baby" and
"I know I sound crazy but let's just work this out
Yeah, and maybe settle down"


I woke up hung over
But still had to call you
Cause I just realized girl
That maybe it was all true Yeah


I let the whiskey talk
And baby it said too much
I got the feeling now
It didn't say enough
Cause I'm waking up alone
Missing that midnight kiss
I can't promise you forever
All I know is I still want you to come over
And I'm stone cold sober


I can lie about ninety-nine percent of the time
When I've had too much to drink
Yeah I do stupid things
But this time is different
And baby it feels so right
I hope you were listening
To every word I said last night, yeah


I let the whiskey talk
And baby it said too much
I got the feeling now
It didn't say enough
Cause I'm waking up alone
Missing that midnight kiss
I can't promise you forever
All I know is I still want you to come over
And I'm stone cold sober


Yeah I got blood shot eyes (Got blood shot eyes)
But it's all crystal clear (All crystal clear)
Well I know I don't need Jim Beam
To know I need you here, yeah


Yeah, I let the whiskey talk
And baby it said too much
And I got the feeling now
It didn't say enough
Cause I'm waking up alone
Missing that midnight kiss
I can't promise you forever
All I know is I still want you to come over
Baby all I know is I still need you to come over
And I'm stone cold sober


Yeah baby I'm stone cold sober
Come on over


Well I know there's a reason
And I know there's a rhyme
We were meant to be together
That's why
We can roll with the punches
We can stroll hand in hand
And when I say it's forever
You understand


That you're always in my heart
You're always on my mind
But when it all becomes too much
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way


I could have turned a different corner
I could have gone to another place
Then I'd of never had this feeling
That I feel today, yeah


And you're always in my heart
Always on my mind
When it all becomes too much
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way

Oh


And you're always in my heart
Always on my mind
When it all becomes too much
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way


Only you can love me this way


Everybody's always waiting on Friday
Watching that clock and sitting on go
Whatcha' say we find a little warm sunshine
An open umbrella on the patio
I don't need a reason or a happy hour
Ain't hangin' 'round for a fireworks show
Get a head start, a little sip of somethin'
Off and running, here we go
One, two, three, here we go


Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?


Blame it on the work day
Blame it on the heatwave
Blame it on the tick-tock movin' too slow
Blame it on any old thing you want to
Ready, get set, baby, here we go


Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?


Day drinking, d-d-d-day drinking
Day drinking, d-d-d-day drinking


Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling all right
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?

I wish I would've laid my hands on you
Shown you a thing or two
I wish I would've pushed you against the wall
Lock the door and bathroom stall, windows and the screen

I wish you would've laid your hands on me
That kind gonna bring me to my knees
I wish I would've let you lay me down
'Cause I wouldn't be here wishin' now
I wish I would've laid my hands on you


I wish I was still half drunk
Still tangled up
Still making love
But instead I'm alone in bed
With you in my head
Can't get you out of my head
Mmm, mmm
My only regret...

I wish I'da laid my hands on you
Got you high in a motel room
Little secret for my soul
No one sees and no one knows
Forbidden company
I wish you'da laid your hands on me
And never let me go
Drawing pictures on my skin
Places no one's ever been
I wish I'da laid my hands on you


I wish I was still half drunk
Still tangled up
Still making love
But instead I'm alone in bed
With you in my head
Can't get you out of my head
Mmm, mmm
My only regret...

I wish I would've laid my hands on you
Shown you a thing or two
I wish I would've pushed you against the wall
Lock the door and the bathroom stall, windows and the screen

I wish you'da laid your hands on me
That kind gon' bring you to your knees
I wish I'da let you lay me down
'Cause I wouldn't be here wishing now
I wish I would've laid my hands on you

You like a dozen wine red roses
Candlelight on porcelain set tables
And that's fine, I'll go out of my way
For you anytime
That's right baby

The fire's warm
So you take off your sweater
Now it's my turn and I'll do you one better
That's the game we both like to play

CHORUS
You wink
I laugh
'cuz we know a little hug leads to a foot rub
Then a hot tub
Then a french kiss on a bear rug
Do you like it, do you like it
How about this wanna try it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll Take That As a Yes

You like snuggling with your pillow
With my arms tight holding us together
Breathing deep and drifting like a feather in a stream
Then I touch you on the shoulder
Feel your skin soft underneath my fingers
And I know we'll never get to sleep

Repeat CHORUS

It's written all over your face there's no mistake
No guess, no doubt, no beatin around the bush
Baby it's understood

Repeat CHORUS

I'll Take That As a Yes
I'll Take That As a Yes

Cause we know a little hug leads to a
Foot rub, hot tub, bear rug, yeah

Wouldn't you love
Wouldn't you love
Wouldn't you love
I like it, I like it yes


I woke up this morning with a buzz rollin' 'round in my brain
I haven't been drinkin', but it feels pretty good just the same
It must be contagious, looks like it's goin' around
It's cool once you catch it, you can't keep your feet on the ground


Come on, come on, let's get something started
(Let's get something started now)
Come on, come on, let's start something now
(Let's start something now)


We're gonna rock this country
We're gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy, every blue-eyed girl
Gotta really go psycho, give it a whirl
We're gonna rock this country
Right outta this world
Ah-ooh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na...


From Utah to Texas, Minnesota, Mississippi too (that's right)
Or Nevada, no matter where you live, this buzz is for you


Come on, come on, let's get something started
(Let's get something started now)
Come on, come on, let's start something now
(Let's start something now)


We're gonna rock this country
We're gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy, every blue-eyed girl
Gotta really go psycho, give it a whirl
We're gonna rock this country
Right outta this world
Ah-ooh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na...
Let's go
Hey, hey, hey


We're pluggin' in the power
Crankin' up the sound
It's comin' your direction
It's headin' to your town
We're kickin' up dust
Blowin' off steam
Let's get nuts now
Everybody scream


We're gonna rock this country
We're gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy, every blue-eyed girl
Got gotta really go psycho, give it a whirl
We're gonna rock this country
Right outta this world
Ah-ooh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na...


Get ready, we're comin'

I always kinda figured love would pass me by
The kinda girl I wanted wouldn't want a guy like me
I thought that she wouldn't look twice

You see I'm kinda crazy, I like the extremes
So all of my life the girl of my dreams was
Everything nice, sugar and spice and tequila on ice

I was looking for a saint who was a devil of a lover
But every girl I found was either one way or the other
'Til one night at a bar when I saw her standing there
Pretty thing in blue jeans with a daisy in her hair

I walked over to her and introduced myself
I said, "Now that we know each other
If your not with someone else, can I buy you a drink?"
She said "Thank you, I think I'll have tequila on ice"
Ha ha, and I said, "Nice"

I was looking for a saint who was a devil of a lover
But every girl I found was either one way or the other
But this one here was different I could see it from the start
Pretty thing in blue jeans, kinda sweet and wild at heart

I guess that's what got me down here in Cancun
Lying in this hammock looking at the moon up there
Stroking her hair and picking out rice

My baby's kisses taste like sugar and spice
And tequila on ice


If anybody had told me, that anybody'd have a hold on me
I'd say they were out of their mind
But speakin' of crazy, I'm findin' lately
All I want, all I need, all the time is


More of your sweet love, too much just ain't enough
I never needed a fix like this before
Too strong to resist, I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store, you keep me comin' back for more


I can't explain it, I'm more than infatuated
You got me good, I got it bad
There's no doubt about it, I can't live without it
What you got I just got to have, so give me


More of your sweet love, too much just ain't enough
I never needed a fix like this before
Too strong to resist, I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store, you keep me comin' back for more


Too strong to resist, I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store, you keep me comin' back for more


You keep me comin' back for more
You keep me comin' back for more, more, and more , and more
Comin' back for more, more
Keep me comin', give me some more
I'm comin' back for more


It was a perfect day for the end of May, they say a record high
I was starin' at that green water
When out of the blue and by surprise
She had her feet up on the cooler as she put our love on ice
She grabbed a beer, said, "I'm out of here"
And walked out of my life


That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that
Hell hot summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one


It ain't the first time, or last time I watched love walk out
But it's damn sure the one time I still ain't forgot about
I still like to drink a beer but a long neck I won't do
Cause every time I see one sweating, man
I break out in one too


That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that
Hell hot summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one


That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that hell hot summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one
Damn babe, that was a cold one

Lookin out my window
Looking down the road
I would like to go, far away
Away from this place
I wanna see the world
Before I die
Before too many years go by, I've got to go
Before I get to old


Cuz I'm goin away and I'm leavin today
And I won't be back for a while
Gettin on a train, a bus or a plane
I'm gonna leave this place in style
But before I go I just want you to know
That although it hasn't been very long
We'll meet again together my friend
And we'll laugh and we'll sing this song
Friends will leave you and they will say farewell
And you can never tell, just why they go
You don't know, you don't know
I want light music to softly hit my ear
You know I've been waiting for years
To take a chance, and to dance, with the wind


So I'm goin away and I'm leavin today
And I won't be back for a while
Gettin on a train, a bus or a plane
I'm gonna leave this place in style
But before I go I just want you to know
That although it hasn't been very long
We'll meet again together my friend
And we'll laugh and we'll sing this song
Cuz I can't be tied down
Sittin in a on-horse town
I've got to know, who I am
I pray for you all the time
You'll always be, on my mind
And I hopw you understand
That I'm goin away and I'm leavin today
And I won't be back for a while
Gettin on a train, a bus or a plane
I'm gonna leave this place in style
But before I go I just want you to know
That although it hasn't been very long
We'll meet again together my friend
And we'll laugh and we'll sing this song
And we'll laugh and we'll sing this song


Every day's a lifetime without you
Hard to get through, since you’ve gone
So I do the only thing I know how to, to get by
I’m livin' for the night


I’ve drawn all the curtains in this old house
To keep the sun out, and off of my face
Friends stop by to check - in ‘cause I’ve checked out
I tell 'em I’m fine, I’m just livin' for the night


Daylight can’t hide the tears I cry, the pain that came with your goodbye
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
I’m livin' for the night




I’m a whole lot easier to talk to, when I’ve had a few, I settle down
Whiskey kills the man you’ve turned me into
And I come alive
I’m livin' for the night


Daylight can’t hide the tears I cry, the pain that came with your goodbye
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
I’m livin' for the night
I’m livin' for the night


Every day's a lifetime without you

When she picked up the telephone
His voice came on the line
She said, "This can't be happening"
And tears fell from her eyes
She said, "What am I supposed to do?
I can't handle losing you"
He said, "I just had to call and say goodbye
One last time"

He said, "There are some things in this life
That are out of our control
Like who we fall in love with
And when it's time to go"
She said, "What about the plans we had?"
He said, "This connection's getting bad
Now come on, baby, let me hear you smile
One last time"

She started to apologize
For all the things that she'd done wrong
She said, "I would have loved you better
If only I had known"
He said, "You were the perfect wife
Promise me you'll go on with your life"
She said, "The boys won't understand"
He said, "Tell them daddy loves them and
Be strong," whoa

He said, "Hun, I've gotta go"
She said, "Don't you dare hang up
There's so many things I need to say
I love you so much"
It was almost like she felt him leave
She cried out, "Can you still hear me?"
She fell down on the kitchen floor
When the signal died
As the pilot tried to pull out of the dive
One last


Tired of my beeper, tired of my phone
Tired of this tired ol' tie I got on
Sick of this traffic jam that I'm in
We all get sick of it all now and then
When I've had it up to here
I go down there


To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer
When enough is enough
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love


I feel like a fish jerked out of the sea
Or a bird in a cage that's never seen a key
Sick of this grind and I think that I ought
To bring this grind to a grinding halt
Now I've had it up to here
Let's go down there


To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer
When enough is enough
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love


Now I've had it up to here
Let's go down there


To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer
When enough is enough
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love

Moving on wasn't in the plan
I was living in that happy-to-be-right-where-I-am space
And god knows that's a hard-to-get-to kind of place

But I took a right into another world
I didn't like much when you left me girl
I gotta tell you it's been pretty hard
But every now and then I turn around
And there you are
Everywhere I go

Everywhere I go there's a sign from a time you were mine
Everywhere I go there's a tear that leads me to your smile
Just like you said you'd be
Anytime I needed you here to comfort me
Though it's only a memory
But I swear you're here right there
Everywhere I go

It took a while for the wheels to turn
I guess the more you think you know about this life
The more you find you haven't learned
But every now and then it'll break me down
Long enough to slow my motor and look around
At every stop we made along the way
And I see your face everywhere I go

Everywhere I go there's a sign from a time you were mine
Everywhere I go there's a tear that leads me to your smile
Just like you said you'd be
Anytime I needed you here to comfort me
Though it's only a memory
But I swear you're here right there
Everywhere I go

Every night and every dream
Every part of everything
It seems there's always something
That stops me everywhere I go

Thank god you swore to be
Anytime I needed you here to comfort me
And though it's only a memory
But sometimes I get caught in the thought long enough
And I swear you're here right there


You ain’t got a dress that I don’t like
You ain’t got a pair of jeans that don’t fit you just right
There’s not a minute in the day
That you don’t knock me out, you don’t blow me away


But, girl, now that the sun's gone down (whoa-oh-oh)
Looking at you right here and now, baby


Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you


I can taste the midnight on your lips
Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
Wind blowing your hair around
Girl, it makes me want to lay you down
You've been beautiful a million times
But I've never seen you look like this, no


Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you


Looks so good on your skin
I don't ever, no, I never
I don't ever, ever want to end, baby


Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you


Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby

You look good at party
Good at the bar
Something bout underneath these stars

You look good at the house
Good in the car
You're looking so good anywhere you are

Tonight, tonight looks good on you
Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby

I can only imagine what it will be like when I walk by Your side
I can only imagine what my eyes will see when Your face is before me
I can only imagine

Surrounded by Your glory what will my heart feel?
Will I dance for You, Jesus? Or in awe of you be still?
Will I stand in your presence? Or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing Hallelujah? Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine, I can only imagine

I can only imagine when that day comes
And I find myself standing in the Son
I can only imagine when all I will do
Is forever, forever worship You
I can only imagine

Surrounded by Your glory what will my heart feel?
Will I dance for You, Jesus? Or in awe of You be still?
Will I stand in Your presence? Or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing Hallelujah? Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine, I can only imagine

I can only imagine when all I will do
Is forever, forever worship You


I can...
See you over there starin' at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink, all alone tonight
And...
Chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's...
Probably not my place but I'm gonna say it anyway
‘Cause you look like
You...
Haven’t felt the fire, had a little fun
Hadn’t had a smile in a little while, baby


Blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color


I'm not tryna...
Be another just pick you up kinda guy
Tryna drink you up, tryna take you home
But I just...
I don't understand how another man
Can take your sun and turn it ice cold
Well, I've...
Had enough to drink and it's makin' me think
That I just might
Tell you...
If I were a painter I wouldn’t change ya
I’d just paint you bright, baby


'Cause blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color


No, no, no
Mmmm
It ain't your color baby
Mmm, baby


Blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color
Blue ain’t your color


Mmm, no, no, no baby
Come here, baby
Let me light up your world


I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Aren’t who I want to be

But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you


Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you


There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!


God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you


On my own I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo


Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you
He gave me you

Catalogs fillin' up the mailbox
Home shopping on the cable box
And www dot
Oh, there's no escape
Delivery truck coming up 'round the bend
Beep, beep, beep, just backing in
Sign here and here and here again
'Cause it's no money down no payments till
Your whole place is cram packed filed with

Chorus:
Stuff (stuff) stack it on stack it on up

Oh, it's treasure till it's mine then it ain't worth a dime
It's stuff (stuff) spreading like weeds
Dragging me under in an endless sea of stuff

Got to get a bigger place so I can move in
More stuff

It's getting late but it's alright
The get-it-all mart opened up all night
You can catch it all with a quick swipe
It's easier everyday
Suv's and mini vans
Parading 'round in caravans
Toting off more than their tires can stand
'Cause it's no money down no payments till
Every square inch of the whole world's filled with

Chorus:
Stuff (stuff) stack it on stack it on up

Chorus:

Oh, it's treasure till it's mine then it ain't worth a dime
It's stuff (stuff) spreading like weeds
Dragging me under in an endless sea of stuff
(Stuff) There ain't no end
Got to get a bigger place so I can move in
More stuff

More stuff

Never get enough
Stuff (stuff)...

At night she pumps gasoline

Well, they're flicking on the bar lights
Band's playing one last song
And if you want another round
Better order it now
It's last call

Crowd's still rocking
And it's 2:01
The bartender's screaming at the top of his lungs


You don't have to go home
But you can't stay here
You can walk
You can crawl
Get carried off by the law
But you will get the hell out of here

You don't have to go home
You don't have to go home
But you can't stay here


Well, there's a couple hiding out
Getting down in a bathroom stall
And there's a $20 bet
Just waiting on the 8-ball to fall

Everybody's begging
For one last shot
Before they kick our butts into the parking lot


You don't have to go home
But you can't stay here
You can walk
You can crawl
Get carried off by the law
But you will get the hell out of here

You don't have to go home
You don't have to go home
You don't have to go home
You don't have to go home
But you can't stay here

You can walk
You can crawl
Get carried off by the law
But you will get the hell out of here

You don't have to go home
You don't have to go home
You don't have to go home
But you can't stay here

If you were the sun
And one day you lost all your light
And you disappeared
I'd stand in the dark all alone
And wait through the night
And I'd feel no fear
I might not know what to do
But you'd shine again like brand new
I've got that much faith in you

Chorus:
If ever the lights were to go out between us
If ever the raindrops should start to fall
Should the winds of distrust ever rock our foundation
I know we could weather it all
I might not know what to do
But I do know we'd make it through
I've got that much faith in you

And if you were the moon
And one night a big black cloud
Came and covered your face
I'd stand in the rain
Like a statue tall and proud
Till the clouds blew away
I might not know what to do
But you'd make the rain roll on through
I've got that much faith in you

Chorus:

Take back the holly and mistletoe
Silver bells on string
If I wrote a letter to Santa Claus
I would ask for just one thing
I don't need sleigh rides in the snow
Don't want a Christmas that's blue
Take back the tinsel, stockings, and bows
Cause all I want for Christmas is you
I don't need expensive things
They don't matter to me
All that I want, can't be found
Underneath the Christmas tree
You are the angel atop my tree
You are my dream come true
Santa can't bring me what I need
Cause all I want for Christmas is you
I don't need expensive things
They don't matter to me
All that I want, can't be found
Underneath the Christmas tree
You are the angel atop my tree
You are my dream come true(dream come true)
Santa can't bring me what I need
Cause all I want for Christmas is you
Cause all I want for Christmas is you
Cause all I want for Christmas is you

I was 18 making minimum wage
With a letterman's jacket and a chevrolet
Thought I was cool
Yea, I ruled the school
You were cumlada with the strawberry lips
Had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips
Your senior year, and I was your daddy's worst fear

We ran off on graduation night
Thought a couple of left-hand rings would make everything alright

Chorus:
With a little bita live, little bita learn
Little bita watchin' a few more candles burn and
Finding out what life was
Oo with a little bita fuss, little bita fight
Littel bita kiss and makin' up all night and
One day waking up
Oh in a real love

Well I was 22 working double overtime
I was spending dollars and making dimes
We were overdrawn, yea and barely hanging on
Then one night you came to me
With tears in your eyes and an EPT and said
"Guess what? Yea baby ready or not"

I just smiled but I was scared to death
How am I gonna have a kid when I'm still a kid myself?

(CHORUS)
Woah in a real love
Yeah yeah
Its a real love

(CHORUS)
Yeah baby its a real love
Yeah its a real love baby
Yeah its a real, real, real, real, real, real love
Whoa


Been going round and round all day
Bailing some hay and stacking it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town, shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a couple Shiner Bock
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock


Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you


I hope you are wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby that is a good night
Anyone from the heartland is going to understand
What I am talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan


Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, so you can play my radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you
Take a little ride with you
I want to take a little ride with you


Right now we both know
We're Marina Del Ray
Planes gonna fly away
And you'll be on it
And by This Time Tomorrow
I'll be singing Yesterday
The sunshine's gonna fade
And we can't stop it
So before we turn in, I Can't Make You Love Me


Let's be Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline
Freefallin' Small Town Saturday Night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream
Paradise City, where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry
But that's a song for another time


Just for One More Day, What Do You Say?
Baby be my Pretty Woman
Because we know Sunday morning's coming down
Let's take a drive, you and I
Down some old country road
Talk about growing old in one of those Pink Houses
Yeah we might be a Candle in the Wind
But let's pretend we're


Brown Eyed Girl sweet caroline
Free fall small town Saturday night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go dancing on the ceiling
Keep on living that teenage dream
Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon you'll be always on my mind
But that's a song for another time


So before we're singing I will always love you


Let's sing brown eyed girl sweet caroline
Free fall small town Saturday night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go dancing on the ceiling
Keep on living that teenage dream
Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry
But that's a song for another time


Yeah that's a song for another time
(Brown eyed girl sweet caroline)
Yeah, that's a song for another time
(Free fall small town Saturday night)
That's a song for another time

He was raised on a tractor in overalls and boots
Been to college and then law school since leaving his roots
Came home in a Lexus, he left in a Ford
Country ain't country no more

He told his daddy catch up with the times
He said now a days people trade heifers online
Dad ain't sealing deals with a handshake like before
Country ain't country no more
No, country ain't country no more

The back forty was sold to make up for hard times
Then sold by the half acre lot overnight
The houses went up and the trees were cut down
And there went the finest deer hunting around
Lord, everyone's locking their doors
'Cause country ain't country no more

Now his dad sits in traffic looking 'round at the change
Watching crews turn the county road into four lanes
The old Sunday drive has turned into a chore
Country ain't country no more
Lord, country ain't country no more

The back forty was sold to make up for hard times
Then sold by the half acre lot overnight
The houses went up and the trees were cut down
And there went the finest deer hunting around
Lord, everyone's locking their doors
'Cause country ain't country no more

There's no turning back
And you just can't ignore
That country ain't country no more
No, country ain't country no more...

Country certainly isn't country anymore...
Thanks to Kerry. VOTE Bush!!!


Ooh wooh
I need a saving grace
A hiding place
I don't have forever or time to waste
So don't let me be lonely
I want to shake this winter coat off my sleeve
Dust off a record and just be free
Oh don't let me be lonely
No don't let me be lonely


When you're young
You can fly
But we trip on clouds because we get too high
And we grow up
And then it's gone
Oh God only knows what we'll become


So don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh don't let me, let me be lonely


Well the night rolls on like a long lost friend
Until the sunrise bleeds like the bitter end
Don't let me be lonely
Well there's nothing to hide and nothing to prove
Give me all that you are
You've got nothing to lose
Just don't let me be lonely
No don't let me be lonely


So don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh don't let me, let me be lonely
No, don't let me be


When you're young
Life's a dream
It's a beautiful and a burning thing
And we grow up
And then it's gone
But the memory goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on


Don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh don't let me, let me be lonely
Don't let me be lonely
Don't, don't let me be lonely
No, don't let me be
Ooh, lonely


I know I should let it go
Take a different road
When I'm driving home
But I don't want to
Delete your number from my phone
Instead of calling
Asking if you're all alone
But I don't want to


Stay away
From your side of town
But it's too late
I'm in your drive right now


I don't know, why I don't
Put it out baby
We kiss and the flames
Just get higher
But yeah I know
When I hold onto you baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire


Ooo-ooo
I could find a spot to
Go hang out on Friday night
Where you are gonna be
But I don't want to, no
Yeah, I could let it end
Call it quits, call off
All this on and off again
But I just don't want to


Yeah that key
Is right under the mat
Come on in, baby
Let's strike that match


I don't know, why I don't
Put it out baby
We kiss and the flames
Just get higher
But yeah I know
When I hold onto you baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire
Playing with fire


So let's fire it up one more time
(Fire it up one more time)
Baby just put your lips on mine
(Lips on mine)


I don't know, why I don't
Put it out baby
We kiss and the flames
Just get higher
(We kiss and the flames
Just get higher)
But yeah I know
When I hold onto you baby
(Onto you baby)
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
(All tangled up)
(I'm all tangled up)
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
(Give it time)
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
(Sounds crazy)
But guess I like playing with fire
(Playing with fire)
Playing with fire
(Playing with fire)


Playing with fire, huh

All Wrapped Up in Christmas

1st verse
Her mother called and wondered where we were
And why we didn't call her after church
I told her that we had to hurry home
Cause this time of year there's always something going on

1st chorus
We gotta deck the halls
We gotta find that box of broken balls
That angel and that tub of tangled lights
Patch up the tree then fuss about where it oughta be
I hate she missed us but we're all wrapped up in Christmas

2nd verse
Ain't got time to watch a football game
We gotta listen to Bing and Elvis sing
It won't be long til Santa makes his run
I better hurry up and get everything done

2nd chorus
I gotta sign those cards
I gotta get that reindeer in the yard
Hang off the roof and change them burned out bulbs
Gotta spend it all between Wal-Mart and the mall
It could get vicious cause we're all wrapped up in Christmas

Tag
Happy holidays
May joy and peace come your way
Our best wishes


What if i said yes
What if i'd gone out that night
What if you'd turned left
Everything would've turned out alright
What if i'd spoke up
What'd if i'd took the keys
What if i had tried a little harder instead of always trying to please


Joey i'm so sorry
Ohh can you hear me
Joey i'm so sorry


What if i'd said no
What if we'd never fell in love
What if we'd gone slow
Or a little be faster and broken up
Would i know this hurt
Would i feel this pain
Do you know that with all i have left in my very last breath i will call your name




Were you sad
Were you scared
Did you wish for a prayer to be free
Was it quiet and cold
Was it light or too dark to see
And did you reach for me


Joey i'm so sorry
Ohh can you hear me?
Joey i'm so sorry
Oohhhohh can you hear me
Joey i'm so...
Joey i'm so..... Sorry

I made a trip back to my hometown last week
For my grandparent's fifty year annivers'ry
It was black leather wingtips, and big bouffant hair
Your typical senior affair

They were cuttin' the rug to a Glen Miller tune
When someone stood up and tapped a glass with a spoon
It was old Eddie Vicker's granddaddy's best man
And his very best friend to this day
And his eyes grew misty as he raised his champagne

He said, "Here's to the makers of things built to last
Like church bells and bridges, and baseball on grass
Like Ferguson tractors and Lucchese boots
My daddy's old tools I still use

The pledge of allegiance, the stars and the stripes
The words in the Bible, the sun in the sky
And here's to the twinkle in old married eyes
Still there after fifty years past
Here's to the makers of things built to last"

We live in a world now of plastic and glue
Disposable honor, replaceable truth
And if a pot breaks, why fix it? Man, what's the use?
It costs less to buy it brand new

Oh but lately I've looked in the eyes of my wife
And I see there what matters the most in this life
And I have decided I'm takin' a stand
To stay on that fifty year plan
Inspired by the words of a very wise man

He said, "Here's to the makers of things built to last
Like church bells and bridges, and baseball on grass
Like Ferguson tractors and Lucchese boots
My daddy's old tools I still use

The pledge of allegiance, the stars and the stripes
The words in the Bible, the sun in the sky
And here's to the twinkle in old married eyes
Still there after fifty years past
Here's to the makers of things built to last"
Here's to the makers of things built to last

Got a hole in my boots
So I gotta watch where I spit
Every time I chew
Got a hole in my boots

Got a hole in my jeans
Been working so hard
They're about to fall apart
At the seams
I got a hole in my jeans

It's a Friday night
And I'm out on the town
Man you know you're gonna
Find me somewhere

There's a hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm probably in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
There's a hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out

There's a hole in the wall
Where the neon lights
Shine bright as a disco ball
That's my hole in the wall

Well I got a hole in my heart
I can slide right up to some
Pretty little thing at the bar
Pass that hole in my heart

You can pop a top
You can twist that lid
Doesn't really matter
Just as long as you get

That hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm probably in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
That hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out

I don't care if it's from Tennessee
Kentucky or Denver, Colorado
Make it from wheat, make it from corn
I don't really care
Just make it pour

From that hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm probably in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
In that hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out

This is for my people back home
We're lighting one up, feel the love
We wouldn't be here without ya

See this one's for my people
From the backwoods to the steeple
From my daddy and that preacher man
That taught me to run from evil
From the people that I'm still so cool with
And the people that I went to school with
From the boys I ran around and stomped them grounds and broke them rules with
This one's for my family and the way that I was raised
And now my life's another city, another picture, another stage
But I hope you know I miss ya
And part of me's still with ya
And no matter where I go or what I do I won't forget ya

This is for my people back home
We're lighting one up, feel the love
We wouldn't be here without ya

For the one's who took the time to breathe the life in me
You got my heart beating inside of me
You made me what I tried to be
For the one's who love my music
Said you could do it, if you choose this
So we dreamed big and we worked hard
Now we got the whole world cruisin'

This is for my people back home
We're lighting one up, feel the love
We wouldn't be here without ya
This is for my people back home
Mix it strong, pour it out no doubt
We're always thinking about ya

For the one that got away
Damn, I should have kissed her
For my best friends and my cousins
And that town that we grew up in
If it wasn't for all of ya'll
This ole boy would be nothing

You're running through our hearts
You did it from the start
Yeah you know who you are
You're in every song I sing
You're in every dream I dream
You're the beat inside of me

This is for my people back home
We're lighting one up, feel the love
We wouldn't be here without ya
This is for my people back home
Mix it strong, pour it out no doubt
We're always thinking about ya
(Whoa)
Ain't gonna let you down

Just wanna make you proud

Little miss checkered dress

Little miss, big old heart beats wide open and she's ready now for love




Well I'm looking for a Bonnie
Lookin' for a P.I.C
A lil partner in crime
Come hell or high water
She's down
She's ridin with me
Lil miss watch for blue lights
While I drive, you can hold that forty-five
Go down in a blaze of glory
I always loved that story, now


You could be that
You could be that
You could be that girl
And I can see that good girl gone bad
You could be that girl


I bet your daddy said you could be anything
Anything you wanted to be (ha)
Bet he never saw a renegade comin'
You're a lady
You know how to hit your knees
I need a girl who knows the Good Lord
I need a girl that's gonna pray for me
Yeah


You could be that
You could be that
You could be that girl
And I can see that good girl gone bad
You could be that girl


Hot as a pistol
You got that rebel potential
Hop on this ol' moto'cycle
Baby, let's make it official
Let's ride

Little baby girl let's ride


You could be that

You could be that girl
And I can see that good girl gone bad
You could be that girl

Yeah


Yeah you could you be
What I need
Hey baby, you can be y
Yeah, you could be that girl
Yeah, I can see that


Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Cloud of dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cutting cross the sky
I'm rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to


I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession


Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel


I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession


I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
Hope he's moving in the right direction
This is just a moonlight soaked, rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession


You've been wearing that crown and tearing me down
It's been a while since you've treated me right
You strung me along for far too long
Cause I never gave up the fight
Until now


It's gonna hit you hard 'til you see stars
It’s gonna put you through a world of hurt
Oh, I don't believe in getting even
But giving what you deserve
Oh my, oh my, huh


Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la dee da


I don't wanna be your "just for fun"
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
Done


You crossed the line too many times
I'm gonna put you in your place
You play with dynamite, don't be surprised
When I blow up in your face
Oh my, oh my, huh


Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la dee da



I don't wanna be your "just for fun"
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
Done


Done with your selfish ways
Done and all the games you play
I'm through with you and everything you say


Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la dee da


I don't wanna be your "just for fun"
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
Done


Hey, hey, ooh
I wanna be done (so done)
So done (so done)
So done


I've been up to my neck working 6 days a week
Wearing holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
Been dreaming of getting away since I don't know
I am no better time than now for Mexico


No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shirt, no shirt, and no problems!
No problems


Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
Want to look thru my shades and see you there with me
Want to soak up life for a while
In laid back mode
No boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code


No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shirt, no shirt, and no problems!
No problems


Babe lets get packed tank tops and flip flops if you got them
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
No problems


That girl, she's a party all-nighter
A little "Funky Cold Medina,"
Little "Strawberry Wine"-er
That girl, she's a love gunslinger
Neon jägerbomb country-okie singer
That girl, she's a walk on the wild slide
She's a day glow radio slow ride
Low ride good time
If you see her, tell her I'm


Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Hard to find, got me spending every night
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Sundown, heaven town, drivin' 'round
Hitting the bars
Shooting the stars, rollin' up on every party wonderin' where you are
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Drivin' me crazy, something says baby, yeah, maybe you're that girl
That girl, that girl, that girl


That girl she's a sugar sweet drive-by
Hold my dreams in her blue jeans, oh my
Yellowhammer, south Georgia, Mississippi chick
Drink cherry wine, Louisiana lipstick
That girl likes to drink it up real loud
Blowin' smoke in a backroad gravel cloud
Drop it down, summer heat
I've got a sittin' up high Silverado seat


Waitin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Hard to find, got me spending every night
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Sundown, heaven town, drivin' 'round
Hitting the bars
Shooting the stars, rollin' up on every party wonderin' where you are
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Drivin' me crazy, something says baby, yeah, maybe you're that girl


Hair like a field of gold
Body like a honeycomb
Smile like a country song
Baby where you been


That girl, that girl, that girl
That girl, that girl, that girl


Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Hard to find, got me spending every night
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Sundown, heaven town, drivin' 'round
Hitting the bars
Shooting the stars, rollin' up on every party wonderin' where you are

That girl, that girl, that girl
I've been waitin' for that girl


Hair like a field of gold
Body like a honeycomb
Smile like a country song
Baby, climb on in

Hey, this is God
Could I please have your attention
There's a need for intervention
Man, I'm disappointed in what I'm seeing
Yeah, this is God
You fight each other in my name
Treat life like it's a foolish game
I'd say you've got the wrong idea
Oh, all I'm asking for is love
Well, I've seen you hurt yourselves enough
Oh, I've been waiting on a change in you
Yeah, this is God
I've given everything to you
But look at what you do
To the world that I created
This is God
And what's with this attitude and hate
You grow more ignorant with age
You had it made, now look at all you've wasted
Oh, all I'm asking for is love
I've seen you hurt yourselves enough
Oh, I've been waiting on a change in you, yeah
I know your every thought
Your heart and soul and every move
There are so many consequences
To the things you do
All I'm asking for is love
Haven't you hurt yourselves enough
Oh, I've been waiting on a change in you
A change in you, oh
This is God


Starin’ at the prettiest part of this powder keg world
Sittin' with the finest example of a beautiful girl
If we hadn’t hit the brakes, we’d have no idea
Paradise was hiding right here


Dipping our toes in the water
I don’t care if it gets any hotter
It’s you, me rememberin' how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun and mix it with rum
Mmm mmm mm mm


Came out here to do a whole lot of nothing and we’re doing pretty good I think
The only one thing we need to worry about is filling up when the ice cubes clink


Dipping our toes in the water
I don’t care if it gets any hotter
It’s you, me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun and mix it with rum
Mmm mmm mm mm
Mix it with rum mmm mmm mm mm


Lucky folks go to the ocean
The lakes for the land-locked ones
We got a tarp and a truck bed, a kiddie pool, a slip and sled, let that garden hose run


Dipping our toes in the water
I don’t care if it gets any hotter
It’s you and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun and mix it with rum
Mmm mmm mm mm
Mix it with rum mmm mmm mm mm
Mix it with rum mmm mmm mm mm

I could shed my skin and in the blink of an eye I could fly fly fly
Tie my dreams up in a sack and lay my head down on the track and die die die
My life's been so sweet I just can't stand it
I must admit I've made out like a bandit

Last night's conversation with a real good friend of mine drinkin' wine wine wine
Said fifty years of livin' and your worst mistake's forgivin' just a time, time, time
One man's lust for life brings world reknown
And the next guy can't get two feet off the ground... he's earthbound

Earthbound... hear the wind throught the tops of the trees
Earthboound... summer sun nearly ninety degrees
Earthbound... big ol' moon sinking down... think I might stick around
I'm earthbound

I knew love once way back when she had almond eyes and olive skin
And long black hair
She was Irish Spanish mix breed I was southeast Texas hayseed
We were almost there
Her Daddy did not like my kind around
And true love took the next train out of town... earthbound

Earthbound... where there's fathers and daughters in pain
Earthbound... mama's boy walking home in the rain
Earthbound... like a ship run aground think I might stick around
I'm earthbound

With each new day that passes I'm in need of thicker glasses but it's all ok
Someday I'll be leavin' but I just can't help believing that it's not today, hey
Every golden moment I have found
I've done my best to run right in the ground... earthbound

Earthbound... see the sky big and beautiful blue
Earthbound... fallen angels come callin' to you
Earthbound... keepin' close to the ground, think I might stick around

Earthbound... Tom Waits, Aretha Franklin, Mary Karr
Earthbound... Walter Kronkite, Seamus Heaney, Ringo Starr
Earthbound... The Dalai Lahma and Charlie Brown make me wanna stick around
I'm earthbound


Who'd-a guessed that Aqua Net
Could start a fire with a single cigarette
No, she wasn't drunk, she wasn't stoned
Just sick and tired of wondering if he was coming home
So she drove around, she found his car
They heard the boom from in the bar
He called the cops, she called his bluff
They hauled her off in high heels and handcuffs


Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden 'til they're pushed off the deep end
Oh yeah, God forgive 'em, they weren't born like this
Oh no, crazy women are made by crazy men


He told his friends she was depressed
Borderline bipolar, witch with PMS
Well, he cheats and lies and then plays the victim
He don't know why they always seem to pick him


Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden 'til they're pushed off the deep end
Oh yeah, God forgive 'em, they weren't born like this
Oh no, crazy women are made by crazy men


Some take a pistol, some take an axe
And boy, if you feel the fire, you better bet she's got a match
It might be the teacher just down the street
The hairdresser or the housewife or the waitress that's so sweet
No, you won't see it when you meet 'em
So be careful how you treat 'em
She might look just like me


Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden 'til we're pushed off the deep end
Oh yeah, God forgive us, even though some were born like this
God knows, crazy women are made by crazy crazy crazy
Crazy women are made by crazy men

Hey, step aside brother, you're blockin' my view
But let me pretend I'm talkin' to you
(Talkin' to you.)
'Cause I'm lookin' at her, an' I like what I see
No, don't turn around, she's lookin' at me
(Lookin' at me.)
Yeah, she knows I know
Well, you know:

I gotta go before she runs like a fast little filly
She's a five alarm fire, a hot bowl of chilli
An' she's burnin' a hole in this hillbilly
An' I can't let her get away
I gotta say somethin' kinda funny, just a little bit crazy
That'll make her want to think about bein' my baby
'Cause I know what I want and I ain't waitin' all day
So hey, get outta my way

(Na, na na na, na na na na, na na na na.)

I know I drove you here, but, well could you find a ride home?
'Cause I'm a man on a mission, gotta go it alone
(Go it alone.)
Here's a ten for a cab, an' you can finish my beer
'Cause she's into me; I'm into her an' we're outta here
(We're outta here.)
Yeah, she knows I know
Well, c'mon, you know:

I gotta go before she runs like a fast little filly
She's a five alarm fire, a hot bowl of chilli
An' she's burnin' a hole in this hillbilly
An' I can't let her get away
I gotta say somethin' kinda funny, just a little bit crazy
That'll make her want to think about bein' my baby
'Cause I know what I want and I ain't waitin' all day
So hey, get outta my...

Wait a minute, what's she doin' now?
She's puttin' her coat on
Wavin' her keys, lookin' at me:
All right, goodnight, gotta go be...

...fore she runs like a fast little filly
She's a five alarm fire, a hot bowl of chilli
An' she's burnin' a hole in this hillbilly
An' I can't let her get away
I gotta say somethin' kinda funny, just a little bit crazy
That'll make her want to think about bein' my baby
'Cause I know what I want and I ain't waitin' all day
So hey, get outta my way
Ah

Before she runs like a fast little filly
She's a five alarm fire, a hot bowl of chilli
An' she's burnin' a hole in this hillbilly
An' I can't let her get away
I gotta say somethin' kinda funny, just a little bit crazy
That'll make her want to think about bein' my baby
'Cause I know what I want and I ain't waitin' all day
So hey, get outta my way

(Before she runs like a fast little filly,)
(She's a five alarm fire, a hot bowl of chilli,)
(An' she's burnin' a hole in this hillbilly.)
An' I can't let her get away

Telly Man, standin' on a band stand, grand standin' bendin' and bangin' them strings
Eye candy shakin' on a dance floor, sayin' "Play me one more," makin' a scene
Cowboy camped on a bar stool, shootin' double whiskey with a longneck back
And Billy with a pool cue starring down an eight ball, lookin' at Kelly with a rack

Out in the country, back roads and one horse towns
We saw fiddles, play our guitars loud
We talk the talk, and walk the walk
And do the Honky Tonk Stomp

Yeah...Pickups in the parking lot, rockin' like a juke box jumpin' in the July air
Cooler in the tool box, drinkin' every last drop...won't let ya take it in there
Whiskey high, two dudes stumblin' out the back door. Bouncers help 'em take it outside
Through the fussin' and the cussin', & the shovin' and the pushin'...well, it really ain't much of a fight

Out in the country, back roads and one horse towns
We saw fiddles, play our guitars loud
We talk the talk, and walk the walk

Out in the country, back roads and one horse towns
We saw fiddles, play our guitars loud
We talk the talk, and walk the walk

I was never really breathing
My heart was never really beating
Till you held me in your arms
And every love that didn't last
Every second of my past
Simply disappeared into the dark

(chorus)
And with that first kiss I felt my life beginning
And the clock just froze
And the world stopped spinning
Now the magic of that moment is neverending
You made time stand still
And I'm loving every minute

It's the need that never changes
A passion that is ageless
It consumes me like it did when it was new
You have lead me to a place where every day's the same
And I'm always falling more in love with you

(repeat chorus twice)
Oh, and I'm loving every minute
Oh, loving you baby


That old photograph of us sure looks out of place
Layin' on your bag out in the hall
You're takin' it to remind you of our better days
The ones you say you'll miss when you're gone


Don't lie, don't try to fool me
'Cause girl I know what's goin' on
Don't lie, you owe it to me
Believe me, leave well enough alone
So just go ahead and say goodbye
But don't lie


Well, I've seen all his letters in the closet
I've caught a trace of his cologne on you at night
So don't stand there and act so broken-hearted
Tell me how it's killin' you inside


Don't lie, don't try to fool me
'Cause girl I know what's goin' on
Don't lie, you owe it to me
Believe me, leave well enough alone
So just go ahead and say goodbye
But don't lie


Just come out and say it
Don't worry I can take it
Don't you think that I deserve the truth?


Don't lie, don't try to fool me
'Cause girl I know what's goin' on
Don't lie, you owe it to me
Believe me, leave well enough alone
So just go ahead and say goodbye
Girl, just go ahead and say goodbye
But don't lie


Aw, just don't lie


You left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
Cause I can't seem to talk to God without yelling anymore
And when I sit at your piano
I can almost hear those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid


You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith and now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
"Things are only getting worse"
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church


The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it
Cause the faithful man that you loved
Is nowhere to be found
Since they took all that he believed
And laid it in the ground




I still believe in Heaven
And I'm sure you've made it there
But as for me without your love, girl
I don't have a prayer




You left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer

I've texted him twenty-one times
And still my phone don't ring
And my wild imagination, son, is makin' up scary things
Makin' up scary things

No one shares a kiss like that
And then just doesn't call
Last night he promised me the world
And now I'm gettin' nothing at all

He better be dead
His house burnt down to the ground
He better have two wheels hangin' off a crumblin' cliff
Way I'm feelin' now

I swear his head better be pressed up against a gun
After all the things we said
If he still ain't called by now
He better be dead

I don't like being done like this, that just ain't my style
Little boys playin' games
You know they really get me riled
You know they really get me riled

If I weren't getting madder by the minute
Then I'd be worried sick
I know he knows I'm callin'
So what the hell is it?

He better be dead
His house burnt down to the ground
He better have two wheels hangin' off a crumblin' cliff
Way I'm feelin' now

I swear his head better be pressed up against a gun
After all the things we said
If he still ain't called by now
He better be

Dead as a doornail, cold as a stone
Flat on the train track, whoa
Traced on the floor, stiff as a board
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

He better be dead
His house burnt down to the ground
He better have two wheels hangin' off a crumblin' cliff
Way I'm feelin' now

I swear his head better be pressed up against a gun
After all the things we said
If he still ain't called by now

He better be tied to a motel bed
And cuffed, gagged and bound
He better be dead
That boy better be dead

I've texted him twenty-two times
And still my phone don't ring

I took my son to the mall the other day to see Santa Claus
The woman in line behind me says "hey is that Santa Claus up there"?
I said "no ma'm, it's a Kenny Rodgers stunt double"

Here's your sign

The other day I bought a wreath to go on our front door
As I was walking out the store a man stopped me and said
"hey, are you going to hang that on your door"?
I said "no sir, it's a Christmas toilet seat cover, got the idea from Martha Stewart"

Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
You acted dumb, so have some fun and wear your stupid sign
Oh! Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
You lost your mind, so pay the fine and wear your stupid sign

I hung those little Christmas lights on my house, you know the kind that blink on and off
My neighbour comes over and says
"Bill how do you get those to blink on and off like that"?
I said "I've got my son inside plugging and unplugging it, plugging and unplugging it"

Here's your sign

I took my family to buy a Christmas tree the other night
When we walked onto the lot this guy walked up to me and says
"hey, y'all here to buy a Christmas tree?"
I said, "no sir, my son needs to go to the bathroom and these trees looked really inviting"

Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
You acted dumb, so have some fun and wear your stupid sign
Oh! Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
You lost your mind, so pay the fine and wear your stupid sign
Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
Have no fear when you're spreading cheer during Christmas time

The other night my family and I were walking through the neighbourhood looking at all the Christmas decorations
When we came across this house that had a manger scene
Now there was this whole group of people looking at it when I overheard this one guy say
"hey, are those the Three Wise Men"?
I said "no sir that's ZZ Top doing a farming concert

Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
You acted dumb, so have some fun and wear your stupid sign
Oh! Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign
You lost your mind, so pay the fine and wear your stupid sign

Here's your sign, Here's your sign, here's your stupid sign
(have no fear when you're spreading cheer during Christmas time)

And finally my wife and I were in a grocery store the other day and I heard a woman ask the clerk
"do you know what time Midnight Mass starts on Christmas Eve"?
And in the holiday spririt I walked over and said "Here's your sign"

Happy holidays everybody!


I love my boots broke in, I love my camo hat
Don’t mind a little paint on my jeans, yeah I roll like that
I love driving my truck across the railroad track
If you hit it too quick, it’ll hit you right back

I love a fresh cut field with a first frost on
How it shines like gold when the sun turns on
I love the sound of them wheels, my baby singing along
When “Boys Of Summer” comes on


I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol’ dirt road road
Rolling through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man I love this life


I love that county line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays
I love that taste of her lips when she’s been sipping that wine
I still get drunk on her every time


I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol’ dirt road road
Rolling through mind
Man, I love, man I love
Man, I love this life

Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man I live this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
(I love this life, I love this life, I love this life)


I love that ragged old barn that my grandpa made
It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church, out on 109
It’s where I hit my knees and I thanked the Lord for this life of mine


I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol’ dirt road
Rolling through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man, I love this life

Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man I live this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life

Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man I live this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life


She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane


He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'


At a truck stop diner, just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him


He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
Born for leavin'


Well, it's a windin' road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover, I'm a runner
And we go 'round and 'round
And I love you, but I leave you
I don't want you, but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby


Oh, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man
I ain't ever gonna change
I've got a gypsy soul to blame
And I was born for leavin'
Born for leavin'


When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
But I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then

She was singin' "Love Me Tender" at the local karaoke
I knew right then and there I had found my one and only
She takes my breath away everytime I see her
Just couldn't wait for all my boys to meet her
She's got season tickets and sweet pouty lips
She's all that, well equipped

She's all that, she loves to ride in my pickup truck
She's all that, Mom and Daddy can't believe my luck
She's all that, she looks so good we never wait in line
She's all that, she's all mine

She can throw a split finger and she's got her own glove
When she sinks a twenty footer, man I know I'm in love
Saturday night she's like a time bomb tickin'
She looks better on Sunday than Mama's fried chicken
She only gets mad when she missed SportsCenter
She's all that, even tempered

She's all that, she swings a nine handicap
She's all that, she looks sexy in a baseball cap
She's all that, she makes me want to lay it all on the line
She's all that, she's all mine

Whoa she's a perfect combination
Whoa got my defense off the field
Whoa every day's an education
Got my head a spinnin' like a spoke inside a wheel

She's all that, I'm in touch with her feminine side
She's all that, let me tell you man, it's one sweet ride
She's all that, a humdinger,boy, straight off the blocks
She's all that, no doubt about it, the girl rocks
The girl's all that
The girl's all that
The girl's all that
Going home to baby sure is fine
She's all that, she's all mine
She's all that, she's all mine
She's all that

Are you awake; are you asleep?
It's hard to tell with your back to me
Turn around and face me, if you can
Are you afraid what I might see
If you should look at me
Now, tell me about her, if you can

If you can look me in the eye and say we're over
If you can kiss my lips and feel no fire inside
If you can hold me body close and still say you love her most
Then you can walk out of my life, if you can

Everyone makes mistakes; tell me she's the one you made
And I'll forgive, and I'll forget, if you can
Who was right and who was wrong
Doesn't matter if the love is gone
Honey, I'll keep holding on, if you can

If you can look me in the eye and say we're over
If you can kiss my lips and feel no fire inside
If you can hold me body close and still say you love her most
Then you can walk out of my life, if you can
You can walk out of my life, if you can

Mile upon mile got no direction
We're all playing the same game
We're all looking for redemption
We’re just afraid to say the name
So caught up now in pretending
What we're seeking is the truth
I'm just looking for a happy ending
All I'm looking for is you

Chorus

And it came upon me wave on wave
You're the reason I'm still here
Am I the one you were sent to save
And it came upon me wave on wave

I wondered out into the water
And I thought that I might drown
I don’t know what I was after
Just know I was going down
That's when she found me
Not afraid anymore
She said you know I always had you baby
Just waiting for you to find what you were looking for

Repeat Chorus

Wave on wave, wave on wave…

Repeat Chorus

The clouds broke and the angels cried
You ain't gotta walk alone
That's why they put me in your way
And it came upon me wave on wave

Chorus
Repeat Chorus

(Phil Vassar, Julie Wood)

When I hear you stop and laugh out loud
When you're fallin' fast asleep
When you're in the middle of a crowd
When you're lyin' close to me
When I hear you softly say my name
When you're high and when you're low
When you don't need me to explain
'Cause you already know
When you smile that way
I know, every night and day

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

When you're drivin' in your car
When you dance and sing to the radio
When you're walkin' underneath the stars
Anywhere and everywhere you go
When you're dressed up or you're dressed down
When you're talkin' on the phone
With a million people all around
Or when you're all alone
When you're near, or you're far
You're in my heart no matter where you are

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

When you smile that way
I know, every night and day

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

That's when I love you


Leave your dishes in the sink
Leave the ice cubes in your drink
Just come on over
Leave your coat behind the door
Leave your laundry on the floor
Just come on over


I need you now, I need you bad
I need you baby looking just like that
Don't pack a bag, don't make me wait
I wanna kiss that smile that's on your face
I need you wrapped up in these arms
I want you just the way you are
Come on over


Baseball cap and torn up jeans
A pair of flip flops on your feet
Just come on over
Don't slow down, don't stop for gas
Keep those four wheels spinning fast
Just come on over


I need you now, I need you bad
I need you baby looking just like that
Don't pack a bag, don't make me wait
I wanna kiss that smile that's on your face
I need you wrapped up in these arms
I want you just the way you are
Come on over


I need you now, I need you bad
I need you baby looking just like that


Don't pack a bag
Don't make me wait
I wanna kiss that smile that's on your face
Oh all I need is all your love
Baby, I can't get enough
I need you wrapped up in these arms
I want you just the way you are
So come on over
So come on over

(Stacey Dean Campbell/A. Anderson)

Baby, won't you come back home
I'm tired of being all alone
Just sittin' on a barstool
Actin' like a sad fool
Ever since you've been gone

Do I love you
Do I miss you
Honey, I do
Do I cry
Since you've said goodbye
Honey, I do
Honey, I do
Honey, I do

I just put fifty-five dollars away
Just to hear that ol' jukebox play
'Cause I found your favourite love song
Played it all night long
And all I got is heartache

Do I love you
Do I miss you
Honey, I do
Do I cry
Since you've said goodbye
Honey, I do
Honey, I do
Honey, I do

Do I, do I miss you
Honey, I do
Oh, you know I do, honey

I got the honky tonk blues again
This loneliness just won't end
There's your memory
In everything I see
Here it comes again

Do I love you
Do I miss you
Honey, I do
Do I cry
Since you've said goodbye
Honey, I do
Honey, I do
Honey, I do

Do I, do I miss you
Honey, I do
I do, I do
I miss you
I do

Saw a story on the local news last night
About one more struggling single mother
She was talking about how hard it is getting by
With no help, no money, no nothing from the baby's father
Made me think about this guy I know with a wife and a child
Who's working two jobs just to get by
Yeah, he says he'd do anything he could in this world
Just to give his young family a better life; yeah, a better life
Oh, that's a man
That's a 19-year-old, modern-day hero man

Those two young Marines over there fighting for their country
Man, they're gonna be friends forever
They've both come back eventually
But as bonds and destiny would have it
They don't come back together
Yeah, the one who lived to tell about
Why he can't even talk about it
Keeps fighting that fight up there in his head
Ain't a day goes by he don't wonder why
Why it wasn't me instead
It could've been me instead

Oh, that's a man
That's a you don't know how hard he tried to save his buddy's life man
I don't know about you
Sometimes, I just need a little reminder
And reach down and find some understanding
Find some kind of kindness

Read about a man who said his family
Had been farming the same land in Ohio for 100 years
Felt like he'd paid for it ten times over
With his own blood, his own sweat, and his own tears
If he had to, he'd be out there on that tractor working
Seven long, hot days a week
Yeah, he's the kind of feller that people get real quiet
When he stands up in church to speak
They know when he speaks

Oh, that's a man
That's a stand tall, walk straight
Put God's share in the collection plate man
Oh, that's a man

Somethin in the way your movin
Is tellin me that your still crazy for me
Somethin bout' the way your lookin

Cold in the morning and I go crazy living life like this

Somethin bout' the way you move me

Somethin bout' the way im feeling
Is telling me that im not really leavin

Im holding on not letting go
The things that never went away

Holdin on ive got the need to provide you with every living breath

Im cold in the mornin thinking about you
Cold in the evenin when im without you
Cold in the mornin and I go crazy living life like this
Cold in the mornin thinking about you
Cold in the evenin when im without you
Cold in the mornin and I go crazy living life like this

Ohhh take a look inside theres more then just a ghost to find in me

Im cold in the mornin thinking about you
Cold in the evenin when im without you
Cold in the mornin and I go crazy living life like this


When I'm sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
I'm gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today


You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
It just keeps falling and so do I
Well I'm feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today


I don't know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life


I know it won't always be like this
Life could change as quick as a kiss
It's not over yet and I already miss
Today


I don't know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world is right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life


And as the seasons change and time goes bye
When your hair is grey and so is mine
I know for sure that you're gonna be
Just as beautiful as you are to me
Today

Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, right now the whole world is right
Bring on tomorrow


Because a memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

So you say your love's about to end
You say you can't take no more
She's out the door
And your looking for a friend

Who am I to tell you why
But I'm just curious, were you furious
Or did you swallow your pride
And look her in the eye and

Tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
Tell her that you want her to stay
Reassure her with a kiss
She may never know unless you
Show her what your feeling
Tell her you're believing
Even though it's hard to say
'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her
So open up and tell her that you love her

Brother I've been right where you are now
And my heart was broke
'Cause I never spoke
Those healing words out loud

But I've learned my lesson well
And now every night
Before I close my eyes
I look at my woman and
I ask myself did you

Tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
Tell her that you want her to stay
Reassure her with a kiss
She may never know unless you
Show her what your feeling
Tell her you're believing
Even though it's hard to say
'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her
So open up and tell her that you love her

Tell her that you love her

Tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
Tell her that you want her to stay
Reassure her with a kiss
She may never know unless you
Show her what your feeling
Tell her you're believing
Even though it's hard to say
'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her
So open up and tell her that you love her
Tell her that you love her

Baby when I look at you with your hair fallin' down and your baby blues
Standing there across the room I get so lost in the way you move
It makes me reminisce back to years ago on a night like this
Teary eyed as you took my hand and I told you that I'd be your man
So many things have come so many things have gone
One thing that's stayed the same is our love is still growing strong

{Chorus}
Baby just look at us all this time and we're still in love
Something like this just don't exist
Between a backwoods boy and a fairy tale princess
People said it would never work out
Living our dreams has shattered all doubts
It feels good to prove 'em wrong
Living our love song

Oh darling would you look at me
With my heart beating fast and my shaking knees
It's pretty hard to believe after all these years I still need you this badly
You're dancing in my arms with a spotlight moon in a sea of stars
Girl we've come so far everything I want is everything that you are
I just want to lay you down
Say I love you without a sound
I think you know what I'm talking about

{Chorus}

{Chorus}

Feels good to prove 'em wrong
Just living our love song

I’ve never been a “Cool Hand Luke”
The quarterback of the winning team
Or the guy with the right kinda punch-lines
Everybody wants to be
I never was that lucky ol cuss with a straight flush in his hand
Oh, but with you, I am

I ain’t no Patrick Swayze, my old boots never danced on air
Never walked with a swag looking sharp as a tack
Lit up like Time Square
Who’s that guy with a big old smile as wide as the Rio Grande
Oh, with you I am

Strong as an oak, soft like leather
High as a pine and light as a feather
The same ol boy but a whole lot better
Whenever you’re holding my hand
I use to poke fun at them punch drunk lovers
I never thought I’d be that man
Oh but with you I am, Oh baby with you I am

I’ve always been a “do it my way” drifter
Another highway, another town
Never thought about bout that little white house
With a porch all the way around
Yeah I never saw me on a swing talking sweet talking dreams but I’ll be damned
With you I am

Strong as an oak, soft like leather
High as a pine and light as a feather
The same ol boy but a whole lot better
Whenever you’re holding my hand
I use to poke fun at them punch drunk lovers
I never thought I’d be that man
Oh baby with you, I am
Oh baby with you, I am


He said, "I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door"
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me


Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
Opened my eyes and told me the truth."
They said, "Just a little faith, it'll all get better."
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm


Changed
And now I'm stronger


There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water


Well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight


Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
Saying, "God, if you're there come and rescue me."
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm


Changed
And now I'm stronger


There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water


And now I'm singing along to amazing grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
And now I'm stronger


There must be something in the water (Amazing grace)
Oh, there must be something in the water (How sweet the sound)
Oh, there must be something in the water (That saved a wretch)
Oh, there must be something in the water (Like me)
Oh, yeah


(I once was lost)
I am changed
Stronger
(But now I'm found)
Was blind but now I see


Just watching her blonde hair, sun burn, stare at them
Whitecaps rolling over
Laid back in a thrift store beach chair
Dropping limes in her Corona
Well she looks back, yeah, she throws me a kiss
Like "Honey, I sure want you"
And it's a hundred and three between her and me
And only 92 in Daytona


And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, so tight
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh
Beachin'


We got 2-for-1s, we're at a margarita bar
Whatever happens happens
And there's a reggae band, full of dread heads
Just sittin' in the corner laughing
Well my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a jar
She smiles and shakes it at me
Yeah, she gets 'em going, she gets 'em playing
A little, don't worry be happy


And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, so tight
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh
Beachin'


Talking 'bout
Sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, so tight
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh
Beachin'


Sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, so tight
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand

I heard so many times
You've got to take love slow
That's just something said
BY unsure people who don't know
What it's like to fall
When you fall with all your heart
Wanting to be together every second you're apart
They must not know what it feels, to feel like this
Longing for each moment
Waiting for each kiss

CHORUS
I could never love you enough
I could never hold you too tight
Never give too much of my heart
Never spend too many nights
With my arms just wrapped around you
And a million stars above
Baby, I still can't believe I found you
I could never love you
Never love you enough

Seems like the time we're given
Always goes too fast
Before I know it, with you girl
The future is the past
Second turn to hours
The hours turn to days
Seems like you're always leaving
When I'm wanting you to stay
'Cause I could spend the rest of my life with you mine
And still it'd only feel like a few seconds in time

CHORUS
I could never love you enough
I could never hold you too tight
Never give too much of my heart
Never spend too many nights
With my arms just wrapped around you
And a million stars above
Baby, I still can't believe I found you
I could never love you
Never love you enough

I could never love you enough
I could never hold you too tight
Never give too much of my heart
Never spend too many nights
With my arms just wrapped around you
Underneath a million stars above
Baby, I still can't believe I found you
I could never love you
Never love you enough

I could never love you enough


It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor’s sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget


I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that


Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Coming from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory


I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that


Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away


I had a barbecue stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don’t forget, no a heart don’t forget
I said a heart don’t forget something like that
Oh, not something like that

I'm lookin' at a busy bartender
There's one man party goin' one
I'm sittin' here nursin' a longneck beer
Tryin' to forget you're gone
And I've got a fresh roll of quarters
For an all night honky tonk sound
It keeps me singin' a different tune
So the bottle won't let me down

Drinkin' songs and other logic get me over you
If there's a bullet I can dodge it with a shot of ninety proof
With the jukebox now in session and Haggard ringin' true
Drinkin' songs and other logic get me through

It's a good life here in the nightlife
Bedin' in the neon glow
The bartender, me and the kings of country
Playin' everythin' we know
The Red headed stanger's smokin'
He burned a hole in his guitar
And I'm drowin' in a whisky river
Lord, that's a-runnin' right through this bar

Drinkin' songs and other logic get me over you
If there's a bullet I can dodge it with a shot of ninety proof
With the jukebox now in session and Willie ringin' true
Drinkin' songs and other logic get me through

Oh, lonesome me, I'm walkin' floors, hello walls, and swingin' doors
Your cheatin' heart, you done me wrong, and the list goes on and on

Drinkin' songs and other logic get me over you
If there's a bullet I can dodge it with a shot of ninety proof
With the jukebox now in session and the music ringin' true
Drinkin' songs and other logic get me through
Drinkin' songs and other logic get me through


She's sick of this town, she's sick of that boy
Yeah she's sick of dreams that never take flight
There's gotta be more than the same old story
So she's gonna turn the page tonight
And turn the radio up (turn the radio up)
Roll the windows down
She got a full tank of gas (she got a full tank of gas)
Ain't no stopping her now


She's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do
Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes
Are leaving nothing in that rearview
But dust, nothing but dust


She's fighting back tears, she's fighting back years
Of the only life she's ever known
There's a future that's bright in the dead of this night
And all she's gotta do is go
And turn the radio up (turn the radio up)
Roll the windows down
She got an open road (she got an open road)
Ain't no stopping her now


She's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do
Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes
Are leaving nothing in that rearview
But dust, nothing but dust


She got the radio up
She got the windows down
No she won't look back
Ain't no stopping her
Ain't no stopping her now…


She's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do
Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes
Are leaving nothing in that rearview
But dust, nothing but dust


Yea I like to run with the old dogs
Learned some bad habits from my Paw Paw
I got an in with the outlaws
An I can only sing like I talk Ya'll
I like to smoke from my left hand
Crank it out, stomp in a bar band
Firing up another when the song ends
And hangin' out here with my new friends...Cause


I'm the son of the son of the south
Daddy redneck mama half hippie
Taught how to talk straight not back or my little white butt get a whippin'
I like catfish coockin on a creek bank kind you can't find in the city ya'll
I ain't just whistling dixie


Well I ain't scared of a shotgun
Folks around here we all got one
Don't give a damn or a dadgum
If ya don't like where I come from
I like a girl from a down home
Even better without a thing on
Jump in ya better hang on
Fire it up an' were long gone...cause




Whistling dixie


I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says


Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again


I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said


Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again


I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song


'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again


I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

That first kiss shook me up
It rattled my cage
With a tender touch
Sweet and Wild
Girl I could not get enough
The grass was cool
We lost our minds
Sharing secrets and a bottle of wine
Lazy night
Cotton dress
Givin in to a warm caress
Sweet and Wild girl I could not get enough
Sweet and Wild
Taste of your love

Taste of your love
Gentle on my mind
Taste of your love
Sweet and wildest berries from a summer vine

I know the stars
Saw the spark
Hopes and dreams
Tangled in the dark
Sweet and Wild
Taste of your love

Taste of your love
Gentle on my mind
Taste of your love
Sweet and wildest berries from a summer vine

Every breathe fan the flame
Your warm body drove me insane
And though its been years and miles
See that fire flicker in your smile
Sweet and wild girl I still can't get enough
Sweet and wild boy I still can't get enough
Sweet and wild taste of your love

Oooooooooooo oooo ooooo
Sweet and wild oooo
Oooooooooo ooooo ooo
Sweet and wild taste of your love
Ooooooooo ooo oooo
Sweet and wild yea yea


I’m a blackjack label
You’re a classic glass of red
So girl watcha doing here tonight?
Messing up my bed


You don’t really love me
You just think that you do
I’m just a phase, you’re going through


Someday soon baby
You’re gonna wake up and see
There ain’t ever gonna be
A forever for you and me

Someday soon baby
You’re gonna look back and smile
That you got hooked, on a guy like me
For a little while


'Cause I’m a Friday night'er
You’re a Sunday afternoon
I’m a reckless rock and roll'r
You’re a last slow dance to a midnight tune


Deep in your heart I know
You know I ain’t right for you
I’m just a phase, you’re going through
Yeah-eh


Someday soon baby
You’re gonna wake up and see
There ain’t ever gonna be
A forever for you and me
Yeah-eh

Someday soon baby
You’re gonna look back and smile
That you got hooked on a guy like me
For a little while


I guess I might be crazy
For loving life
But baby until the last kiss
From your lips tells me goodbye


I’m gonna lay right here
And pretend that it ain’t true
I’m just a phase, you’re going through


Yeah, I’m just a phase
You’re going through
Girl I’m just a phase
You’re going through


I'm a dirt road in the headlights
I'm a mama's boy, I'm a fist fight
Kinda county line, kinda cold beer
Little hat down, little John Deere

I kinda don't care
You see that girl standing right there


She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy

I'm turning it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me


She likes my T-shirt
She likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance to some old school
She'll take a full moon over those city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah, I can smooth it out
I can stick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough of


A small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl

Yeah, she loves a small town boy like me


I never had no one, that I could count on
I've been let down so many times
And I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life
It was a feeling, I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone


You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah


You stand by me, and you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy, you're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble, when we touch
And, oh, the look in your eyes, when we make love


You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend, ooh-oh oh
You're my best friend


You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend (my best friend)
You're my best friend (my best friend)


Why did she have to go
So young I just don't know why
Things happen half the time
Without reason, without rhyme
Lovely, sweet young woman
Daughter, wife and mother
Makes no sense to me
I just have to believe


She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me


Loved ones she left behind
Just tryin' to survive
And understand the why
Feelin' so lost inside
Anger shot straight at God
Then askin' for His love
Empty with disbelief
Just hopin' that maybe


She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me


It's hard to say goodbye
Her picture in my mind
Will always be of times I'll cherish
And I won't cry 'cause


She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me


Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me


Raymond's in his Sunday best, he's usually up to his chest
In oil and grease
There's the Martin's walking in, with that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week


Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off-key in the pew behind me


That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home, into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday


I stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the Sunday Times
Grab a coffee cup
It looks like Sally and Ron, finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time


It's thirty-five cents off of ground round, baby, cut that coupon out


That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-napping on the porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
And steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah


Ooh, new believers getting baptized
Momma's hands raised up high
Ain't it a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah


That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah


Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?


Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was


Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking


By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?


Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was


Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking]


When a mountain of a man with a "born to kill" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-sliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking, oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... cause I was


Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking


To kiss and tell, it's just not my style
But the night is young, and it's been awhile and she broke my heart, broke it right in two
And it took some time but I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to find, find somebody new


I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl


It's that moment when you start closing in
First you're holding back, then surrendering
It can start a fire, light up the sky, such a simple thing
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?


I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl


'Cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah
Are you ready? Are you ready..to cross that line, put your lips on mine??
(Put your lips on mine baby)
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?


I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely, I shouldn't be lonely


I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

When a preacher talks of heaven, he paints it real nice
He says, you better get to livin', better get to livin' right
If you're gonna get your mansion, he's been saving for your soul
If you're gonna do your dancing on city streets of gold

But unless it's got a dirt road leading down to a fishing hole
With a little piece of moonlight, a couple cans of Bud Light
Where I can cuddle with my baby and I can pull her real close
No, I don't wanna go unless heaven's got a dirt road

You better quit your drinking, you better quit your smoking too
Be for trading in your backseat Saturday nights for Sunday morning pew
Well, I've never been nothing, nothing more than what you see
Like my truck, I'm made for running, down to a midnight creek

So unless it's got a dirt road leading down to a fishing hole
With a little piece of moonlight, a couple cans of Bud Light
Where I can cuddle with my baby and I can pull her real close
No, I don't wanna go unless heaven's got a dirt road

All of this flying high, gonna leave ya falling short
Leave you knock, knock, knocking on heaven's basement door
But one thing's for sure

Unless it's got a dirt road leading down to a fishing hole
With a little piece of moonlight, a couple cans of Bud Light
Where I can cuddle with my baby and I can pull her real close
No, I don't wanna go unless heaven's got a dirt road

All the guys have gone blind from starin'
My baby, she ain't even carin'
And they're crazy if they think i'm sharin'
'Cause i know what they're after
And nobody else can have her 'cause she's

Chorus:
My girl, a walkin' talkin' angel baby
My girl, not a minute goes by when she ain't looking pretty
My girl, a 24-7 piece of heaven
God never made another in this world
Quite like my girl

Oh, oh, quite like my girl

Her eyes are shining like big blue diamonds
It's a look of love, ain't no denying
When i kiss her lips, i feel like flying
Man, she's somthin' else
And i've got her all to myself cause she's

Chorus

The way she moves, the way she grooves
You know she drives me wild with her wild-child smile
Planets align when she's holdin' me tight
Blowing my mind, it's such a ride
I can't get enough

Chorus

Oh oh, quite like my girl
Oh yeah, she's lookin' pretty

My girl, a walkin' talkin' angel baby
My girl Ooh yeah, she's lookin' pretty
My girl, a walkin' talkin' angel baby
My girl, Ooh yeah, she's lookin' pretty.....

Where do I start?
Lying on a blanket underneath the stars
With your head on my chest
I always liked that best

I hate how times flies
I still think back sometimes
'Bout your lips on my neck
I always liked that best

That time we took a ride
Ended up down by the river side
Soft touch, wet kiss
I always liked that best

I like the way you used to hold me
I like the way you came to know me
You came to know me well, well, well

Falling to sleep
Wearing your shirt 'cause it smelled so sweet
Who could forget
I always liked that best

Or losing my heart
Every time you sang to me on your guitar
'Lady In Red'
I always liked that best

I like the way you used to hold me
I like the way you came to know me
You came to know me well, well, well

I could go on
So many things I miss now that you're gone
Your love, oh yes
I always liked that best

You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down
You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space


But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say, "I'm just another fool and this is just another song"
But I know how you are 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again


But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know


And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me


But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know


You got a way of calling right at the wrong time
I know your southern drawl is what trouble sounds like
The way you got me grinning
You know I'll climb up in your rusty truck
I give up, come on over pick me up


Back roads no lines, high beam headlights
Baby you just might make me lose my mind


You slide me over little love shootin' shotgun
Hands out the window, got my toes up on the dash
Nothing but fields on the wheels just slinging red mud
I like the way you drive, just like a rebel child
You make me wanna get barefoot and buckwild


You're showin' off in circles down by the riverside
You like to make me nervous so I move in real tight
Come on throw it in park
I wanna see the stars and feel the grass between my toes
Dancing to the radio


Oh ,you got me where you want me
Lost in the country


You slide me over little love shootin' shotgun
Hands out the window, got my toes up on the dash
Nothing but fields on the wheels just slinging red mud
I like the way you drive, just like a rebel child
You make me wanna get barefoot and buckwild


I don't know how you do what you do
But you do what you do and it does what it does to me
I can't stop it once you start it


You slide me over little love shootin' shotgun
Hands out the window, got my toes up on the dash
Nothing but fields on the wheels just slinging red mud
I like the way you drive, just like a rebel child
You make me wanna get


Wild, wild, barefoot and buckwild
Wild, wild, barefoot and buckwild
Barefoot and buckwild


I never knew there were such great movies
On tv at 3 am
I'd never guessed that at midnight tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl
But these days i'm all turned around
There's only one thing i'm sure of right now


I should be sleeping
'stead of keeping
These late hours i've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
Even though i'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still i know i
Should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you


I never knew that i was funny
'til i went and made you laugh
Never liked a girl to call me honey
But you did and i liked that
I keep thinking about your smile
Trying to read between the lines
Looks like i'll be up for a while




After just three dates
And one great kiss
It's way too soon
To be obsessing like this




Dreaming about you
I should be sleeping
Dreaming about you
Well, i'm dreaming about you
Yeah

I was sittin' at the bar with my buddies, discussin' the state of the world
Everyone had an opinion
Then somebody turned and asked Earl
Is the stock market gonna recover, or will it wind up in the tank?
He looked down in his glass of bourbon, he
Said, "I lover her, she hates me, I drink."

Wall Street don't run out by my house
I don't put much stock in their game
Just three things in this world concern me
I love her, she hates, and I drink

Well, he went back to minding his memories
For awhile there we left him alone
We went back to minding our business
And the Cowboys and Packers came on
Bill tapped old Earl on his shoulder
He asked, "Who do you like in this game?"
He said,"For me the game's over
I love her, she hates me, and I drink

You can count on a winner and a loser
What I think don't change a damn thing
Just three things in this world concern me
I love her, she hates me, and I drink

Yeah, Wall Street don't run out by my house
It's a far cry from memory lane
Just three things in this world concern me
I love her. God she hates me. I drink


Ever since you were a little girl
Your daddy told you, "you could run the world"
I knew it when we met that day
When you were sitting in the corner sippin' earl gray
You had the sweetest dreams in your eyes
That burn with the fire chasing sunset skies
As much as I wanted to hold you, I couldn't hold you back


There's no stopping you
'Cause your mind's set to
Where your heart says "go"
Go on, go girl, go
Hope you find me in a stranger's smile
Hope you hear me in the lonely miles
You gotta do what you were born to do
'Cause there's no stopping you


As you're looking out the window when you board a train
When you take a sip, do you say my name?
When you get lost on the silver coast
Will you stop for a minute and dance with my ghost?
In the flowers on the streets of Rome
Do you catch a scent of my cologne?
Just when I think you might wanna come back home


There's no stopping you
'Cause your mind's set to
Where your heart says "go"
Go on, go girl, go
Hope you find me in a stranger's smile
Hope you hear me in the lonely miles
You gotta do what you were born to do
'Cause there's no stopping you


Sometimes I see you
When no one's there
And the wind blows through
Your golden hair
Whiskey burn
And the records spin
I pray that you'll come back again
But until then
Until then


There's no stopping you
'Cause your mind's set to
Where your heart says "go"
Go on, go girl, go
Hope you find me in a stranger's smile
Hope you hear me in the lonely miles
You gotta do what you were born to do
'Cause there's no stopping you


No stopping you
No stopping you


Creek goes rippling by
I've been barefoot and all day with my baby
Brown leaves have started falling
Leading the way


I like it best just like this
Doing nothing all the way
So let's lay down in the tall grass
Dreaming away


And all I wanna do is let it be and be with you
And watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me go on forever
Like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only
You and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by


Girl, you know you told me not so long ago
To let it come, then let it pass
And all your troubles and your sorrows
They won't last


So let me kiss you now, little darling
Beneath this autumn moon
Cold wind, another season
Will be here soon


And all I wanna do is let it be and be with you
And watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me go on forever
Like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only
You and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by


There ain't nothing that can't be done
By me and God
Ain't nobody gonna come in between me and God
One day we'll live together
Where the angels trod
Me and God
Early in the morning talking it over
Me and God
Late at night talking it over
Me and God
You could say we're like two peas in a pod
Me and God


He's my Father
He's my friend
The beginning
And the end
He rules the world
With a staff and rod
We're a team
Me and God


I am weak and he is strong
Me and God
He forgives me when I'm wrong
Me and God
He's the one I lean on
When life gets hard
Me and God




He rules the world
With a staff and rod
We're a team
Me and God
We're a team
Me and God

Ya ever feel like you're standing in glue
Going nowhere, yeah man, me too
Busting your butt just trying to get ahead
Wind up tasting a little dust instead
Buddy, I swear that pretty thing of mine
Don't ask for much but I'd be lyin'
If I said, I didn't want to give her everything that shines

Cold beer conversations
Just a couple old boys, a little time well wasted
Trying to figure out life
Trying to figure out girls
Trying to find our place in this crazy old world
A little truth, a little frustration
Cold beer conversation

Man, don't you miss those Friday night lights?
Wouldn't you like to bust through that paper one more time?
Brother, my folks are gettin' up there in years
Momma still thinks the devil's in here
Now tell me buddy, don't you ever wish
We could work a little less, catch a few more fish?
Yeah, maybe one day when we both strike it rich

Cold beer conversations
Just a couple old boys, a little time well wasted
Trying to figure out life
Trying to figure out girls
Trying to find our place in this crazy old world
A little truth, a little frustration
Cold beer conversation

We could sit here all night trying to make it make sense
A little buzz is probably all we're gonna get
But that's alright

Cold beer conversations
Just a couple old boys, a little time well wasted
Trying to figure out life
Trying to figure out girls
Trying to find our place in this crazy old world
A little truth, a little frustration
It's just us man, go on and say it
Cold beer conversation


The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming
Is just about as blue as it gets
And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset
You ain't seen red
Texas sunflower yellow
Can take your breath away
I've seen it all, from the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer but my favorite color is


Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on


The buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon
The sun can do the job in the daytime
But the moon ain't quite bright enough
To light up the way to playtime
For people like us
Just like a beach side beacon
Callin' all the ships back home
A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
The windows are tinted that's why they invented


Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on


It's the buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is always neon
You know I've seen it all
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer
But my favorite color is


Neon, the light they always leave on
Put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon


I don't need a whole lot of money
But I wouldn't turn a lottery down
I just need a little green in my pocket
So I can buy my buddies a round
All I want is a place to lay my head with the woman I love lyin' in my bed
Kind of understated
My dreams aren't that complicated


I wanna be the one
When all is said and done
Who lived a good life, loved a good wife
And always helped someone in trouble
On the day they lay me down
I want everyone to gather ‘round
And say he was a father, brother, neighbour and a friend
He was a good man!


I used to dream of being a rock star
And seein' the world in style
Used to dream of havin' a fast car
And driving that miracle mile
But I've heard tales those streets aren't paved in gold
They're full of pot holes and empty souls
Who never learn…
Love is something you gotta earn




When I'm gone, I wanna leave a legacy
Of love and laughs and honesty behind me
Behind me




Yaaaaa…I wanna be a good man…a father
A brother, a neighbour, and a friend
I wanna be a good man!


I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Going 95, burning down 129, yeah
Looking for the law, while I push my luck
She's riding shotgun like it ain't no thing

Pull into the party like "y'all wassup?"

I ain’t rich, but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day, ain’t working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that’d kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can’t buy happiness

But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I’m sure that’s probably true
But it still sounds pretty cool

‘Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

To float down on the water with a beer…
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting’ on a hundred mill…
Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reel…

And it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some Silver Bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat
It could buy me a boat

This small town ain't such a bad little place
It's home but I could sure use some place
City limit signs are closing in on me
There's times I swear I can hardly breathe

I'm gonna pack my bags, say my good-byes
Get a map and close my eyes
Point my finger, let fate decide
Where I'm gonna land
I'm gonna hitch my wagon to a wandering star
A guy like me can sure get far
With a little gas and a credit card
Now that's a plan
Yeah that's a plan

These dirt roads all look the same
I wanna see the world from a faster lane
And I know for a while I'm gonna be big news
But life will get back like it was real soon

I'm gonna pack my bags, say my good-byes
Get a map and close my eyes
Point my finger, let fate decide
Where I'm gonna land
I'm gonna hitch my wagon to a wandering star
A guy like me can sure get far
With a little gas and a credit card
Now that's a plan
Yeah that's a plan

Well I'm sure I'll come back here once again
When I finally settle down but till then

I'm gonna pack my bags, say my good-byes
Get a map and close my eyes
Point my finger, let fate decide
Where I'm gonna land
I'm gonna hitch my wagon to a wandering star
A guy like me can sure get far
With a little gas and a credit card
Now that's a plan
Yeah that's a plan

Now that's a plan


There you are in the early light of day
There you are in the quiet words I pray
I've been blessed by the simple happiness
Of the perfect love we've made


Every time I turn around
When I'm lost and when I'm found
Like an angel standing guard
There you are
Every time I take a breath
And when I forget to breathe
You're watching over me
There you are


When I'm looking for the light
In the middle of the night
Searching for the brightest star
There you are


There you are in standing in a crowded room
There you are the earth and I'm the moon
My desire is to stand by the fire
That burns inside of you






There you are
There you are


Daddy's been a back-row Baptist
With his share of front-row sin
His Saturday night still on his breath
Every Sunday when he'd walk in
He's never led the Benediction
He's never sang in the choir
But he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire


Mama lives by the Bible
The Bible lives by the bed
And she's lied alone so many nights
With scriptures in her head
Praying Good Lord, just be with him
I know his faith is tired
But he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire


And I know he lives a little left of living right
And he's come close to going way too far a few times
But I'd trade a thousand prayers
If just one prayer would come true
Lord, please believe in him like I believe in you


Daddy's always been there for me
From T-Ball to touchdowns
Fixed my car an' fixed my heart
When they've been broken down
I know he calls for more forgiveness
Than most folks do require
But he's an angel with no halo
An' one wing in the fire


And I know he lives a little left of living right
And he's come close to going way too far a few times
But I'd trade a thousand prayers
If just one prayer would come true
Lord, please believe in him like I believe in you


Well, I just can't imagine
What Heaven might be like
If me and Mama make it
Without Daddy by our side
Lord, could you please remember
When it's time to call us higher
That he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire


Your suitcase is gone, with all of your things
Our old picture frames are empty
I burned all your letters, I took off your ring
But what can I do with these memories
Keeping me up 'til the dawn, hanging on like you're coming back
But you ain't coming back


So tell me why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
I try try, baby, try, baby, try
But your love just won't leave me alone
I can't stop the hurt, numb the pain
Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
Why, baby, why?


I close my eyes when I kiss his lips
Praying this time I will see you
I'm real good at lying to everyone else
But I just can't lie to myself
When the truth is a shadow that follows me
Haunting me just like a ghost, if you're just a ghost


So tell me why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
I try try, baby, try, baby, try
But your love just won't leave me alone
I can't stop the hurt, numb the pain
Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
Why, baby, why?


I saw your taillights fade into the dark
And my head knows but there's no convincing my heart


So tell me why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
I try try, baby, try, baby, try
But your love just won't leave me alone
I can't stop the hurt, numb the pain
Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
Why, baby, why?


Friday, payday, Lordy, got to get away
Had it with the wife thing, living on a shoe string
What's a poor girl got to do just to have some fun?
Well, all these years without any help
Guess what, honey, clothes just don't wash themselves!
Neither do dishes, neither does the bathroom floor


So, now if anyone asks, not that they would
I'll be down in Mississippi and up to no good


No more, what a bore, had enough, I'm out the door
Headed for a breakdown, had it with the small town
Going to call Lisa, going to call Carla Sue
Now we're going to let it roll, going to let it rip
Going to get us a nice room down on the strip
Not that we'll need it, there won't be any sleeping tonight




Hammer down, here we go
Running for the riverboat
All you're going to see is asses and elbows
Luck's about to change for these three queens
Tired of getting jokers, deal us up kings

Snake eyes, roll the dice, double down and hit me twice
Cashing in the big chips, going to leave a big tip
Hotter than a two dollar pistol, baby, I'm on fire




Well I drank a lot of whiskey in my time
And I've held a lot of women that were fine
And I made a little money, I blew every dime
Tryin' to untangle my mind
Well I've made a lot of choices that were wrong
That the good lord spend too many nights alone
And I've been out on the edge, and I've stumbled 'cross the line
Tryin' to untangle my mind


So if you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's lookin' high
I'm just trying to untangle my mind


Well, I do what I do and I don't know why
But I do what I do, til' the day I die
No heartache for the ticket
So I guess I'll pay the fine
Tryin' to untangle my mind


If you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's lookin' high
I'm just tryin' to untangle my mind
Yes I'm tryin' to untangle my mind


Whoever said that love is easy, must has never been in love
Sometimes its a land mine, one wrong step and it blows up
A word, a look, lights a hidden fuse
It's hard to see just what you have when you're seeing red;
And it's easy to do something that you know you both will regret;
Better stop, think, count to ten before I leave


One, I still wanna hate you
Two, three, I still wanna leave
Four, searching for that door
Five, then I look into your eyes
Six, take a deep breath
Seven, take a step back
Eight, nine, I don't know why, we even started this fight
By the time I get to ten, I'm right back in your arms again


Words thrown so carelessly like weapons when we fight
But when they cut too deep, I wanna leave it all behind
That I've to count to ten, before I cross that line


One, I still wanna hate you
Two, three, I still wanna leave
Four, searching for that door
Five, then I look into your eyes
Six, take a deep breath
Seven, take a step back
Eight, nine, I don't know why, we even started this fight
By the time I get to ten, I'm right back in your arms again


You can lose what you're not thankful for
I don't want that to happen to you and me
Better count my blessing


One, you still move me
Two, three, you send chills right through me
Four, you keep me wanting more
Five, when I look into your eyes
Six, you're my best friend
Seven, that will never end
Eight, nine, I don't know why
But thank God it happens every-time
By the time I get to ten
By the time I get to ten
I can see how blessed I've been


I'd choose you all over again


Sometimes we fight
'Bout who's wrong and right
And stay up all night
And sometimes we drink
And say hurtful things
That we don't mean

Yeah, we're both screaming
But nobody's listening
Let's take this madness out of the kitchen


Come to bed
Let's just lay down
There's just one way
We're gonna work this out

Forget what I did
Forget what you said
Oh, darling
Come to bed


Well, I love you
You know I do
And you love me too

So let's just stop
Remember what we've got
Before it all gets lost

Just take my hand
It's been way too long
Turn out the lights
And turn each other on




And let's put aside our prideful feelings
For tonight
In the morning
We'll see things in a different light




If I never think about her, I'll never miss her at all
Never wonder what she's doin', never give her a call
Never see her again and I'll be free as a bird
But the trouble with never is never never works


If I never bring her flowers, I'll never see her smile
If I never try to kiss her, she'll never drive me wild
And I'll never feel the need to say those three little words
But the trouble with never is never never works


I know how to stay carefree
Let no one get a hold on me
But I can't keep my hands off her
There's something different 'bout this girl


If I never let me love her, I'll never settle down
And I'll never put roots in this God forsaken town
And I'll never say I do or step foot in a church
But the trouble with never is never never works


I know how to stay carefree
Let no one get a hold on me
But I can't keep my hands off her
There's something different 'bout this girl


If I never think about her, I'll never miss her at all
Never wonder what she's doing, never give her a call
Never see her again, and I'll be free as a bird
Oh, But the trouble with never is never never works
Yeah, But the trouble with never is never never works
At least not with her

What stations are the buttons on your radio on
Do you sleep late Saturdays or get up at dawn
Do you prefer fiddles or violins
And have you given any thoughts to how a lifetime of love begins

I want to know everything there is to know
About what turns you on what you like and what you don't
Tell me all your secrets, all your hopes and wishes too
I want to be everything you ever want
So I'm gonna need something to go on
I mean to make your every dream come true
So I want to know everything there is to know about you

Do you like walking underneath the moonlight
Is there some kind of magic that'll make the mood right
How many kisses, how many stars
I'm determined to keep trying 'til I find the way to your heart

I want to know everything there is to know
About what turns you on what you like and what you don't
Tell me all your secrets, all your hopes and wishes too
I want to be everything you ever want
So I'm gonna need something to go on
I mean to make your every dream come true
So I want to know everything there is to know about you

The serious stuff and the light-hearted
I look in your eyes and I'm just getting started

I want to know everything there is to know
About what turns you on what you like and what you don't
Tell me all your secrets, all your hopes and wishes too
I want to be everything you ever want
So I'm gonna need something to go on
I mean to make your every dream come true
So I want to know everything there is to know about you

Well, I want to know everything there is to know about you

There's a lot of ways of sayin' what I wanna say to you
There's songs and poems and promises and dreams
That might come true, But I won't talk of starry skies or
Moonlight on the ground, I'll come right out and tell you
I'd just love to lay you down

(CHORUS)
Lay you down & softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down & tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh Darlin' how I'd love to lay you down

There's so many ways your sweet love's made this house into a home
You've got a way of doin' little things that turn me on
Like standin' in the kitchen, in your faded cotton gown, with your
Hair all up in curlers, I'd still love to lay you down

(REPEAT CHORUS)
When a whole lot of Decembers are showin' in your face
Your auburn hair has faded and silver takes it's place
You'll be just a lovely, and I'll still be around, and if I can I know
That I'd still love to lay you down

(REPEAT CHORUS)
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down & tell you all the things my woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh Darlin' how I'd love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down & tell you all the things my woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh Darlin' how I'd love to lay you down


I'm gonna do it darlin'
I could waste time tryin' to figure it out
But I'm jumpin' in anyhow
I've never been this far
Didn't know love could run so deep
Didn't know I'd lose this much sleep


Holdin' you close, chasin' that moon
Spendin' all night
Lovin' just who you are
Sparks flyin' in the dark
Shootin' out lights, runnin' down dreams
Figurin' out what love really means
Baby, givin' you my heart
Is a real fine place to start


Somethin' is goin' on
I can't explain but sure can touch
It's callin' both of us
Stronger than any fear or doubt
It's changin' everything I see
It's changin' you, it's changin' me




Right here, right now's the perfect spot, the perfect time
The perfect moment when your skin is next to mine




Yeah, yeah
Holdin' you close, (Holdin' you close.)
Chasin' that moon. (Chasin' that moon.)
Spendin' all night
Lovin' just who you are
Sparks flyin' in the dark
Shootin' out lights, (Shootin' down lights.)
Runnin' down dreams, (Runnin' down dreams.)
Figurin' out just what love really means
Baby, givin' you my heart's a real fine place
Real fine place to start
Oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh

At the ripe old age of nineteen
I bought a short bed pick up chicks machine
Life ran on beer and gasoline
A half a lap ahead of the law
I had a fake I d that got me into "tuffies"
Love was a word I used to get lucky
Was a big time spender with that plastic money
Back when I knew it all

Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

I found out credit cards don't mean you're rich
And beer and gasoline don't mix
Yeah step side trucks can't jump a ditch
And those "big house" rooms sure are small
I've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down
A sunday sermon can turn life around
Man I can't believe all the answers I've found
Since, back when I knew it all

Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

I've done some growing up
And I'm still growing up
So I know I'll never be
As smart as I once was
That was back

Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

Bells will be ringing
The glad, glad news
Oh, what a Christmas
To end the blues
My baby's gone
I have no friends
To wish me greetings
Ooh, once again

Choirs
Will be singing
Silent Night
Christmas carols
By candlelight
Please come home
For Christmas
Please come home
For Christmas
If not for Christmas
By New Year's night

Friends and relations
Send salutations
Sure as the stars
Shine above
This is Christmas
Yeah, Christmas my dear
The time of year
To be with the one
You love

So won't you tell me
You'll never more roam
Christmas and New Years
Will find you home
Please come home
For Christmas
Please come home
For Christmas
If not for Christmas
By New Year's night

There'll be
No more sorrow
No grief and pain
And I'll be happy
Happy once again

Just Got Started Lovin You
(James Otto / Jim Femino / D. Vincent Williams)
You dont have to go now honey
Call and tell em you wont be in today
Baby there aint nothin at the office
So important it cant wait
Im thankful for the weekend
But two days in heaven just aint gonna do
This is gonna take forever darlin
Girl I just got started lovin you
Whats the point in fightin what were feelin
We both know well never win
Aint this what were missin
Lets just stop all this resistin and give in
Let me wrap my arms around you
You know you dont want to leave this room
Come back and let me hold you darlin
Girl I just got started lovin you
What can I say Ive never felt this way
Girl youre like a dream come true
After all the love weve made
It sure would be a shame
If we let this moment end so soon
So wont you lay back down beside me
Girl just like I know youre wantin to
Trust me when I tell you darlin
Girl I just got started lovin you
Im thankful for the weekend
But two days in heaven just aint gonna do
This is gonna take forever darlin
Girl I just got started lovin you
Come back and let me hold you darlin
Girl I just got started lovin you

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

Baby's just a little bit tired of the city
Billboards and bullshit got her down
Seem like you need a little hill country
A little back roads driving, little bit of the old top down

Yeah, everybody gotta get away sometime
Forget about yourself for awhile
Seems to me that all you need is a ragtop car to ride with me
Ok, alright, just might get a little high tonight
Ok, alright, carry on

Ol' Walt Wilkins lives up in Nashville
You know his eyes have seen the miles
Walt why don't you jump in Jim T's caddy
Come down to Texas and drink with me awhile

Yeah, everybody gotta get away sometime
Forget about yourself for awhile
Will go down to El Arroyo
Have some tacos and beer yeah and let ourselves go
Ok, alright
Just might try to get a ride tonight
I'm okay, I'm alright, carry on

Life will make sure that you got your troubles
Life will make sure that you work too hard
Ain't nobody that don't get tired
Watching troubles pile up big in your own backyard
Sometimes you've got to grab your world with your own two hands
Set it spinning off on a course all your own
Take yourself a big bag for your shoulder
Find yourself some good times, bring them on back home

Yeah, everybody gotta get away sometime
Forget about yourself for awhile
Lay your whole life upon a shelf
Got no one to blame but your own damn self
Ok, alright, heaven only know what gonna happen tonight
Ok, alright, I'm ok, I'm alright
I'm ok, I'm alright
I'm ok, I'm alright
Oh carry on, yeah

Once I had a fortune ridin' on the shoe
Of a field goal kicker from LSU
I never broke a sweat
Hell, it was just a bet

Now, I've climbed mountains
And jumped from planes
Even played chicken
With a couple trains
Lord, I've been a fool,I still kept my cool

I don't mind admittin' this heart a mine
Starts to pound thinkin' bout

The day my son starts askin' me
All about my history
The things I don't want him to know
The sex, the drugs, and rock-n-roll
Or the first time I watched my daughter
Climb in some boy's car as I holler
"Honey, don't be late"
I swallow hard while they drive away
How sad my life without my wife would be
Now that scares me

This mornin' while I combed my hair
I found a few stray grays in there
And I laughed out loud
I guess I ain't that proud

Some people are afraid to die
But me and Jesus get along all right
I'll be okay cause my judgement day
Will be

The day my son starts askin' me
All about my history
The things I don't want him to know
The sex, the drugs, and rock-n-roll
On the night I walked my daughter
Down the aisle in a stiff white collar
Just a view, they'll say
But who gives this girl away
And leave her standin' while I find my seat
Now that scares me

The things I don't want him to know
The sex, the drugs, and rock-n-roll
And the day they call another house their home
I'm hopin' they find everything that they need
How sad my life without my wife would be
Now that scares me
Oh, that scares me


They say "Love is more precious than gold"
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire


I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire


When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say "That boy is sure livin' in luxury"
Sweet luxury


'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire




When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire


'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire


Suppose I called you up tonight
And told you that I love you
And suppose I said I wanna come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too
And would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say...


I told you so
Oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so
But you had to go
Now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again


If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old time feeling?
Would we laugh and talk for hours?
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that you've missed me too
And that you've been so lonely?
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever
And that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?


Would you say I told you so
Oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so
But you had to go
Now I found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again


Now I found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

Sitting here tonight by the fire light
It reminds me i already have more than I should
I don't need a thing no one to know my name
CHOURS
At the end of the day lord I pray I have a life that's good
Two arms around me,heavenly grounding and a
Family that always calls me home
Four wheels to get there
Enough ghost love to share and a
Sweet sweet sweet song
CHOURS
At the end of the day Lord I pray I have a life that's good

Ooh yeah

You think roses are a waste of time
'Cause in three days, they'll just wilt up and die
We want 'em anyway
Yeah, it's a girl thing

You think we're pretty, at the break of dawn
When we wake up without make up on
We turn the other way
Hey, it's a girl thing

We love romance and candle lights
You like a cold beer, we like a fine wine
You hardly talk, we can talk all night
You wanna fix it, and we just wanna cry
It's a girl thing, it's a girl thing

We're impulsive, but you think it's cute
'Cause the last thing we need is a new pair of shoes
We got a closet full
Yeah, it's a girl thing

We say be honest, does my butt look fat?
You say the same thing no matter how much we ask
'Cause you ain't no fool
Yeah, you know it's a girl thing

We love romance and candle lights
You like a cold beer, we like a fine wine
You hardly talk, we can talk all night
You wanna fix it, and we just wanna cry

You wanna go dancing, we think it's kinda sweet
When you step on her toes with your two left feet
Turn the radio up when our song comes on
We just can't help but sing along

It's a girl thing
It's a girl thing
Yeah

We love weddings and diamond rings
You want a girlfriend, but you don't want strings
We want a four course meal, you want Hooters wings
A football game on the plasma screen

We love romance and candle lights
You like a cold beer, we like a fine wine
You hardly talk, we can talk all night
You wanna fix it, and we just wanna cry

It's a girl thing, yeah yeah
It's a girl thing, yeah yeah
Boys, it's a girl thing, yeah yeah
It's a girl thing


(You got what it takes you can win)


You got what it takes you can win
Today is your day to begin
Don't give up here, don't you quit
The moment is now, this is it
I know that you can then you will
Get to the top of the hill
Part of the fun is the climb
You just gotta make up your mind


That today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, today, today, today


When somebody throws sticks and stones
All they can break are your bones
And life's going to kick you around
Then kick you again when you're down


That today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, today, today, today


Life's going to kick
It's going to kick you around
It's going to kick you down


Brush yourself up, no regrets
This is as good as it gets
Don't expect more or less
Just go out and give it your best


That today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, today, today, today


Today is your day

Billy Joe McAlester junior showed up at the reunion
Clean cut shaved decked out in Armani's best
In perfect spoken english he said now days I go by William
And he talked about his new life and money he'd made out West
And he tried his hardest not to be that old boy we all new
Til he pulled out that Earnhardt wallet on that chain hooked to his belt loop

You can't hide redneck beneath a three piece suit
No starched white collar is gonna keep it from bleeding through
You might as well forget it it's gonna find it's way out
You can't hide redneck you might as well be proud

Well the last we all seen of Sandy she'd moved up to Boston
Law school paid off made her a Federal judge
Scotty had to go and ask her if she still hates John since she lost him
She said 'John who, oh yeah no I don't hold a grudge'
And her honor stayed as professional as long as she could
As the time went on she lit into John just like we all knew she would

You can't hide redneck behind a big old job
A big old cherry wood desk sure ain't no camoflage
You might as well forget it it's gonna find it's way out
You can't hide redneck

You can't hide redneck
In a big old growd
You're gonna blow our cover can't keep us from getting loud

You might as well forget it it's gonna find it's way out
You can't hide redneck you might as well be proud

Might as well be proud

The tall weeds lay flat down
On the hard flat Kansas ground
And a sad song in her head
Kept blowin' round

She barely even knew his name
But she liked the way he played the game
Everybody cheered
When he scored that last touchdown...

Indian Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer

Tangled in a moment of truth
Bottle of wine in a motel room
Blue haze circled 'round
The cold gray moon

While the wind chased the leaves outside
Passion found a place to hide
Late September heat
Couldn't be denied

Oh Indian Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer

She never even finished school
People like to talk, they can be so cruel
Heard California was a place
To start brand new

So she left that dust bowl town
Sometimes when a long wind howls
I wonder where we'd be
If I never scored that last
Touchdown

Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer

I can feel the battle waitin' on your lips with every kiss
It just don't feel like it used to
Late at night, when I hold you tight, something's just not right
There's a distance between me and you
Like I never knew
And it scares me to death to ask what's wrong
But if I'm about to lose you, baby, just go on…

And kill me now
You might as well go ahead and just lay me down
If you're really leaving heaven take me now
'Cause I wouldn't want to live without having you around
If that's what's going down
Baby, just kill me now

Lately you've been changing everything I love about you
It's like you're slowly fading
When the telephone rings I hear whispering from the other room
And my mind just goes crazy
Wondering, baby
Everyday is just another day growing apart from you
So if it's over just do what you gotta do…

And kill me now
You might as well go ahead and just lay me down
If you're really leaving heaven take me now
'Cause I wouldn't want to live without having you around
If that's what's going down
Baby, just kill me now

If you're already too far gone
To turn around
Have mercy on my heart…

And kill me now
You might as well go ahead and just lay me down
If you're really leaving heaven take me now
'Cause I wouldn't want to live without having you around
If that's what going down
If that's what going down
Baby, just kill me now
Baby, just kill me now


She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preaching the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money


Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now


I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me


I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends for forever
And I'd always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late


And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away


I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me


Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I wish her the best now


So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
Yeah, she gonna get married
But she ain't gonna marry me
Whoa, but she ain't gonna marry me, no


I need a red
To smoke that long week straight out of my head
Until there's nothing left
A shot of patron
To kick this good time off
Get it going strong
Baby pour it on


Slip on out where the weekend lives
Put a Friday night hurt on a bottle of fifth
Getting gone to the song's that the midnight's playing
Put a little way out underneath these boots
Kick that switch to what we do
Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust
Yeah turning dirt to dust


Yeah, I need you baby, right there with me
Love that way you make me wanna lose it, go crazy
You know it gets me girl, when you dance like that
You know it kills me girl, with your hands like that
Thinking 'bout it, don't wanna go another minute without it


Slip on out where the weekend lives
Put a Friday night hurt on a bottle of fifth
Getting gone to the song's that the midnight's playing
Put a little way out underneath these boots
Kick that switch to what we do
Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust
Yeah turning dirt to dust


You know it gets me girl, when you dance like that
You know it kills me girl, with your hands like that
Thinking 'bout it, don't wanna go another minute without it

Yeah turning dirt to dust


Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust
Yeah turning dirt to dust
Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust


I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
I'm goin' up
I'm goin' up, up, up, up


It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way
Yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothing's coming easily


Even my skin is acting weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots
Not play connect the dots
I just wanna disappear


Up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up
There's no way but up from here


Even something as simple as
Forgetting to fill up on gas
There ain't no explanation why
Things like that can make you cry
Just gotta learn to have a laugh


Up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up
There's no way but up from here


Oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


When everything is goin' wrong
Don't worry, it won't last for long
Yeah, it's all gonna come around
Don't go let it get you down
You gotta keep on holding on


It's about as bad as it could be (bad as it could be)
Seems everybody's bugging me (everybody's bugging me)
Like nothing wants to go my way
Yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothings coming easily
Oh, oh, oh, oh


And up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up
There's no way but up from here
Up, up, up, oooh

Up, up, up, up, I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
Ohhh


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah ye yeah

I wish you love
And happiness
I guess I wish
You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do
And go and fall in love with someone like you

Cause if you fell
Oh, like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But a kid don't know
He could only guess
How hard it is
To wish you happiness

Well I guess love
Is like a Christmas card
You decorate a tree
And throw it in the yard
It decays and dies
And the snowmen melt
Well I knew love
I knew how love felt

I knew love
Oh, and love knew me
When I walked around, love walked with me
But I got no hate
And I got no pride
But I got so much love that I cannot hide

So you drive a Chevy
So you drive a Ford
So you drive around all night till you just get bored
Then you change your mind
For something else to do
Then your heart changes your mind and it changes you

I wish you love
And happiness
I guess I wish
You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do
And go and fall in love with someone like you

If you fell
Oh, like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But a kid don't know
He could only guess
How hard it is
To wish you happiness
How hard it is
To wish you happiness


She walks to school with the lunch she packed
Nobody knows what she's holdin' back
Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with linen and lace


The teacher wonders, but she doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearin' the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born


Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel


Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbours hear, but they turn out the light
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When mornin' comes it'll be too late


Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel


A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot


Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel

Wake up, what you been dreaming about
I ain't got a lot to say, but I could talk to you for hours
The way you talk, the way that you breathe
The way that your spirit moves into me
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

I got three days to wash the road out of my soul
I got three days to love you out of control
And I wish I had a lifetime to hold onto you this way
Love can do some healing in just three days

Yeah, and hold me and help me understand
Why on Earth I have to be such a stupid man
To live the way I do, dream the dreams I dream
So far away from you, yeah
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

I got three days to wash the road out of my soul
I got three days to love you out of control
And I wish I had a lifetime to hold onto this way
Love can do some healing in just three days

Three days and nights to put some life back in this man
I ain't holding nothing back
You got all I am
Hearts and souls and dreams in the palm of your hand

I got three days to wash the road out of my soul
I got three days to love you out of control
And I wish I had a lifetime to hold onto you this way
Love can do some healing in just three days

I got three days to wash the road out of my soul
I got three days to love you out of control
And I wish I had a lifetime to hold onto you this way
Love can do some healing in just three days


I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl


I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry


This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"


Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be


She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you)


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said "speak now"


Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)


I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you


I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
(Hehe!)


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"


And you say
"Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door"
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
"Speak now"


Been running this highway like a greyhound
Ain't nothing left for me to see
And sometimes I just wish that I could break down
And get on back to you and me
Take the next flight and leave this crazy life
Get back home in time to kiss you goodnight


And whoa oh oh, lately all I think about
Whoa oh oh, is what we could be doing now
Whoa oh oh, baby
Here I go again
Missing you crazy, yeah


Sitting here listening to your sweet voice
Talking on the telephone
It's making me realize, I ain't got no choice
Between staying here and getting gone
I'm gonna say good-bye
Yeah I'm gonna fly
Get these arms of mine back where they belong


Whoa oh oh, lately all I think about
Whoa oh oh, is what we could be doing now
Whoa oh oh, baby
Here I go again
Missing you crazy, yeah


And whoa oh oh, lately all I think about
Whoa oh oh, is what we could be doing now
Whoa oh oh, baby, here I go again
Whoa oh oh, baby, here I go again
Missing you crazy, yeah yeah
Missing you crazy, mmmm

All week long she loves to stay at home and hold me
She hangs her buckle in the closet
Keeps her boots up on the shelf
Heaven knows the Good Lord sent me an angel
But every saturday night she wants to raise a little hell

Chorus
She like kickin' up a little sawdust on her halo
Yeah she'll whirl and twirl and twist and turn
While the jukebox twangs and moans
When she paints on them tight bluejeans
It brings out the devil in me
She likes kickin' up a little sawdust on her halo

You can find her in a choir loft every sunday
Winkin' at me with two sore feet inside her high heel shoes
Every saturday night she'll dance till closin' time
And still be there in the mornin' for sunday school

Chorus

Chorus (2)

She likes kickin' up a little sawdust on her halo


A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher
Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searching for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
And eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime


There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take
When you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go


That farmer left a harvest, a home and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom
In the minds of lots of children:
Did her best to give 'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered:
"Can't you see the Promised Land?"
As he laid his blood-stained bible
In that hooker's hand


There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take
When you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go


That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained bible up
For all of us to see
He said: "Bless the farmer, and the teacher, an' the preacher;
Who gave this Bible to my mamma
Who read it to me."


There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go


There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway


Using a fake ID at a college bar
Getting caught with a girl in the backseat of a car
Running out on the field for the senior game wearing number 17
There's a last time for everything


Like a George Strait cassette in a Pontiac
Or telling Supercuts, "Let's leave it long in the back"
Wearing a tux in a high school gym
And she's wearing your class ring
There's a last time for everything


Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
'Cause there's a last time for everything


Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had
Spending all day on the lake with your grandad
Watching Glenn Frey sing "Already Gone" at the Forum in LA
There's a last time for everything


Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
Cause there's a last time for everything


Kissing goodbye on her porch and driving away
Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came
There's a last time for everything


Biscuits and gravy at your momma's house
(Last time for everything)
Spring break on a fold out couch
(Last time for everything)
Little Jimmy on the Opry stage
(Last time for everything)
Hearing Prince sing "Purple Rain"
(Last time for everything)
(Last time for everything)


If words could make it real
I'd tell you how I feel
Instead I'm waiting here on my knees love
I know how it feels to breathe
With you beside me
I think about it always


Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm waiting for
Waiting for the night
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm waiting for
Waiting for


A lifetime for a day
Would be an even trade
No price I wouldn't pay
For your heart love
I know how it feels to breath
With you beside me
I think about it always




Tonight, tonight, tonight

I swear I gave up drinkin';
Sometimes I have no choice
After singin' hard, six nights straight
A little sip sure helps my voice
Don't get me wrong, I love these songs
An' I know I've got it made
Sometimes my mind starts driftin'
When I'm up here on the stage

To that last half-mile of dirt road
An' that oak tree on the hill
To those dogs out, barkin' in the yard
An' that tractor in the field
An' them kids up on the front porch
Screamin': "Mamma, Daddy's home!"
When I'm out here, I'm just thinkin'
About the things I miss the most

Yeah, the hardest bthing I have to do
Is hang up this telephone
There's so much left to talk about
An' I been gone so long
So put them kids on one more time
Before they go to sleep
And, baby, no, no matter where I go
All that I can see

Is that last half-mile of dirt road
An' that oak tree on the hill
To those dogs out, barkin' in the yard
An' that tractor in the field
An' them kids up on the front porch
Screamin': "Mamma, Daddy's home!"
When I'm out here, I'm just thinkin'
About the things I miss the most

The things I miss the most
The things I miss the most
An' it's killin'me:
I hate to leave this family that you've given me
God only knows, I hate to go
So hold me close and let me let you know
About the things I miss the most

Instrumental Break

People always ask me
After every show
"Of all the places that you've ever been
"What's your favorite place to go?"

It's that last half-mile of dirt road
An' that oak tree on the hill
An' those dogs out, barkin' in the yard
An' that ol' tractor in the field
An' them kids up on the front porch
Screamin': "Mamma, Daddy's home!"
When I'm out here, I'm just thinkin'
'Bout the things I miss the most

While I'm out here, I'm just thinkin'
About the things I miss the most


I put a "For Sale" sign on the front of my truck
Said, "Call any time, I'm always up"
Make an offer
One that I won't refuse
I bought a one-way ticket on a westbound plane
4 hours later
I was wearing shades in California
Yeah, just hanging loose
I didn't pack one memory
And even though I breathe


I can go where I wanna go
Do what I wanna do
Be who I wanna be
But baby
You still own me


Say what I wanna say
Hear what I wanna hear
Dream what I wanna dream
But baby
You still own me


I was up all night
'Cause I couldn't sleep
Instead of staring at the ceiling
I hit the beach, took a long walk
It didn't help me much
I sat down in the sand
With a handful of shells
Kicked off my shoes
While me, myself, and I watched the sun come up
Looking out across the sea
Oh, it finally dawned on me


I can go where I wanna go
Do what I wanna do
Be who I wanna be
But baby
You still own me


Say what I wanna say
Hear what I wanna hear
Dream what I wanna dream
But baby
You still own me


Baby I'm not in your arms
You still own me
But you're still in my heart






Oh yeah... alright
You still own me


Yeah!


I hit the ground running with the morning sun
When a job needs doing, I get it done
I show up early and I go home late
Everybody knows I pull my weight


'Cause I don't mind doing
A little heavy lifting
I'm always giving
My everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kicking
I'll be sticking to the heavy lifting


Well, baby, I hurt, he done me wrong
The going got tough and got gone
Well, he aren’t here and I aren’t him
And even if the walls come fallen in


You know I don't mind doing
A little heavy lifting
I'm always giving
My everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kicking
I'll be sticking to the heavy lifting
Yeah


Baby, when your heart is aching
Lean on me, my back aren’t breaking
All I'm saying is


I don't mind doing
A little heavy lifting
I'm always giving
My everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kicking
I'll be sticking to the heavy lifting


Honey, I aren’t quitting
I'm always giving
My everything


Yeah


As long as I'm still alive and kicking
I'll be sticking to the heavy lifting
Yeah


You and me were sitting in the kitchen
6 PM, should I make a reservation?
No, let's stay home
Cause I'm good with pancakes for dinner
I'm in your t-shirt and we're playing Lynyrd Skynyrd
Oh, let's stay home


Baby turn the lights down low
We ain't got no place to go
Turn on the stereo
Barefoot, dance with me now, dance with me now
Turn on the disco ball
Kiss me up against the wall
Laughing so hard we fall
Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low
Take it real, take it real, take it real slow
Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low


Run a bath and pop a little champagne
I, I love the way we celebrate
Oh, cause you know
That I'm good with watching old movies
Playing footsie, ah underneath the sheets
Oh, let's go-o-woah


Baby turn the lights down low
We ain't got no place to go
Turn on the stereo
Barefoot, dance with me now, dance with me now
Turn on the disco ball
Kiss me up against the wall
Laughing so hard we fall
Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low
Take it real, take it real, take it real slow
Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low


Don't need to take me downtown
We're having this fun when no one's around
We know what happens here
When the lights go down, lights go down
The lights go down, the lights go down


Baby turn the lights down low
We ain't got no place to go
Turn on the stereo
Barefoot, dance with me now, dance with me now
Turn on the disco ball
Kiss me up against the wall
Laughing so hard we fall
Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low
Take it real, take it real, take it real slow
Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low
Take it real, take it real, take it real slow
Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low, oh, yeah, yeah

Your sister's waiting outside
And that horn keeps blowing
You say you can't go home
Without knowing, where we're going
And crying
Saying there's no use trying
You took off your ring
Got your bags all packed
We both said some things
That we can't take back
But I'm no quitter
Baby stop and reconsider

We could call it quits
Wash our hands of this
And just move on down the road
But goodbye is the wrong way
Goodbye is the wrong way
Goodbye is the wrong way to go

Well we've come so far
And it's such a shame
To be pointing fingers
And placing blame
Baby calm down
I still love you
We can turn this around
Anything worth having
Is worth fighting for
I just can't stand here
While you walk out the door
If you stay the night
I know we can make this work out right

We could call it quits
Wash our hands of this
And just move on down the road
But goodbye is the wrong way
Goodbye is the wrong way


City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling
Of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear


Silver bells
Silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling
Hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas Day


Strings of streetlights, even stoplights
Blink of bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear


Silver bells
Silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas Day


Oh
Oh
Oh
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear




Everything to know about me
Is written on this page
A number you can reach me
My social and my age
Yes, I served in the army
It's where I learned to shoot
Eighteen months in the desert
Pourin' sand out of my boots


No, I've never been convicted of a crime
I could start this job at any time


I got a strong back, steel toes, rarely call in sick
A good truck, what I don't know I catch on real quick
I work weekends, if I have to, nights and holidays
Give you forty and then some, whatever it takes


Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up


I put Robert down as a reference
He's known me all my life
We attend the same church
He introduced me to my wife
Gave my last job everything
Before it headed south
Took the shoes off of my children's feet
The food out of their mouths
Yesterday my folks offered to help
But they're barely gettin' by themselves


I got a strong back, steel toes, rarely call in sick
A good truck, what I don't know I catch on real quick
I work weekends, if I have to, nights and holidays
Give you forty and then some, whatever it takes


Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up


I'm sure a hundred others have applied
Rumor has it you're only takin' five


I got a strong back, steel toes, I'm handy with a wrench
There's nothin' I can't drive, nothin' I can't fix
I work sunup to sundown
Ain't too proud to sweep the floors
Bank has started callin'
And the wolves are at my door
Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up


Daddy hugs his little man, says son I've got to go
And he pulls out of the drive and disappears
As they walk back in the house, the young boy asks his mama
Where does daddy go when he leaves here


Mama tells her little man, your daddy's got a job
And when he goes to work they pay him for his time
Well the young boy gets to thinkin', and he heads up to his bedroom
Comes runnin' back with a quarter and four dimes


And says mama how much time will this buy me
Is it enough to take me fishing or throw a football in the street
If I'm a little short then how much more does daddy need
To spend some time with me


The young boy tells his mama, now I know daddy's busy
'Cause most times when he gets home it's dark outside
But tell him I've got me some pennies, saved up from the tooth fairy
And I keep 'em in my piggy bank and I believe there's thirty-five


And mama how much time will that buy me
Is it enough to take me campin', in a tent down by the creek
If I'm a little short then how much more does daddy need
To spend some time with me


Mama how much time will this buy me
Is it enough for just an afternoon, a day or a whole week
If I'm a little short then how much more does daddy need
To spend some time with me


Mama takes her little man, sets him on her lap
And starts dialin' up some numbers on the phone
She says daddy come home early, you don't have to chase that dollar
'Cause your little man has got one here at home

My love for you has spread across
My every move, my every thought
Like a fire the wind has caught
As I begin
To give you all of who I am
Your every touch is my command
When once again it seems
I've loved you all I can

Even then my heart will pound
So loud the world will hear the sound
Of how I couldn't love you more
And even then
Each night will bring another day
Another chance for me to say
Your arms are all I'm living for and loving in
And even then the farthest star
Will find us anywhere we are
I will love you till the end
And even then

I won't know how to tell you this
But I will say with every kiss
No man has ever loved like this
Or will again
And when your auburn hair turns gray
And there are lines across your face
That map each moment and each place
Our love has been

Even then my heart will pound
So loud the world will hear the sound
Of how I couldn't love you more
And even then
Each night will bring another day
Another chance for me to say
Your arms are all I'm living for and loving in
And even then the farthest star
Will find us anywhere we are
I will love you till the end
And even then

Yes I will love you till the end
And even then


The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby


Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby


You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby


There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it
And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain
The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby


You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby


You can find me where the music meets the ocean
If you get the notion
Stop on by and play a while
A simple tune to get your love light glowing
Keep your heart wide open
Disappear just like the tide
Let it roll on by


And jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby


The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
Island lullaby


Say it's nothing but girl I saw you
Turn away and dry your eyes
Sit down beside me and let me hold you
We've got nothing to hide


Anything that touches you, touches me
Anything that's a part of you is a part of me too
Anything that makes you laugh or makes you cry
I wanna know down deep inside what you're going through
Everything you feel, I feel it too
Anything that touches you


Sad old movies, good time places
Perfect memories, favorite songs
Things I say and things I shouldn't
Days gone right or wrong


Anything that touches you, touches me
Anything that's a part of you is a part of me too
Anything that makes you laugh or makes you cry
I wanna know down deep inside what you're going through
Everything you feel, I feel it too
Anything that touches you


No dream too big, no tear too small
Baby I wanna share it all


Anything that touches you, touches me, touches me
Anything that's a part of you is a part of me too
Anything that makes you laugh or makes you cry
I wanna know down deep inside what you're going through
I just wanna pour my heart into
Anything that touches you

Old people make me cry
Goodbyes make me drink
Tom Petty makes me drive too fast
The Bible makes me think
Children make me laugh
My Momma makes me wanna treat a lady right
Like Daddy always has
You make me wanna buy a rose
You make me wanna shine my shoes
Baby, you make me wanna dance
Better than I do
You make me wanna be a man
Who makes you laugh and makes you cry
I wanna be everything you need
You make me wanna make you love me
Girl I'm not poetry
I'm not the finest wine
But I'll toast to you and me
And I'll try to make you rhyme
I'll learn your favorite song
Stand in the yard with my guitar
And sing outside your window all night long
You make me wanna buy a rose
You make me wanna shine my shoes
Baby, you make me wanna dance
Better than I do
You make me wanna be a man
Who makes you laugh and makes you cry
I wanna be everything you need
You make me wanna make you love me
Oh yeah
You make me wanna buy a ring
You make me wanna put you first
You make me wanna talk to God
Even when I'm not in Church
You make me wanna be a man
Who makes you laugh and makes you cry
I Wanna be everything you need
You make me wanna make you love me
Oh yeah
You make me wanna make you love me


To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun
"I'm on Fire" and "Born to Run"
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Ooohh

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark

Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen

Woah-oh-oh-oh

Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Woah Springsteen

Woah-oh-oh-oh


I can hear the neighbors
They're arguing' again
And there hasn't been peace on our street
Since who knows when
I don't mean to listen in
But the shouting' is so loud
I turn up the radio to drown it out
And silently I say a little prayer


But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God


I can see that old man
He's walking past our door
And I've been told that he's rich
But he seems so poor
Cause no one comes to call on him
And his phone it never rings
He wanders through his empty home
Surrounded by his things
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do


But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God


I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
Oh Lord I'd be lost


Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

Flat tire on the interstate;
Too many nights of workin' too late
Had a run in with an old memory
No, it ain't been the best of weeks

But it goes good with beer and the Friday night atmosphere
Of this cross-town bar where the cars all get steered to
And it goes hand-and-hand with my crazy buddies and this three-piece band
And the pretty girls and the games we play, and the smoke and mirrors:
Yeah, troubles come, but they go good with beer
Yeah, it does, yeah

Bring all your debts and all your bills;
Load up your mountains and your molehills
Come as you ain't or as you are
An' don't forget that broken heart

Oh, it goes good with beer and the Friday night atmosphere
Of this cross-town bar where the cars all get steered to
And it goes hand-and-hand with my crazy buddies and this three-piece band
An' the pretty girls and the games we play, and the smoke and mirrors:
Yeah, troubles come, but they go good with beer
Yee haw, oh, yeah

Bring all those stories you can share
Just like the peanuts and the pretzels on the table there

Yeah, it all goes good with beer and the Friday night atmosphere
And the pretty girls and the games we play, and the smoke and mirrors:
Yeah, troubles come, but they go...

Good with beer and the Friday night atmosphere
Of this cross-town bar where the cars all get steered to
And they go hand-and-hand with my crazy buddies and this three-piece band
An' the pretty girls and the games we play, and the smoke and mirrors

Yeah, it all goes good with beer and the Friday night atmosphere
Of this cross-town bar where the cars all get steered to
And it goes hand-and-hand with my crazy buddies and this ten-piece band
An' the pretty girls and the games we play, and the smoke and mirrors:
Yeah, troubles come, but they go good with beer

Pass me them peanuts brother

Shhhhhhh

Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again

And it's like you haven't been
Gone a moment from my side
Like the tears were never cried
Like the hands of time are holding you and me

And with all my heart I'm sure
We're closer than we ever were
I don't have to hear or see
I've got all the proof I need
There are more than angels watching over me
I believe, oh I believe

Now when you die your life goes on
It doesn't end here when you're gone
Every soul is filled with light
It never ends and if I'm right
Our love can even reach across eternity
I believe, oh I believe

Forever, you're a part of me
Forever, in the heart of me
I will hold you even longer if I can
Oh the people who don't see the most
See that I believe in ghosts
And if that makes me crazy, then I am
'Cause I believe

Oh, I believe
There are more than angels watching over me
I believe, oh I believe

Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again
And I believe

"in by Metallizepp"

Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down
Through the night
Two hearts are thrillin' in spite of the
Chill in weather
Love knows no season
Love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open
We're walkin' and hopin' together

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?"
We'll say, "No, man"
But you can do the job while you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
When it snows ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

I remember Panama Jack layin' back
Tape deck, Ray Bans and good friends
Every summer, we couldn't wait to run wild
So we piled in the Jeep, hot seats, lookin' for something

2 for 1 at the Ramada, drinking coconut coladas
Chasing senoritas out by the pool
Oh, I pulled a string on her bikini thinkin' all my friends would see me
But I found out that I wasn't so cool

Oh, oh, ooh, old school

I remember dirty slow dancin', off rhythm kissin'
Beer stickin' to our shoes
And I'd whisper in her ear and she'd give me that smile for awhile
'Cause she knew it wasn't true

Man that cover band was killer
They were jammin' Steve Miller 'til it's last call at quarter to two
A Dr. Pepper chaser for another shot of Jager
And you're prayin' that she's leaving with you

Oh, oh, ooh, old school
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, old school, yeah

2 for 1 at the Ramada drinkin' coconut coladas
Chasin' senoritas out by the pool

Man that cover band was killer
They were jammin' Steve Miller 'til it's last call at quarter to two
A Dr. Pepper chaser for another shot of Jager
And you're prayin' that she's leaving with you

Oh, oh, ooh, old school
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, old school
Oh, oh, yeah, old school, old school

I remember Panama Jack layin' back
Tape deck, Ray Bans and good friends, yeah


I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting
Two names in a heart-shaped tattoo
I think cupid is stupid and violets are purple not blue
I hate catching bouquets, the honeymoon phase
And letterman jackets don't fit
Your eyes can't hold stars and you'd die if your heart really skipped


I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you


I hate pink hearts with glitter and Valentine's dinner
And roses just die in a week
We were drunk when we met so we don't know our anniversary (Whoops)
Oh, and I'm far too vain to kiss in the rain
The clouds, they aren't numbered to nine
And you make me feel something
But it sure as hell ain't butterflies


I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
Yeah


I really do


And I'll always love you but I don't have to sing it
"For worse or for better" don't rhyme
They say I got the right one so now I should write one
But I'd rather just show you tonight


'Cause I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
I hate love songs
The old and the new
I hate love songs
But I love you


Every day I clock out
And head straight to her house
We cuddle up on the couch
But it always ends the same ole way
I'm driving home and it's incredibly late
Something's got to change, because


I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day and every night she's all I think about
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around


Went to the bank took out a loan
Went and bought the perfect stone
Called up her dad on the phone
I'm talking him to dinner Sunday night
I've never been so nervous in my life
I want to do this right, because




Yes sir I love her very much
I know it's only been seven months
But that's long enough




I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around


Hammer and a nail, stacking them bales
I'm dog tired by the 5:00 hour
But I'm ready to raise some hell
And Jesse's getting ready, I'm gassing up the Chevy
I'm gonna pick her up at six
I hope she's gonna wear the jeans with the tear
That her mama never fixed


The moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
That fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah that's how we do it 'round here


Mud on the grips, wild cherry on her lips
I've been working and trying and flirting and dying
For an all night kinda kiss
Country on the boombox, candles on the tool box
I'm doing everything right, got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight

 x2
Yeah the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
That fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright, Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah that's how we do it 'round here


Yeah that's how we do it round here
Yeah that's how we do it round here


Just the way you float through a crowded room
With that long, tangled blonde hanging down
Just the way you move to the groove playing in my head
The soft of your lips, the touch of your hand
The being your man when it's time to go


Even if you'd never broke my heart
Even if you'd never broke my heart
I'd still be begging you to tear it apart
Even if you'd never broke my heart


If you were mine again by now
We'd be making out in the backseat of a city cab
We'd hit the floor just past the door cause we can't wait
Baby, we can't wait
It'd be the sun coming through
The window and you still being here




Even if you'd never broke my heart

Sit in that six-lane backed up traffic
Horns are honking, I've about had it
I'm looking for an exit sign
Gotta get out of here, get it all off my mind
And like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin' through the radio static
Changing my mood
A little George Strait 1982

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road

I've been cooped up, tied down, 'bout forgotten
What a field looks like, full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need a curve and wind-a-twistin'
Dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowing through my baby's hair

Yeah, makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road

Maybe it's the feeling or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab you honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road, get right with my soul
Now all I gotta do is take some old back road
(Some old back road) to the shady spot where things get hot
(Some old back road) way down, way down
Way down some old back road


I take off time to time
With those crazy friends of mine
Head out on steel horses
With wheels and we ride


We burn up that road to old Mexico
Blend in with the desert
Just we amigos
And we roll


Cowboys like us sure do have fun
Racing the wind, chasing the sun
Take the long way around back to square one
Today we're just outlaws out on the run
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
For cowboys like us


We talk about living, babies, and women
All that we've lost and all we've been giving
We sing about true love, lie about things we ain't done
Drink one more cold one, come morning get up
And we roll


Cowboys like us sure do have fun
Racing the wind, chasing the sun
Take the long way around back to square one
Today we're just outlaws out on the run
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
For cowboys like us
Cowboys like us sure do have fun
Racing the wind, chasing the sun
Take the long way around back to square one
Today we're just outlaws out on the run
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
For cowboys like us


Cowboys like us


Setting fires, and dark desires
The nights that I just can't recall
I've woke up flyin', with the angels
But no one to catch me, when I fall


Goin' down the wrong road, and
Livin' by the wrong code, and
Chasin' after dreams that don't come true
Lookin' for the right signs, and
Ridin' on the white lines, just
Tryin' to find my way to you


Well, there's been high times, and there's been hard times
And there's been times I couldn't tell
If I'm livin' a good life or livin' a bad life
'Cause I'm always livin' fast as hell


I'm goin' down the wrong road
Livin' by the wrong code, and
Chasin' after dreams that don't come true
Lookin' for the right signs, and
Ridin' on the white lines, just
Tryin' to find my way to you


From an Alabama porch
To a dirty bar room floor
Burnin' bridges down I'd never even crossed
From when I didn't have a care
To when I didn't have a prayer
I never once thought I was lost, somehow I knew
I would find my way to you


I'm goin' down the wrong road
Livin' by the wrong code
Chasin' after dreams that don't come true
Lookin' for the right signs
Ridin' on the white lines, just
Tryin' to find my way to you


Tryin' to find my way to you

Got your bag on your shoulder
Never thought once about thinkin' it over
Feel like you're the only one
Who's ever been in a bad situation
Now you need to take yourself a love vacation
'Cause after all, what's done is done

Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Everything around you's growin' old
The days drag on, the nights last forever
Every day's tougher just to keep it together
Forget everything you've ever known
Except for home

He made a promise he couldn't keep
I bet he's not losing a bit of sleep
Over how you're getting down the line
Now don't you fret, now don't you worry
Don't get in too much of a hurry
'Cause up ahead's that city limit sign

Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Everything around you's growin' old
The days drag on, the nights last forever
Every day's tougher just to keep it together
Forget everything you've ever known
Except for home

Home is where the heart is:
That's what somebody once said. (Yeah.)
I think your heart is where your love is:
All the rest baby, the rest it's all in your head

Well, memories, they're over-rated:
All they do is get you down an' frustrated
And who needs that on their back?
Starting over, cold turkey
Washin' your soul of everything that's dirty
Seal your heart of every crack

You're no longer sick and tired
Everything around you feels brand new
Yeah. the days fly by, the nights could be longer:
Every day you're just a little bit stronger
Now that you've spread your wings and flown
Back to home
Back to home
Back to home. (Home.)
Yeah, back to home
(Back to home.)


1, 2, 3, 4
Mmm
Yeah
(Na!)
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na
Na na, na-na-na-na


Oh, I used to sing it
And I used to crank it with the windows down
I used to love it
Oh, but I'm over it, man, I'm over it now


I used to leave it playin' on repeat
I spun the record 'til it turned on me
Yeah, the DJ knows exactly what I need
I need it out with the old, in with a new beat


You were the rooftop, at the top of my lungs
Blowin' the speakers, in the back of my trunk
And you had your chance then, yeah, but I'm movin' on
And now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song

The soundtrack, every night in my bed
You were the woo-hoo, gettin' stuck in my head
Now you're just an echo, when the feeling is gone
Baby, now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song


We had a moment
There's no more magic in the melody
It's lost and you know it
It's just the sound of what we used to be


Yeah, I used to leave it playin' on repeat
I spun the record 'til it turned on me
Yeah, the DJ knows exactly what I need
A little dancin' could be good for me


You were the rooftop, at the top of my lungs
Blowin' the speakers, in the back of my trunk
And you had your chance then, yeah, but I'm movin' on
And now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song

The soundtrack, every night in my bed
You were the woo-hoo, gettin' stuck in my head
Now you're just an echo, when the feeling is gone
Baby, now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song


Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na nah
Na, na-na-na-na
(Oh, you're yesterday's song)
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na nah
Na, na-na-na-na


I got a whole new 'hey' (hey)
I got a brand new woo (hey)
I got new moves, and you're old news
I got a new song, I wanna sing to you
I'm gonna get by, I'm gonna get through without you


You used to be the rooftop, at the top of my lungs
Blowin' the speakers, in the back of my trunk
Yeah, you had your chance then, yeah, but I'm movin' on (yeah, but I'm movin' on)
And now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song

The soundtrack, every night in my bed
You were the woo-ooh, gettin' stuck in my head (stuck in my head)
Now you're just an echo, when the feeling is gone
Baby, now you're just yesterday's song, yesterday's song
Yesterday's song, oh


Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na nah
Na, na-na-na-na
(Oh, the feeling is gone, yeah, the feeling is gone, yeah)
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na nah
Na, na-na-na-na
(Goodbye, goodbye, baby)
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na nah (yesterday's song)
Na, na-na-na-na

Every now an' then, on my home
I stop at a spot where the wild flowers grow, an' I pick a few
'Cause she don't tell me to
I go out with my boys all right
But most of the time I call it a night before they do
'Cause she don't tell me to
Sunday mornin', I'm in church
An' my butt an' my back an' necktie hurt, but I'm in the pew
She don't tell me to

Any other woman I know would have tried
To control me and it would be over
Plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude
All of that stubborness melts away
When I wake with her head on my shoulder
An' I know I've got to love her
Until my life is through
'Cause she don't tell me to

Well, I got demons and I've got pride
But when I'm wrong, I apologise like she's mine to lose
'Cause she don't tell me to
Well, I got dreams in this heart of mine
But nothin' that I wouldn't lay aside if she asked me to
'Cause she don't tell me to
An' she don't even know
That she keeps lookin' for the next right thing to do
'Cause she don't tell me to
Yeah, yeah

Any other woman I know would have tried
To control me and it would be over
Plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude
And all of that stubborness melts away
When I wake with her head on my shoulder
An' I know I've got to love her
Until my life is through
What else can I do?
What else can I do?
Whoa, I love her
'Cause she don't tell me to
She don't tell me to

Every now an' then, on my home
I stop at a spot where the wild flowers grow, an' I pick a few
Yes I do

(Richie McDonald/Anthony Smith/Ron Harbin)

He's all dressed up
Buying flowers for the first time
His pick-up's polished
Shining like a new dime
There ain't no doubt he's got a secret
Ain't no way he's gonna keep it
Listen how the whole town's talking
There all sayin'  - - - -

Jimmy's got a girlfriend
We all know where he's been
Hugging and a kissing
Oh Jimmy's got a girlfriend

He's all tore up
From her lovin' and affection
And a boy's night out
These days is just out of the question
They say he's out there and they don't get it
But that's just love and that boy's in it
Cupid's arrow's done been shot
He didn't duck now

Jimmy's got a girlfriend
We all know where he's been
Hugging and a kissing
Oh Jimmy's got a girlfriend

Lovestruck
Starry eyed
No if's or maybe's
That boy's gone girl crazy
Girl crazy, crazy

Jimmy's got a girlfriend
We all know where he's been
He's been hugging and a kissing
Oh Jimmy's got a girlfriend

They say he's out there and they don't get it
Jimmy's got a girlfriend
Hey that's love, oh sweet love
Jimmy's got a girlfriend
He's got the girl, he's got the girl
Jimmy's got a girlfriend


Mama, you taught me to do the right things
So, now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life
And I know you watched me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer to your prayers


And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me


Mama, there's no way you'll ever lose me
Giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes


And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me


And when I watch my baby grow up
I only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find the answer to my prayers
And that she'll say


He is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me


Mama, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me


I couldn't bring myself to take you home
I've got you out here all alone
And even this old drunken mind
Still right here tonight
Yellow fireflies in the field
Think I know the way I feel
Out the corner of my eye
Did you see that?


Every star up in the sky
Has got your name on it tonight
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see
The kind of spell you put on me
You gotta know just what you do
Even the stars fall for you
Even the stars fall for you


So make a wish and make it fast
I just want this thing to last
Cause heaven knows it's falling hard
And I'm not the only one


Every star up in the sky
Has got your name on it tonight
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see
The kind of spell you put on me
You gotta know just what you do
Even the stars fall for you
Even the stars fall for you


I never counted on your touch
Making me want you so much
I never dreamed that your sweet lips
Could make me feel like this
Nothing like this


Every star up in the sky
Has got your name on it tonight
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see
The kind of spell you put on me
You gotta know just what you do
Even the stars fall for you
Even the stars fall for you


Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest


It was all roses, dripping in diamonds
Sipping on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Taking his last name


She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing


Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes


It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist


She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing


Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time


She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
Standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing


Yeah, I think I’m gonna leave
I’ll just have that one drink
And we’ve all gotta be up early
Boys, we oughta shut’er down
Just take it to the house
‘Fore anybody starts getting crazy
I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door


Aw Naw
Somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron
Hang on, I just might have to stay hey
Aw Naw
Look at the time y’all
What happend to coats on
Long gone
I should be half way home but
Aw Naw


Yeah
Girl I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cutting up and shooting Bacardi
Yeah
I got my boys with me
We’re just rolling on steam
Not looking to pick up anybody
I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes


Aw Naw
Do you hear that song
Oh one that just came on
C’mon DJ what you tryin’ to do
Aw Naw
It’ll be so wrong
If we didn’t dance one
Show off, Those jeans you painted on
Aw Naw
Aw Naw


No I didn’t mean to be here this long
And I tried to leave so it ain’t my fault
No I didn’t mean to be holding you
But tell me what was I suppose to do


Aw Naw
Somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron
Hang on, We’ve been here all night long
Aw Naw
It’ll be so wrong
If we didn’t dance one more song
Show off, Those jeans you painted on
Yea Aw Naw
Those jeans you painted on
Aw Naw


The full moon
Is shining like a spotlight
I could just sit and listen to you talking all night
When you whisper
Yeah, baby, when you lean in
I get a crazy, crazy good kind of feeling


It's like an amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back, sitting by a crackling fire
Strumming them guitar strings
Like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushing of the water when the river rolls
Winding wild and free
Baby, you sound good to me
Baby, you sound so good to me
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, you sound good to me


Tell me
All of your stories
And don't you leave nothing out
'Cause baby, I ain't in a hurry
Every little thing you say
Got a real nice ring to it
The way it rolls off your lips
Oh, when you give me that kiss


It's like an amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back, sitting by a crackling fire
Strumming them guitar strings
Like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushing of the water when the river rolls
Winding wild and free
Baby, you sound good to me
Baby, you sound so good to me
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, you sound good to me


Baby, you sound good to me
Baby, you sound so good to me
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, mmmm, mmmm


Like an amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back, sitting by a crackling fire
Strumming them guitar strings
Like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushing of the water when the river rolls
Winding wild and free
Baby, you sound good to me
Baby, you sound so good to me
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, you sound good (sound so good)
Baby, you sound good to me (sound so good)
Baby, you sound so good to me (sound so good)
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, you sound good to me

I could lose my vision
My eyes no longer see
I could lose my religion
In my struggle to believe
That would be a loss
That would be a cross
I'd somehow rise above
But Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love
I've traded my innocence
For the secrets of the night
Felt my calloused conscience
Lose it's grip on wrong and right
It cut me to the bone
But somehow I've held on
'Cause I could feel your touch
But Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love
'Cause you are the one light that shines on me
Without your love God knows where I'd be
Lost without a prayer
Somewhere way out there
My soul would turn to dust
Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love
'Cause you are the one light that shines on me
Without your love God knows where I'd be
So hold me close again
Tell me it won't end
And that will be enough
Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love
Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love

I didn't know better I'd hang my hat right there
If I didn't know better I'd follow you up the stairs

Stop saying those sweet things you know I like to hear
The horns are blowing louder and they're destroying me

Why do I keep drinking
Wasting my time on you
If I didn't know better
Well, damn it
I do

There's a hole in what you're saying
I can plainly see
You have a lover that's waiting but baby you're right

Here with me

Ooh, you might as well be the devil
Oh, keeping me out past three
Oh, you're the one with that apple so baby you can't
Blame me

Why don't you keep drinking
Get me one night with you
If I didn't know better
Well, damn it
I do
You know that I do

Oh, baby you're right here with me
Oh, baby you know


Got a date a week from Friday
With the preacher's son
Everybody says he's crazy
I'll have to see
I finally moved to Jackson
When the summer came
I won't have to pay that boy to rake my leaves
I'm probably going on and on
It seems I'm doing more of that these days


I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh, you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky
To have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
Cause if I'd never seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way


Mama says that I just shouldn't speak to you
Susan says that I should just move on
You oughta see the way these people look at me
When they see me 'round here talking to this stone
Everybody thinks I've lost my mind
But I just take it day by day


I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh, you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky
To have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
Cause if I'd never seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way
Probably wouldn't be this way


Got a date a week from Friday
With the preacher's son
Everybody says I'm crazy
Guess I'll have to see


She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sitting in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barking and a wagging around
And I just laughed and said you all get in


She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do baby I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here


And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor


Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house


Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor


Just let me dust of the seat
Put your pretty little arms around me, hell yeah


You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor


Oh yeah, we can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah


She's like a picture from an airplane window
It's always sunny up above the clouds
She's got a mouth full of innuendo
But she makes it sound innocent somehow
Those hungry eyes can't eat the night
Take me to church, show me the light
Straight masterpiece, way out of my league
Yeah but I'm gonna hold her like a trophy tonight


She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on Borrowed Time
She's gonna rip off ay kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't gonna sit here and overthink it
I got a tiger by the tail
I'll just smile when she sinks her teeth in
She'll leave a scar and a story to tell


She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on Borrowed Time
She's gonna rip off ay kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away


Hey hey, hey hey
She's gonna sting me but damn it I want it
Hey hey, hey hey
Honey's so sweet in that moment


She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on Borrowed Time
She's gonna rip off ay kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
Hey hey, yeah
Hey hey, yeah
Hey hey, yeah
Hey hey, yeah, yeah


I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't


Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing


In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know


The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking


One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em


In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know


You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything


In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know

I never once, backed down from a punch
I'd take it square on the chin
Well I found out fast a bullys just that and you got to stand up to him
So I didn't cry when I got a black eye as bad as it hurt I just grinned
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Scared me to death when took your first steps
Well I'd fall everytime you fell down
Your first day of school
I cried like a fool, I followed your school bus to town
Well I didn't cry when ol Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be
Dads they turn into big babies again
Well I'm a grown man and as strong as I am
Well sometimes it's hard to believe
One little girl with little blonde curls can totally terrify me
If you were to ask my wife would just laugh
She'd say I know all about men
How tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Well I know one day I'll give you away
And I'm goin to stand there and smile
When I get home and I'm all alone
I'll sit in your room for awhile
Cause when tough little boys grow up to be
Dads they turn into big babies again

Lying here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile


I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take this slow


Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No I don't want to mess this thing up
No I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight


I know that if we give this a little time
It will only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real, no it's never felt so right


Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No I don't want to mess this thing up
No I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight


No I don't want to say goodnight
I know it's time to leave, but you'll be in my dreams
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight


Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No I don't want to mess this thing up
No I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, oh
Let's do this right, with just a kiss goodnight
With a kiss goodnight
Kiss goodnight


Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows she's gonna be late
Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, it's a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan


You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Day's gone and the night's on fire


She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh, ooohh


She's a seat laid back, a boy's dream
Drawin' hearts in the window steam
She's a gettin' you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline
When you know what you're headed to
What's a red blooded boy to do


She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh
She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire, oohh
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire, oohh


You try to play it cool but the night's on fire, oohh, oohh

I could say it's all her fault
She never had any patience at all
I'm a complicated guy, and she didn't try to understand
I could claim I had nothing to do with the fact I'm lonesome and blue
But that wouldn't be true I'm a self made man

Ya I'm the one that fooled around
And let the one who loved me down
She had more of me then she could stand
Well I blamed everyone but me
And now that it's to late I see
Nobody helped me get to where i am
I'm a self made man

I could blame it on the way I was raised
Or I could say I was just to afraid
To lay my heart in somebody elses hands
I can alwats make one more excuse
But in the end whats the use I might as well face it
I'm a self made man

Ya I'm the one who fooled around
Let the one who loved me down
Cause she had more of me than she could stand
I blamed everyone but me
But now that it's to late I see
Nobody helped me get to where I am
I'm a self made man

Whoaaaa I blamed everyone but me
But now that it's to late I see
Nobody helped me get to where I am
I'm a self made man

A self made man

A self made man

Ahhh I can't blame nobody but me


Something like a strong wind is coming over me
Has got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
Really I shouldn't be


One more call
It’s one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It’s one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again


One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer


So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don’t bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I’m all alone and picking up the phone


It's one more call
It’s one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It’s one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
It's one more here we go again


One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer


One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer


Stay a little longer
Wishing you could stay a little longer...

That's what I'm talkin' about
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

I cut my teeth on an old lawn-mower
Cleanin' out gutters, doin' other people's chores
After school. weekends an' holidays
Yeah, ever since then, all I've known
Is my nose on fire from the grindstone
A lifetime built on an hourly wage
Muscled arms an' calloused hands:
I am the workin' man

The sun comes up, the sun goes down
Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round
Blazin' hot, freezin' cold:
No matter what, it still goes on
Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin'
Somebody's gotta fix it:
I am the workin' man
Yes, I am

Now I've laid asphalt an' I've laid brick:
I've hung sheet, rock and shovelled sh**
Eat my lunch down at the Kwickie-Mart
Oh, I fill the potholes on easy-street
So show some respect when you look at me
I'm just out here tryin' to do my part
An' I sleep good when the day comes to an end
'Cause I am the workin' man

The sun comes up, the sun goes down
Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round
Blazin' hot, freezin' cold:
No matter what, it still goes on
Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin'
Somebody's gotta fix it:
I am the workin' man

I can swing a hammer, turn a wrench
Build a tower, dig a ditch
Drive a truck that shakes the earth
Somebody's gotta do the dirty work

The sun comes up, the sun goes down
Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round
Blazin' hot, freezin' cold:
No matter what, it still goes on
Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin'
Somebody's gotta fix it:
I am...
I am the workin' man

Yes I am
Oh. the workin' man


Gonna raise up a tall glass
Tonight as we look back
Back on all the life that we lived through
Yeah, the things that we drink to


Roads that we choose, friends that we make
Turns that we miss and the hearts that we break
The words that we say and the ones that we don't
Lines that we cross and the ones that we won't
Tears that we cried, the dreams that we dreamed
Stars that burnt out and the stars that we reached
The pictures we take, the stories they tell
And the moments we keep for ourselves


Gonna raise up a tall glass
Tonight as we look back
Back on all the life that we lived through
Yeah, the things that we drink to

Shed a little light on a memory
Kinda makes it feel like you're with me
I'm still a little lost here without you
Yeah, the things that we drink to


The hurt that we heal, the songs that we sing
The hope that we know tomorrow can bring
The battles we fight, the wars that we win
The pain that we been through
(Things that we drink to
Things that we drink to)


Gonna raise up a tall glass
Tonight as we look back
Back on all the life that we lived through
Yeah, the things that we drink to

We can wonder where all the time goes
But it don't change a thing though
All I'm tryna say is I miss you
Yeah, the things that we drink to

(Things that we drink to
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Things that we drink to)


All I'm tryna say is I miss you
Yeah, the things that we drink to

(Track 3 - Time 3:57)

She locked the door behind her
And headed out of town
And it don't much matter where she's bound
She left it all except a heart full of memories
And scars you never see, from

Those words he hurt her with and held her down
And the tears that fell without a sound
And she swears it's gonna be different now
This time around

He's taking it step by step and one day at a time
Trying to find the man he was and left behind
Fighting the battle sometimes barely holding on
Now that all he loved is gone, with..

Those words he hurt her with and held her down
And the tears that fell when she walked out
And she swears it's gonna be different now
This time around

He wants the chance to be
The man she used to see in him, before

He wants the chance to be
The man she used to see in him, before

All of those words he hurt her with and held her down
And the tears that fell without a sound
And she swears it all will be different now
This time around
This time around

For fear the hearts of men are failing
For these are latter days we know
The Great Depression now is spreading
God's word declared it would be so

I'm going where there's no depression
To the lovely land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble
My home's in Heaven, I'm going there

In that bright land, there'll be no hunger
No orphan children crying for bread
No weeping widows, toil or struggle
No shrouds, no coffins, and no death

I'm going where there's no depression
To the lovely land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble
My home's in Heaven, I'm going there

This dark hour of midnight nearing
And tribulation time will come
The storms will hurl in midnight fear
And sweep lost millions to their doom

I'm going where there's no depression
To the lovely land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble
My home's in Heaven, I'm going there


I work down at Ashbury Hill
Minimum wage, but it pays the bills
Cleaning floors and leading hymns on Sunday
Catherine Davis, room 3-0-3
Sweetest soul you ever could meet
I bring her morning coffee every day


She calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
'Fore your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me


She talks about the clothes
On the line in summer air
Christmas morning
And Thanksgiving prayer
And stories of a family
That I never had
Well sometimes I find myself
Wishing I'd been there




There's a small white cross in Arlington
Reads Raymond Davis, '71
Until she can see his face again
I'm going to fill in the best I can




She calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me


I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane


Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane


We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane


Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane


On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane


Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane


I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane

Water towers are made for hearts and names
Friday nights are made for football games
Fallin' leaves are made for fallin' in
Front porch steps are made for goodnight kissin'
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

Summer jobs are made for spendin' cash
Second dates are made for goin' fast
Early curfews are made for sneakin' past
2am was made for pissed off dads
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

Smoky bars are made for "how 'bout a dance?"
Open roads are made for holdin' hands and
Laid back seats are made for young love
Two pink lines are made for growin' up

Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

Tiny shoes are made for tiny feet
My two arms are made for where you sleep
Sky was made for the moon and stars
You were made to steal my heart
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you


You can buy you a brand new truck
Chrome it all out, jack it way up
You can build you a house up high on a hill
With a pool and a pond and a view to kill
You can make all the money in sight
But you ain't living the good life


Until you put a girl in it
You ain't got nothin
What's it all worth
Without a little loving
Put a girl in it
Some huggin and some kissin
If you're world's got somethin missin
Just put a girl in it


You can buy a boat and a shiny set of skis
Have some fun in the sun, float around in the breeze
You can lay out on a blanket by the lake
Drink a cold beer, polish off another day
Kick on back and watch the sky turn red
A sunset ain't a sunset




You can write you a country song
The DJ won't put it on
They won't dance or sing along




If you're ridin in your truck
Put a girl in it
If you're going to have a party
Put a girl in it
If you want to live the good life
Better put a gir-r-rl in it


Early monday morning to friday at five

All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Haaaouuhhh Yeaaa


She's a small-town, hard-working woman
Just trying to make a living
Working three jobs, feeding four little mouths
In a run-down kitchen
When you never taking nothing and doing nothing but giving
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian


She said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away"
She said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a smoke break"


He's a big-city, hard-working man just trying to climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of driving a tractor
Never had nothing handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son
Do something good that matters


He said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I wanna pop that top
Take a swig and make the world stop
And watch it fade away"
He said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I wanna light it up
Yeah, when things get tough
Sometimes I need a smoke break"


So here's to you and here's to when the day gets long
Go ahead, I understand if you wanna take a load off


I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away
Yeah, and I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a


When the day gets long
When the work's all done
When the sun sets
When you need to forget
Grab that cup, mmm
Fill it up
Sip it slow
And let it all go


Oh, I promise I didn't know he was your man
I would have noticed a gold wedding band
Diane
I'd rather you hate me than not understand
Oh, Diane


You pick the time and the place
Dont know how much this hurts
I gave him my heart to break
Now I know he broke yours first
Lyin' right there in my bed
While he was lying to you
Believing the words that he said
How could we be such fools?


And all those nights that he's given to me
I wish that I could give them back to you


Diane
I promise I didn't know he was your man
I would have noticed a gold wedding band
Diane
I'd rather you hate me than not understand
Oh, Diane


You can blame me if it helps
That's what a good wife would do
But you're only cheating yourself
Choosing him over the truth


And all those nights that he's given to me
I wish that I could give them back to you


Diane
I promise I didn't know he was your man
I would have noticed a gold wedding band
Diane
I'd rather you hate me than not understand
Oh, Diane


Oh, woah
Diane, Diane
Oh, woah
Diane
Oh, I'd rather you hate me than not understand
Oh, Diane


And all those nights that he's given to me
I wish that I could give them back to you

Alright
Yea it's been a bumpy road
Roller coasters high and low
Fill the tank and drive the car
Pedal fast, pedal hard
You won't have to go that far

You want to give up cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart

So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done you can walk instead of run
Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone

Forgot directions on your way
Don't close your eyes don't be afraid
We might be crazy late at night
I can't wait til you arrive
Follow stars you'll be alright

You want to give up cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart

So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done you can walk instead of run
Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone

You want to give up cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart

So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done you can walk instead of run
Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone

When it's all said and done you can walk instead of run
Cause no matter what you'll never be alone


Wish I could reach up and reset that sun
Reverse these wheels go back and re-pick you up
Went by so fast oh so sweet
Make me wanna remake a memory
Wish I had me a time machine
Oh


I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind


I turn back that radio dial, reopen your door
Try to talk George Strait into giving us an encore
Re-spin you around replay that sound, of you laughing when we hit the ground
I can see it now how bout we




I wanna re-fall and re-fly
Baby re-live this night




I'm wishing I could rewind
I wanna relive this night
So good, so right


Staring deep into your eyes
Searching for answers to questions I can't find
If I took for granted that I held your heart
I'd beg forgiveness but I don't know where to start


Draw me a map that leads me back to you
I don't know where to go, please tell me what to do
Help me find the road you're on
I just need directions home
Draw me a map that leads me back to you


I've never been so at loss
I'm at a can yon I can't get around or cross
So baby come down here, lay by my side
And tell me love's not lost across the great divide




You're my destiny and destination
Understand my desperation - you
The only place I wanna be
So get us back to you and me




Tearnin' down a dirt road, rebel flag flyin'
'Coon dog in the back
Truck bed loaded down with beer
And a cold one in my lap
Earnhardt sticker behind my head
And my woman by my side
Tail pipe's poppin', the radio's rockin'
"Country Boy Can Survive"
Well, if you got a problem with that
You can kiss my country ass


Well, I love turkey calls, overalls
Wrangler jeans, smoke nothin' but Marlboro Reds
Tattoos up and down my arms
And deer heads over my bed
My granddaddy fought in World War II
And my Daddy went to Vietnam
And I ain't scared to grab my gun
And fight for my homeland
If you don't love the American flag
You can kiss my country ass


If you're a downhome, backwoods redneck
C'mon, stand up and raise your glass
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass


Well, there's a whole lotta high class people out there
That's lookin' down on me
'Cause the country club where I belong
Is the honky-tonk 'til three in the mornin'
Don't wear no fancy clothes
No ties or three-piece suits
You can find me in my camouflage hat
My t-shirt and cowboy boots
If that don't fit your social class
You can kiss my country ass


If you're a downhome, backwoods redneck
C'mon, stand up and raise your glass
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass


'Cause I'm a front porch sittin'
Guitar pickin', moonshine sippin'
'Bacca juice spittin' country boy from the woods
And I love fried chicken and blue gill fishin'
And outlaw women, and I wouldn't change if I could
I ain't tryin' to start no fight but I'll finish one every time
So you just mind your own damn business
And stay the hell outta mine
If you got a problem with that
You can kiss my country ass


I said, if you got a problem with any of that
You can kiss my natural born
Redneck to the bone
Ever lovin' country ass


You need hands, rough not soft
To come and warm you up, up in that cold hayloft
Let me hold you little darling in my big strong arms
Can't get these kind of muscles anywhere but a farm


Hey, I'm a country man
A city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt cure a ham
Hey baby, I'm a country man


I've got a jeep with camouflage seats
That way nobody sees us parked back up in these trees
Your little iPod loaded down with Hoobastank
Don't be a tape player hater girl were cruising to Hank


Hey, I'm a country man
A city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt cure a ham
Hey baby, I'm a country man


You like the ivy league Humvee tennis sweater type
But girl, I'm here to tell you, don't believe the hype


Hey, I'm a country man
I can wrestle hogs and gators with my two bare hands
Girl, you better move quick I'm in high demand
Hey, baby, I'm a country man


Hey I'm a country man
Hunting me a good ol' country girlfriend
Why don't you come and join me in my new deer stand?
Hey, baby, I'm a country man
Hey, baby, I'm a country man


I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel


If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up


He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you
Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along
And he don't even know a single word


If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
I'ma be the first to call baby


Sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel


If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
Oh, if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up

He was driving home one evening
In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down;
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Till he said "I'm here to help you ma'am
By the way, my name's Joe."

She said, "I'm from St. Louis"
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you."

When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said, "How much do I owe you?"

Here's what he had to say:

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you

Well a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along
And dead on her feet

No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress's eyes
When she read what she wrote:

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you

That night when she got home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking 'bout the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low:
"Everything's gonna be alright; I love you, Joe."


Well I love her
But I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake
And hell is all I catch
Today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishin' hole today
She'd be packin' all her things
And she'd be gone by noon


Well, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lake shore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, look there, another bite


Now there's a chance that if I hurry
I could beg her to stay
But that water's right
And the weather's perfect
No tellin' what I might catch today


Well, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lake shore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, look there, another bite


Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, look there, another bite


Goin' through my closet the other day
I found an old yearbook, flipped right to the page
Of that senior trip
Down there on that Panama strip
We all started yellin' when we smelled the beach
Couldn't wait to try our fake IDs
We only had a few days
And a whole lot of memories to make


Oh, man, we were livin'
Didn't waste one minute
We talked and drank and danced and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried


This past year my family
Was sittin' cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree
Listenin' to granddad
We all knew it'd probably be his last
He was crackin' jokes and we were takin' turns
Tellin' stories 'bout fishin' or lessons learned
Out on the porch with him
We all felt like kids again


Oh, man, we were livin
Sittin' there reminiscin'
We sang and talked and traveled back in time
We laughed until we cried


It's like the best days under the sun
Every emotion rolled into one
A little of this, a little of that
Kinda happy, kinda sad


Just the other night the baby was cryin'
So I got out of bed rocked her awhile
And I held her tight
And I told her it would be all right
And my mind went back to a few years ago
When we tried so long, we almost gave up hope
And I remember you
Comin' in and tellin me the news


Oh, man, we were livin'
Goin' crazy in the kitchen
We danced and screamed and held each other tight
We laughed until we cried


She got a smile that makes your worst day
Feel like it's your birthday
She's got a laugh like confetti
Would change her name if she'd let me


She's got a way of changing the game
The way that you play, it's never the same


She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Drop your plans, drop a grand
Hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her
She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call
She make you wanna die for her


The way that she moves
Is like a soft glow, flicker of a candle
She turns my cool into disaster
Heart is pumping faster


She's head to toe, body and soul
So beautiful, she don't even know


She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Drop your plans, drop a grand
Hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her
She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call


She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah


For her, I would walk a straight line
Wear out the soles in my shoes
For her, I would run through the night
Just to kiss her one more time
If she wanted me to


She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Drop your plans, drop a grand
Hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her
She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call


She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah


We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball


Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night


Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done


Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night


Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight


Oh, We went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables
And howling at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a sole in sight
When we went out last night


Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
Baby, let's just lose control, lose control
I can handle every single curve, you know
That I love you, let me show you, oh


Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep


Real life, when it's this good don't you know
We don't need to dream at all
Baby, so...


Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep

Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be, yeah
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep
When we're losing sleep
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing


Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low


Get off work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parking lot
It was two for one and four for two
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you


I said hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over
You say, "no way" then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were wearing my


T-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my T-shirt
Yeah, my t-shirt
Oh yeah


We were walking up the stairs
With the neighbors saying "keep it down"
But it's hard to unlock the door
When you're making out
You know what I'm saying
You've been saying that we've gotta quit doin' this
So why you leanin' in for one more kiss
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
And slippin' into my


T-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
In my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
Cause you sure look good in my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
You look good on my mind


I said hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over
You say, "no way" then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were wearing my t-shirt
Mmm, you look just so dang hot in my t-shirt
I see you spinning around in my t-shirt
Right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh so hot


My t-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my,my t-shirt
In my t-shirt, yeah
You look so good in my t-shirt
My t-shirt
Oh you look so good in my t-shirt

The lights around the Christmas tree don't burn as bright
And all around the world it isn't a silent night
Outside I hear the voices sing the sweetest sounds of caroling
But somehow there's a sadness in the song
In our hearts we know that something's wrong

Chorus:
It's a different kind of Christmas
In a different kind of world
Even though it looks the same

Everything has changed
It's a different kind of Christmas

Children opening gifts with wonder and surprise
I wish that I could still see through such innocent eyes
I used to feel so safe inside I had a place to run and hide
In my daddy's arms I felt secure
No one can protect us anymore

Chorus:
It's a different kind of Christmas
In a different kind of world
Even though it looks the same

Everything has changed
It's a different kind of Christmas

Sending cards that talk of peace and love and cheer
Oh that's what we need if we'd only believe
It would be!

Chorus:
It's a different kind of Christmas
In a different kind of world
Even though it looks the same

Everything has changed

Hey baby, what'd you know about how it feels
Honey, what'd you know about if that's real
Baby, what'd you know about the whole deal
And what'd you know about love

Hey baby, what'd you know about all its dreams
Honey, what'd you know about Cupid's schemes
Baby, what'd you know about what that means
And what'd you know about love

I've been longing to find
Another heart that would know
And it seems like yours just might

Hey baby, what'd you know about its first blush
Honey, what'd you know about the caught up rush
Baby, what'd you know about what to trust
And what'd you know about love

My heart's so often been wrong
That it still can't be sure if this
Finally did come along

Hey baby, what'd you know about all its dreams
Honey, what'd you know about Cupid's schemes
Baby, what'd you know about what that means
And what'd you know about love

Hey baby, what'd you know about how it feels
Honey, what'd you know about if that's real
Baby, what'd you know about the whole deal
And what'd you know about love

Baby, tell me what'd you know about the whole deal
And what'd you know about love

My father had skin like leather
Hands like steel
From a lifetime spent in the cottonfields
Though hed come home tired and dirty
Almost everynight
He found the strength to smile at me and hold my mama tight
While that old transister radio would play the opry out in the hall
Id sit and watch their shadows glide across the wall

And theyd dance to a dixie lullaby
Picture of love beneath the southern sky
Oh my what a beautiful life
Just like a dixie lullaby

I left home at 18
In a hand me down chevrolet
Packed my mamas goodness and my old mans stubborn ways
It was college, work, and love
Then the babies came
The youngest ones got his grandaddy's name
And in the early morning hours when my children could not sleep
I'd rock them in my arms to a simple beat

And id sing them a dixie lullaby
Hush baby dont you start to cry
Oh my what a beautiful life
Just like a dixie lullaby

My father was a mountain of a man
That was the description that i gave
The morning that we laid him in his grave
There with my mama by his side, we said our last goodbye
To a man we thought would never die
As i stood there in the fields of amazing grace
Oh how the tears ran down my face

And i sang him a dixie lullaby
Well meet again, by and by
Oh my what a beautiful life
Just like a dixie lullaby

Oh my what a beautiful life
Just like a dixie lullaby


Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
I've cut down crying to every other weekend
Thanks for asking how I've been
I've gotten too good at hiding it
With an "I'm okay", "things are great"
But the truth is
Yeah, the truth is


I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine


Daddy signed the papers the day I turned 19
And Mama drove north to find a new beginning
I blamed God, I blamed myself
Then I found my knees and prayed like hell
It's funny how a touch of grace gives you healing
Yeah, I'm healing


I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine, oh-oh, oh-oh


All these old pains
And I wish they'd go away
Gonna, guess you can't be free like a butterfly


I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
Oh, for the first time, in a long, long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
But I'm doin' fine
Yeah, yeah

He was standing there
Next to that preacher man
Shaking as he slipped that diamond on her hand
They cut the cake
Had a whirlwind honeymoon
Now on the mantle is a picture of the bride and groom

I can't believe its me
I can't believe its me
The one that gets to love you for eternity
I am so blessed that i confess this is so much more than i ever dreamed
I can't believe its me

We were lying there
We were scared to death
You were pushing as i tried to help you catch your breathe
Through all that pain
Our miracle of joy
I cried like a baby when they handed me our boy

I can't believe its me
I can't believe its me
The one that gets to love you for eternity
I look into his eyes and its us that i see
I am so blessed that i confess this is so much more than i ever dreamed
I can't believe its me

Of all the people in this world
There's just one lucky soul holding you girl

I can't believe its me
I can't believe its me
The one that gets to love you for eternity
I am so blessed that i confess this is so much more than i ever dreamed
I can't believe its me

I can't believe its me
I can't believe
I can't believe its me


Baby, look here at me
Have you ever seen me this way
I've been fumbling for words
Through the tears and the hurt and the
Pain
I'm gonna lay it all out
On the line tonight
And I think that it's time
To tell this uphill fight goodbye


Have you ever had to love someone
That just don't feel the same
Trying to make somebody care for you
The way I do
Is like trying to catch the rain
And if love is really forever
I'm a winner at a losing game


I know that baby, you tried
To find me somewhere inside of you
But you know you can't lie
Girl, you can't hide the truth
Sometimes two hearts
Just can't dance to the same beat
So I'll pack up my things
And I'll take what remains of me




I know that I'll never be the man that you need or love
Yeah, baby it's killing me to stand here and see
I'm not what you've been dreaming of




Oh, oh, if love is really forever
I'm a winner at a losing game
Oh, I'm tired of losing
Oh, oh, oh-

She hates bein' on her own, but she does her best
Empty nights create the hunger for love and tenderness
She spends so much time alone
She says it makes her wonder
If she'll ever find someone who'll make her feel alive
And satisfy the hunger

He always reads a lot at night, but he's gettin' tired of it
An empty house deepens desire for true companionship
When he sees himself in the mirror, he don't look no younger
He just keeps on fightin' the fear that'll he'll go through life
And not satisfy the hunger

Oh the hunger, the need for lovin' arms
Oh the hunger, longing for contentment of the heart

She picks up a second job at an all night diner
Anything that she can do to fill the empty hours
Then by chance her destiny he's there across the counter
Their lives are changed by what they see in each other's eyes
They recognize the hunger

Oh the hunger, the need for lovin' arms
Oh the hunger, longing for contentment of the heart

The hunger
Oh, the hunger
Yeah, the hunger

Wish I didn't feel so helpless
Wish I didn't act so selfish
Wish I didn't wring my hands night and day
My hair was a little bit smoother
My jeans fit a little bit looser
And I always knew the right things to say

And I wish I wouldn't hide what's been going inside
And I wish you wouldn't get scared and run away

Wish I was doin' better with all the things that matter
I guess I got some learnin' to do
Wish everyone had someone who'll hold'em and who'll love'em
The way I'm always gonna love you
I wish wishes came true

I wish there was a cure for cancer
Wish somebody had an answer
And all God's children never got hurt
I wish Eve never broke that apple
Young men never went to battle
And I didn't get so mad at the world

I wish I was more like Jesus and could pickup all the pieces
And make a better life for my baby girl

Oh
Wish I was doin' better with all the things that matter
I guess I got some learnin' to do
Wish everyone had someone who'll hold'em and who'll love'em
The way I'm always gonna love you
I wish wishes came true
Wishes came true

For everything I'm wishin' I know someone's up there listenin'
So I'll say my prayers when I go to bed

Haaaaaa haaaaaaa haaaaaa
Oh I'll pray my wishes come true
Haaaaaa haaaaaaa haaaaaa
Ohhhhhh
Wish I was doin' better with all the things that matter
Guess I got some learnin' to do
Oh wish everyone had someone who'll hold'em and who'll love'em
The way I'm always gonna love you
I wish wishes came true
Wishes came true

I know wishes come true
I wish (I wish)
I wish (I wish)

Hello mom and dad, what's been goin' on
I know it's been awhile, since I've written home
I like my new job, sure I like this town
But I finally got me something to write home about

She's got long blonde hair, and deep blue eyes
She likes the music loud and walkin' in the moon light
She laughs sometimes, sometimes until she cries
Oh mom, I'm in love, and dad, I'm sure you'd be proud
'Cause I finally got me something to write home about

I got that raise in pay now ain't just getting by
Looks like I'm on my way I guess I must be livin' right
Oh if my old friends could only see me now
'Cause I finally got me something to write home about

She's got long blonde hair and deep blue eyes
She likes the music loud and walkin' in the moonlight
She laughs sometimes, sometimes until she cries
Oh mom, I'm in love, and dad, I'm sure you'd be proud
'Cause I finally got me something to write home about

Yeah mom I'm in love, and dad im sure you'd be proud
'Cause I finally got me something to write home about

That girl is somethin'

Yeah she's somethin'


I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you


Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
(Yes He did)


I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true


Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
(Yes He did)


Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you


That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here

Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out

Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around

Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out


I saw your picture in a paper
Honeymoon in Jamaica, she's a lucky girl
You look so grown up in your black tux, from a ballcap in a pick up Seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young


I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, and she got the man


Yeah there's an old you that I knew
Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars
Backwoods on a four wheel, hanging on tight
I can still feel my racing heart
And now you're cleaned up with a hair cut, nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose?


I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding ban
I got the boy, and she got the man

I got the first kiss and she’ll get the last
We each got something, the other will never have
I got the long hair, hot head
She got the cool and steady hand
I got the boy and she got the man
I got the boy and she got the man


Thought it was safe to go outside
But I guess I was wrong
Thought I could take a little ride
Just to see what was going on
Girl I know it's been a while
A while since you've been gone I swear
Oh, but baby I still see you everywhere


Around every corner, cafe, back road, stop sign
Stoplight, streetlight glowing
Around every highway, driveway, fast song, slow song
On my radio
At every party, dive bar, backseat in my car
Sounds crazy I know
But you just keep hanging around
You got me living in a ghost town
Girl I see you every road I go down
Your memory of me about to throw down, showdown, oh now
Why'd you leave me living in a ghost town?


Across the room I see your face
Then it disappears
I hear your voice call out my name
Whispering in my ear
I reach for you but you're not here
You're still here


Around every corner, cafe, back road, stop sign
Stoplight, streetlight glowing
Around every highway, driveway, fast song, slow song
On my radio
At every party, dive bar, backseat in my car
Sounds crazy I know
But you just keep hanging around
You got me living in a ghost town
Girl I see you every road I go down
Your memory of me about to throw down, showdown, oh now
Why'd you leave me living in a ghost town?


Well, I know you don't want me
So why, oh why, oh why do you haunt me?


Around every corner, cafe, back road, stop sign
Stoplight, streetlight glowing
Around every highway, driveway, fast song, slow song
On my radio
At every party, dive bar, backseat in my car
Sounds crazy I know
But you just keep hanging around
You got me living in a ghost town
Girl I see you every road I go down
Your memory of me about to throw down, showdown, oh now
Why'd you leave me living in a ghost town?


There's a place I've been looking for
That took me in and out of buildings
Behind windows, walls and doors
And I thought I found it
Couple times, even settled down
And I'd hang around just long enough
To find my way back out
I know now the place that I was trying to
Reach
Was you, right here in front of me


And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breaking
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me heeere, right here (oh.. baby)


It's amazing what I let my heart go through
To get me where it got me
In this moment here with you
And it passed me by
God knows how many times
I was so caught up in holding
What I never thought I'd find
I know now, there's a million roads
I had to take
To get me in your arms this way


And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breaking
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me heeeere


In a love I never thought I'd get to get to
-here
And if that's the road
God made me take to be with you


And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breaking
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me heeere, right here (right here)
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)


And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me heeere, right here
Oh, baby....Ooohhh
Oh, got me here

I will answer the wind
I will leave with the tide
I'll be out on the road
Every chance I can ride

No matter how far
No matter how free
I'll be alone
If you'll wait for me

There'll be times when I'll rise
There'll be times when I'll fall
There'll be times when its best to say nothing at all

Knowing you're right
Letting it be
I'll be around
If you'll wait for me
If you'll wait for me

And I'll fight for the right to go over the hill
If it'll only mean something to me
I will not be persuaded
I won't be still
I'll find a way to be free

In the cool of the night
In the heat of the day
If you're ever in doubt
I'll be on my way
Straight to your side
I guarantee
I'll be around
If you'll wait for me
If you'll wait for me*


What you got if you ain't got love
The kind that you just wanna give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith


'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
When you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small


It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking 'bout what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by
Moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back


Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Oh, it sure makes everything else
Seem so small


Yeah, yeah

Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey


Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach
Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat
Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet
I can't help but stare cause I got the best seat
Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in
Said, "I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees"


You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, Coppertone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey


I was slow driving south with the top drop down
Her hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud
You gave me that look, you licked them lips
I said, "Hang on baby, better pull over for this"
I don't wanna get DWK, driving while kissing they'll put you away


You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
It's like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, Coppertone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

Sirens wail and a flashin' light
Nothing better to do on a Tuesday night
But give me hell
Where you headed, what are you out for?
We don't see much of you 'round here anymore
I guess it's just as well
Well once upon a time you had it all
You let everybody down
You're always seventeen in your hometown

Running from your folks, running from the law
Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all
You keep on running boy
You run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen in your hometown

Her porch swing still looks the same
She probably won't even remember my name
Just like she didn't back then
Is she married, is she doing fine
Does she know about all the nights I lay awake crying
Just to know her hand?
The door opens and I run away, just like the same 'ole clown
You're always seventeen in your hometown

Running from your folks, running from the law
Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all
You keep on running boy
You run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen in your hometown

Well nobody is gonna miss me
No tears will fall, no one's gonna weep
When I hit that road
My boots are broken, my brain is sore
From keeping up with their little world
I got a heavy load
Gonna leave 'em on just like before, I'm big city bound
You're always seventeen in your hometown

Running from your folks, running from the law
Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all
You keep on running boy
You run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen
Yeah, you're always seventeen
You're always seventeen in your hometown


I like fast cars and sharp dreams
Chased a lot of crazy things
Left behind my share of broken pieces
This morning I turned 36
When you just remember half of it
You wonder how you outlived Hank and Jesus


I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder
But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
In a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
Fear, I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young


In the mirror I saw my surprise
Who knew gray hairs liked to hide on a head
That didn't think he'd live past thirty
If I make it thirty more
It's the brown that you'll be looking for
As you run your fingers through it and say
"Slow down, honey."


I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder
But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
In a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
Fear, I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young


Call it intuition, or call it crazy
Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies
But I'll gladly stick around if we're together
So baby, when you bow your head tonight
Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind?
And with you I'd like to live forever


So I guess it's over baby
Déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinning
I guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one
That's in the shoes that I am


Do you hear that?
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that?
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn


I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwing it away
I know you could probably tell me
Right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck
If others don't sing sad songs


Do you hear that?
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that?
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn


A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
That's right
Another lover crash and burn


Do you hear that?
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that?
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

So hard to know the reason
It's hard to know the truth
When it's all over
And everytime I look back
I just get more confused
So I replay every kiss and every clue
I might've missed

Didn't I make you happy
Didn't I get inside your heart
Didn't I make you love me
Didn't I, didn't I now baby?
I turned my world upside down
I turned myself inside out
But I still lost you
Didn't I, didn't I

Why do I keep believing
What am I hoping for
Why can't I let you go
I did all I could do
Why do I think there's something more
I just don't understand
How love slipped right through our hands

Didn't I make you happy
Didn't I get inside your heart
Didn't I make you love me
Didn't I, didn't I now baby?
I turned my world upside down
I turned myself inside out
But I still lost you
Didn't I, didn't I

Why do I think the fault is mine?
Was it me at the wrong time?
Maybe I could move on
If I knew the reason why

I turned my world upside down
I turned myself inside out
And I still lost you
Didn't I, didn't I


Every night it's the same
I hear you calling my name
You're lying next to me
I give into your charms
You disappear in my arms
I realize it's just a dream, but


Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love


And now I
Shake the sleep from my head
And try to crawl out of bed
Today is just another day
I make the coffee for one
I turn the radio on
Pretend that everything's ok, but




And now I
Know there's no reason to smile
It's gonna take me awhile
'Cause I still love you desperately




And now I
Watch the sun going down
There ain't nobody around
I feel a night in the breeze
I keep on telling myself
I don't need nobody else
And I can do as I please, but

And now I




And now
Every night it's the same
I hear you calling my name
I still love you desperately
I still love you
I still want you
I still love you desperately

I was born feet first already in a rush
I couldn`t sit still for my first haircut
By the age of twelve I was planing my big escape
I ain't never been afraid of plowin` new ground
Nothin` nobody`s gonna slow me down
Life`s never gonna happen if I let it all slip away
I`m gonna run barefoot through it
Jumpin` over trouble like there ain't nothin` to it
Makin` my way even when it`s all uphill
Oh, your never gonnna catch me standin` still
Spent most of my time on the moon
Sure broke my stride runnin` into you
You blew right thourgh my heart like a hurricane
I fell in love with you baby and I never looked back
Your the only one to stop me dead in my tracks
The chase was on when you said to me that day
I`m gonna run barefoot through it
Jumpin` over trouble like there ain't nothin` to it
Makin` my way even when it`s all uphill
Oh, your never gonnna catch me standin` still
(gotta run)
Never gonna stop me
(gotta run)
Baby you caught me
I`m gonna run barefoot through it
Jumpin` over trouble like there ain't nothin` to it
Makin` my way even when it`s all uphill
Oh, your never gonnna catch me
You ain't never gonnna catch me
Still never gonna catch me standin` still
(Standin` Still)
You ain't never gonna catch me
(Standin` Still)
I`m Standin` Still
(Standin` Still)
You ain't never gonna catch me
(Standin` Still)
Standin` Still


I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just as wild as we were green, in the ways of the world
She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning' stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last


In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop


Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl was a mother to be for 2 weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel

We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night


On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me


We took one more trip around the sun
It was all make believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins

And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time; drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene


I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me

I've been down and I've been out
I washed up when I thought I would drown
I've been down and I've been out
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground

I've been walking in circles, all my life
Chasing my own tail
I've got a penny in my pocket but the rest of my change
Is down at the bottom of the well
I've got my mind made up but what I can't figure out
Is how am I gonna leave my mark
When all I've got left is doubt

I've been down and I've been out
I washed up when I thought I would drown
I've been down and I've been out
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground

I've wasted my time all these years
Just looking for a little bit more
But it's hard to keep your shoes clean
When all you've got is dirt on the floor
And I've hit rock bottom with some good friends of mine
We sat and watched the sun rise but we never saw it shine

There's a man on the radio says he's got it all worked out
He's got a show on the road but he don't know
What it's all about

I've been down and I've been out
I washed up when I thought I would drown
I've been down and I've been out
Never flown so high with both feet on the ground


People always say
I have a laugh
Like my mother does
Guess that makes sense
She taught me how to smile
When things get rough
I've got her spirit
She's always got my back
When I look at her
I think
I want to be just like that


When I love
I give it all I've got
Like my mother does
When I'm scared
I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I feel weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because I see myself like my mother does


I never met a stranger
I can talk to anyone
Like my mother does
I let my temper fly
And she can walk away
When she's had enough
She sees everybody
For who they really are
I'm so thankful for her guidance
She helped me get this far




She's a rock
She is grace
She's an angel
She's my heart and soul
She does it all


When I love
I give it all I've got
Like my mother does
When I'm scared
I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I'm weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because
I see myself like my mother does
Like my mother does
I hear people saying
I'm starting to look like my mother does


He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man


He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man


My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man


Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man




My old man
I know one day we'll meet again
As he's looking down
My old man
I hope he's proud of who I am
I'm trying to fill the boot of my old man


My old man


You got to leave me now, you got to go alone
You got to chase a dream, one that's all your own
Before it slips away

When you're flyin' high, take my heart along
I'll be the harmony to every lonely song
That you learn to play


When you're soarin' through the air
I'll be your solid ground
Take every chance you dare
I'll still be there
When you come back down
When you come back down


I'll keep lookin' up, awaitin' your return
My greatest fear will be that you will crash and burn
And I won't feel your fire

I'll be the other hand that always holds the line
Connectin' in between your sweet heart and mine
I'm strung out on that wire


And I'll be on the other end
To hear you when you call
Angel, you were born to fly
And if you get too high
I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall


Your memory's the sunshine every new day brings
I know the sky is calling
Angel, let me help you with your wings


When you're soarin' through the air
I'll be your solid ground
Take every chance you dare
I'll still be there
For when you come back down


Take every chance you dare
I'll still be there
When you come back down
When you come back down

A bright sunrise will contradict the heavy fault that weighs you down
In spite of all the funeral songs
The birds will make their joyful sounds
You wonder why the earth still moves
You wonder how youll carry on
But youll be okay on that first day when Im gone
Dusk will come with fireflies and whippoorwill and crickets call
And every star will take its place
And silvery gown and purple shawl
Youll lie down in our big bed
Dread the dark and dread the dawn
But youll be alright on that first night when Im gone
You will reach for me in vain
Youll be whispering my name
As if sorrow were your friend
And this world so in the end
But life will call with daffodil
And morning glorious blue skies
Youll think of me some memory
And softly smile to your surprise
And even though you love me still
You will know where you belong
Just give it time well both be fine
When Im gone


You could have bowed out gracefully
But you didn't
You knew enough to know
To leave well enough alone
But you wouldn't
I drive myself crazy
Trying to stay out of my own way
The messes that I make
But my secrets are so safe
The only one who gets me
Yeah, you get me
It's amazing to me


How every day
Every day, every day
You save my life


I come around all broken down and
Crowded out
And you're comfort
Sometimes the place I go
Is so deep and dark and desperate
I don't know, I don't know


How every day
Every day, every day
You save my life


Sometimes I swear, I don't know if
I'm coming or going
But you always say something
Without even knowing
That I'm hanging on to your words
With all of my might and it's alright
Yeah, I'm alright for one more night-
Every day
Every day, every day, every day
Every day, every day
You save me, you save me, oh, oh, oh
Every day
Every, every, every day-

Every day you save my life


He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
The diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holdin' on


He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, "Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"


That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays, "Please let my crops and children grow"
'Cause that's all he is ever known


He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, "Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"




And he takes the tractor another round. (Another round)
Another round (Another round), another round
And he takes the tractor another round, another round
He says, "I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please do not let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"
"Underneath this Amarillo Sky"


The sun is shining everyday
The clouds never get in the way for you and me
I've known you just a week or two
But baby I'm so into you
Can hardly breathe


And I'm in so totally wrapped up
Emotionally attracted
So physically acting
So recklessly I need you
So desperately sure as the sky is blue
Baby I love you
I love you


I never knew that I could feel like this
Can hardly wait till our next kiss
You're so cool
If I'm dreaming please don't wake me up
Because baby I can't get enough
Of what you do


And I'm in so electrically charged up
Kinetically acting
Erratically need you
Fanatically you get to me
Magically sure as the sky is blue
Baby I love you
(I love you)


I can't believe that this is real
The way I feel
Baby I'm gone head over heels






Do you love me too
Baby I love you


There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Matches I can strike
To set afire the memory of you
Up goes down
Right's gone left me behind
Wheels spin 'round
Reverse stuck in my mind


There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Bottles I could break
To make 'em feel as broken as I do


Stack up every barrel
Since the day it was made
Satisfaction guaranteed to kill the pain
But there ain't enough
Kisses from a stranger
On a long wild night to ever make it alright
If it ain't you
In my arms, in my bed
Yeah to hell with all the rest
Once you've had the best, nothing else will do
What's the use


There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Bottles I could drink
To make 'em feel as empty as I do


With my mouth wide open
In a whiskey rain
I could stand there 24 hours a day


But there ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Bottles I could drink
To make 'em feel as empty as I do
No there ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
So forget you


I got my old guitar and some fishing poles
So baby fill that cooler full of something cold
Don't ask just pack and we'll hit the road running
Honey what do you say
I got just enough money and just enough gas
So pick a place on the map we can get to fast
Where the white sandy beach meets water like glass
And if the tide carries us away


Baby we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinking low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby lets roll with it


We get so caught up in catching up
Trying to pay the rent trying to make a buck
That don't leave much time for time for us
And ain't life too short for that
So open up that bag of pig skins you bought
At the Exxon station the last time we stopped
And you kick back baby and dance in your socks
On the windshield to some radio rock




And it won't be no thing if it starts to rain
And we have to wait it out in the truck
We might wind up a little deeper in love
So baby lets roll with it


When my little girl gets that sleep in her eyes
And she settles in with her head on my chest
Why do I feel like my heart's gonna burst
That I'm willing to die for this angel at rest


And why am I filled with unshakable faith
When I look at that child so fragile and sweet
There's something eternal I see in her face
Something much more than her mother and me


Maybe I'm looking at the face of God
Makes me think I may be looking at the face of God
And He's smiling back at me


Why do I feel like the smallest of things
When I try to count all the stars in the sky
When I see the world that we're in at it's worst
Why do I feel like it'll all be all right


I can't see the wind as it moves through the trees
So how do I know that I know that I know
That somebody out there is speaking to me
Saying: I love you and you're not alone




Oh, I know that I know that I know that He's out there
Somebody's out there
When I look at the beauty around me
And the love that surrounds me




Maybe I'm looking at the face of God
And He's smiling back at me


Kiss me like you'll never see my face again
As soft and tender as you can
Hold me like we'll never make sweet love again
Please make me feel like a man


So let's send up a prayer
For this love that we share
'Cause it could change in the blink of an eye
You just never know
How tomorrow will go
So let's make sure we kiss goodbye
Let's make sure we kiss goodbye


Look at me just like the day we fell in love
And found the missing pieces to our souls
You and me have always fit just like a glove
Wherever you are feels like home



What are you talking about
I don't really want to do this on the phone
Whatever you are gonna say, you should've said it by now
Oh, why don't you call a cab and just go home

'Cause I've heard it all before
I just don't want to hear anymore
It's two forty-four

And you only say "I'm sorry" on the rocks
You've been drinking all night
And now, you want to talk
Well, you know your shaken or stirred love
Is making it worse 'cause
"I'm sorry" on the rocks just ain't good enough

Well, I'm too tired, and you're too drunk
To keep on digging up the past
And a thousand pretty words ain't gonna mean that much
Coming from the bottom of a glass

Well, you're talking way too loud
There's too much noise in the background
I think we're breaking up now

And you only say "I'm sorry" on the rocks
You've been drinking all night
And now, you want to talk
Well, you know your shaken or stirred love
Is making it worse 'cause
"I'm sorry" on the rocks, baby, just ain't good enough

Well, I've finally had enough
And it's clear you've had way too much
This is me hanging up

Well, you only say "I'm sorry" on the rocks
You've been drinking all night
And now, you want to talk
Well, you know your shaken or stirred love
Is making it worse 'cause
"I'm sorry" on the rocks, baby, just ain't good enough

It just ain't good enough, yeah
It just ain't good enough

Everybody needs one night
To go out in style
Try on a little spotlight
For a little while

I'm talking fancy
Where the food ain't fast
Two forks, two knives
Bud Light in a glass

Rent us a car, show up late
Valet, that's right
Credit on my cards
Money in the bank
At least for tonight

Keepin' my shades on inside, all dressed in black
Escalade me, Luccheses
Yeah baby, Cadil up this lac
We ain't on the list, but we on the list

Hey, hey

Going at the DJ

Head on the dance floor
All the girls be like
"Heard he taught Timberlake"
Cause I'm smooth when I move
I'm outta my league but confident

I've had life but not like this
A good ole' boy could get used to

My shades on inside, all dressed in black
Escalade me, Luccheses
Yeah baby, Cadil up this lac
We ain't on the list, but we on the list
When you look like this, and you walk like that
Skip the line baby, don’t look back

Tonight we high class


I loved you since the very first day
When I caught you looking my way
I smiled and just knew it
And up until you came along
And no one ever heard my song
Now it's climbing with a bullet

It's nice to have someone so honestly devoted
But when it's said and done girl I hope you know that


The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you


Oh Without you yea yea


Along comes a baby girl
And suddenly my little world
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did
And people that I barely knew
They love me because I'm part of you
Man it's tough to figure

How two souls could be miles from one another
But still you and me somehow found each other


The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you


Oh Without you yea yea


Without you I'd survive
But I'd have to have the notion
That I could live this life
Just going through the motions


The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you


Without you
Without you baby baby baby without you
Without you

Every Saturday night
I watched Roy Rogers on TV
Back when everything was black and white
And easy to see
But now everything has changed
Except my memory
Of my daddy's voice when I'd fall
And skin my knee

Tell me where does it hurt
Where is the pain
You know if I could I'd make it go away
It's not the end of the world
Not heaven on earth
Did I make it better
Where does it hurt

It's thirty years later
And my little girl she's not quiet grown
In tears she calls me up one night
Says I'm gonna have a child of my own
And the boy that I love
Daddy he's gone away
And of the million things that ran
Through my mind
Only one I can say

Tell me where does it hurt
Where is the pain
You know if I could I'd make it go away
It's not the end of the world
Not heaven on earth
Can I make it better
Where does it hurt

My head's turnin' gray
And I walk really slow
And it's harder to see, and get by on my own
And I wonder if anything I've said has
Ever meant anything
And my daugther says those healing
Words to me

Tell me where does it hurt
Where is the pain
You know if I could I'd make it go away
It's not the end of the world
Not heaven on earth
Can I make it better
Oh, where does it hurt

It's not the end of the world
Can I make it better
Where does it hurt

Day One
I stumbled through hello on 5th Avenue
Day Two
We grabbed a bite to eat and talked all afternoon
Caught a movie on Day Fourteen
And Day Sixty-Seven she said "I love you" to me

Chorus:
Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay

What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

Day One Sixteen
I asked her what she was doing for the rest of my life
Day One Eighty Nine
Oh, I almost lost that girl to my foolish pride
But she said "I do" on day Four Eighty Two
And gave me a son on day Seven Sixty One

Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay

What a beautiful day

Day Eighteen Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Three
Well, Honey that's fifty years
Yeah, here's to you and me

Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay

What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

Day One, I thank God I said "Hello" on 5th Avenue

A mother riding on a city bus
Her kids yelling kicking up a fuss
Everbodys staring not knowing what shes going through
Somebody said dont you even care
Or do u let them do that everywhere
The woman turned around looked up and said
She said please forgive them they've been up all night
Their father struggled and he finally lost his fight
He went to heaven in the middle of the night
So please forgive my children
They dont understand

Everybodys busy with their own situation
Everybodys lost in their own little world
Bottled up hurried up trying to make a dream come true
They dont understand
Everybodys living like there ain't no tommorow
Maybe we should stop and take a little time
Because you never really know what your neighbors going through
Try to understand

A man driving down the interstate
Slowing down traffic making everybody wait
Everybodys staring not knowing what he's going through
Somebody said man I don't have the time
I'm running late now im stuck in line
Old man turned around and caught his eye
He said please forgive me it's been a long hard life
My wifes in a nursing home and my kids don't have the time
I've been left all alone and its getting hard to drive
So please forgive me children i hope you understand

Everybodys busy with their own situation
Everybodys lost in their own little world
Bottled up hurried up trying to make a dream come true
They dont understand
Everybodys living like there ain't no tommorow
Maybe we should stop and take a little time
Because ya never really know what your neighbors going through
Try to understand

A man hanging on a wooden cross giving everything to save the lost
Everyboyds staring not knowing what hes going through
Somebody said you don't have a care
If your a king come on down from there
He lifted up his head they heard him say
Please forgive them they have not seen the light
They'll come to know me when i come back tonight
I'll go to heaven to make everything alright
So please forgive your children
They dont understand

Everybodys busy with their own situation
Everybodys lost in their own little world
Bottled up hurried up trying to make a dream come true
They dont understand
Everybodys living like there ain't no tommorow
Maybe we should stop and take a little time
Because you never really know what your neighbors going through
Try to understand


It's a tractor firin' up
Kids playin' in a field
Four wheels gettin' stuck
A line singin' out a fishin' reel
It's a cooler slidin' in the bed of a truck
A tin roof drippin' rain
Your baby sayin', come pick me up
Take me down to the riverbank


These are sounds going down in a nowhere town
Underneath the wide open sky
It's the dust in the air and the freedom everywhere
Can't you hear it coming alive?
Makes you wanna drop it down a gear
And kill a couple of beers
Been waiting all year, now it's finally here
Back around, these are the sounds of summer


It's the flick of a lighter lighting up a little smoke
Boots climbing barbwire, a little spot nobody goes
Lawn chairs breaking out in the yard to the firework boom
Hearing a heart beating in the dark, saying that she wants to


These are sounds going down in a nowhere town
Underneath the wide open sky
It's the dust in the air and the freedom everywhere
Can't you hear it coming alive?
Makes you wanna drop it down a gear
And kill a couple of beers
Been waiting all year, now it's finally here
Back around, these are the sounds of summer
Yeah the sounds of summer


Round here that's what it's all about
So listen up and look around
It's who we are, it's what we love
So tonight let's crank 'em up


These sounds going down in a nowhere town
Underneath the wide open sky
It's the dust in the air and the freedom everywhere
Can't you hear it coming alive?
It goes way too fast, it all disappears
And when it's gone, we'll still be here
Hanging 'round, missing the sounds of summer
Missing the sounds of summer
Missing the sounds of summer
The sounds of summer
Yeah, the sounds of summer

It was just another story printed on the second page, underneath the Tiger's football score
It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age
They found him face down on his bedroom floor
There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home, then out on Mooresville Highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone

How do you get that lonely?
How do you hurt that bad to make you make the call that having no life at all is better than the life that you had?
How do you feel so empty you want to let it all go?
How do you get that lonely and nobody know?

Did his girlfriend break up with him?
Did he buy or steal that gun?
Did his mom and daddy forget to say "I love you, son?"
Did no one see the writing on the wall?
I'm not blamin' anybody; we all do the best we can
I know hindsight's 20/20, but I still don't understand
How do you get that lonely?
How do you hurt that bad to make you make the call that having no life at all was better than the life that you had?
How do you feel so empty you want to let it all go?
How do you get that lonely and nobody know?
It was just another story printed on the second page underneath the Tiger's football score


Daddy sits on a front porch swinging
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will
My Brothers found work in Indiana
M' Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me I’ve been a long time gone


Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again


Deliah plays that ol' church pian'a
Sitting out on her daddy’s farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone


Been a long time gone
Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again


Now me, I went to Nashville
Tryin' to beat the big deal
Playin' down on Broadway
Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I’m gonna be a star


Now, me and Deliah singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin’
But the music ain't got no soul
Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They've got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think


The rest is a long time gone
No, I ain't hit the roof since I don’t know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back
I said a long time gone
No, I ain't honked the horn since I don’t know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again
I said a long time, long time, long time gone
Well it’s been a long time
Long time, long time, long time gone
Oh, it's been a long time gone
Long time, long time, long time gone
Yeah yeah

My brother got out of rehab
Right around Christmas time
Mama made a turkey
Daddy was worried he was gonna have to break up a fight

Everybody was walking on eggshells
Drinking eggnog instead of beer
We were holdin' our tongues, scratchin' our heads
Wonderin' how the hell we got here

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush

We were sitting around the dinner table
And we were eating our pumpkin pie
While the sugar-coated pretty little secret was eating everybody alive

Well daddy's reading propaganda
And he's talking 'bout the end of days
Well cheers to the vodka mama's been sneakin'
Let's all gather 'round and pray

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush

So I snuck out behind the red barn
And I took myself a toke
Since everybody here hates everybody here
Hell I might as well be the joke

I'm gonna dance up on the table
Singing "This Little Light of Mine"
God gave it to me, what good's it gonna do me
If I don't, by God, let it shine

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush

Hide your tattoo, put on your Sunday best
Pretend you're not a mess, be the happy family in the front pew

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush
Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush

Best to keep it hush, hush


Hey girl, what's your name girl
I've been looking at you
And every guy here's doing the same girl
It'd be a shame girl
If I let you just walk on by
Cause I'm all caught up in your sweet smile
A girl like you comes around once in a while
So hot, got to give it a shot
Gotta get get a little bit of what you got


I know you don't know me but I can't leave here lonely
Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl but who could blame me
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is


Hey girl, what you think girl
You look a little thirsty let me go get you something to drink girl
Before you blink girl
I'll be right back by your side
And if you want we can roll out
I know my way around this town
I got a shotgun seat for you
You can tell me where it is you want to take off to


I know you don't know me but I can't leave here lonely
Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl but who could blame me
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is


Ooh, baby you're still standing here
I guess you must like what you hear
Hey girl, what you say girl
About you and me getting away girl


I know you don't know me but I can't leave here lonely
Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl but who could blame me
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is


You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is
Hey girl
Oh yeah

Wake in the morning and we're up and gone, before the dawn
Telephones, Traffic lights, Work all day, Work all night
We're too young to let life pass us by
Let's Run Away tonight

And Make Sweet love under the stars
Dancing to a heartbeat alone in the dark
Fall asleep in in each others arms and just dream
Baby Run Away with me

Remember when we use to say we'd never rush, now look at us
We're running down a dream we swore we'd never chase
What a waste of time we could be spending together
We should be doing something better

Like Making Sweet love under the stars
Dancing to a heartbeat alone in the dark
Fall asleep in in each others arms and just dream
Baby Run Away with me

Run Away (Run Away)
Run Away (Run Away)
Run Away (Run Away)
Run Away hey

Making Sweet love under the stars
Dancing to a heartbeat alone in the dark
Fall asleep in in each others arms and just dream
Baby Run Away with

Making Sweet love under the stars
Dancing to a heartbeat alone in the dark
Fall asleep in in each others arms and just dream
Baby Run Away with me


Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head telling me that we're no good


But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no


Tomorrow I'll be stronger
I'm not gonna break down and call you up when my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
But when I pass your house, I won't stop no matter how bad I want to


But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no

Tomorrow


Baby when we're good, you know we're great
But there's too much bad for us to think
There's anything worth trying to save


But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no

Tomorrow, I'm gonna leave here
And I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would


Close your eyes
And picture this
Lyin' in bed in the candlelight
We start to kiss


I'm pulling your body in close to mine, now picture us
That moment before we make love


Now hold that thought
Hold it right there
Let your mind keep runnin' wild
'Til I get there
Just imagine
Me lovin' on you all night long
Can you see it, feel it?
Girl, are you there yet?
Now, hold that thought


I wish that I
Was already home
'Cause girl I've been thinkin' about tonight
All day long


So why don't you lay back and fantasize about me and you
And everything we're gonna do


And hold that thought
Hold it right there
Let your mind keep runnin' wild
'Til I get there
Just imagine
Me lovin' on you all night long
Can you see it, feel it?
Girl, are you there yet?
Now, hold that thought


Just imagine
Me lovin' on you all night long
I can you see it, feel it
Girl, are you there yet?
Now, hold that thought
'Cause, girl, I'm almost... home


She was sittin' on the park bench feedin' pigeons on Beacon Hill
I was takin' my dog Jack out for a run, we had little time to kill
I still don't know if it was Jack or me that somehow caught her eye
But the next thing I knew, we were sittin' there talking, laughing, into the night
And from that moment on she never left my side
Those autumn nights were long
She was the first love of my life


I still can feel the softness of her hair falling on my face
My arms all around her
There's always something 'bout this time of year
It takes me to that place
And I remember November


She was workin' her way through school
Waitin' tables at the Hungry Eye
I was playin' a club down on the waterfront
After work she'd come by
Around 3AM we'd grab some take-out in the heart of Chinatown
Then we'd hang out and stay up all night just talkin' and messin' around
I never would have dreamed we'd ever say goodbye
She felt like the sun to me on those cold November nights




Lookin' back I can't explain what happened
On that dark December day
I guess we were just two kids goin' different ways




And I remember November

You got your hair down
You got that look in your eye
That says come here and get me boy
Lay me down and love me just right, yeah
Ain’t goin no where
I got a bottle of wine
I got nothin’ but time on my hands
And I’m gonna be your man tonight, ah yes I am

I can’t imagine doin’ nothin but what I’m doin
Just layin’ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin’ on a little something
I need your lovin’
Just keep them kisses comin’

It’s been a long week
I’ve been missin’ me some you
All I wanna do is get your lips on mine
Girl if you only knew, hey

I can’t imagine doin’ nothin but what I’m doin
Just layin’ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin’ on a little something
I need your lovin’
Just keep them kisses comin’
Yeah keep ‘em comin’ all night

Don’t stop killin’ me baby
Don’t stop drivin’ me crazy
I swear there’s honey on your lips
Baby give me one more long slow kiss

I can’t imagine doin’ nothin but what I’m doin
Just layin’ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin’ on a little something
I need your lovin’
Just keep them kisses comin’
Oh keep ‘em comin’ all night, hey


Maybe it was the moonlight
The scent of you on the breeze
Maybe it was your shadow that fell over me
Such a beautiful stranger
Eyes darker than coal
Your first look crossed the desert
Into my soul


Mi Corzon perdido en ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
Oh my heart is lost to you


Maybe it was the music
The way it moved with your hair
Or the heat of the moment
That hung in the air
But when I saw you there dancing
Mesmerized by the gaze
There was some kind of magic
That led me away



Rocking around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly" Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly" Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way


If you're reading this, my Momma's sitting there
Looks like I only got a one way ticket over here
Sure wish I could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids


I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you


So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home


If you're reading this
Half way around the world
I won’t be there
To see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
Stand up for the innocent and weak


I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes


So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home


If you're reading this
There’s going to come a day
When you'll move on
And find someone else
And that's OK
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace
And angels sing amazing grace


So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home


Tell the children of Abraham
There's a star over Bethlehem
And the light in the manger
Come a Christmas morn
When baby Jesus is born


Angel came to Mary
Said, I'm telling you
The light of this world
Is shining inside of you
His sweet forgiveness
Going to set men free
The lame will walk
And the blind will see




Wise men following a holy light
Shepherds heard singing
In the midnight sky
And they all came a running
Through the stable door
The meek and the mighty
The rich and the poor



If I had it my way
This would be the first time that I made love
And I would be the first girl that your hands touched

We've both done our share of living
Taking chances we've been given
I've never been too big on looking back

I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last

If I could do it over
I'd have waited for this moment
So I could give my heart to you unbroken

But if our mistakes brought us together
Does it really matter whether
We were saints or sinners in the past?

I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last

All I know is what I see when I look at you
And all I see is what I'm feeling down inside
And all I'm feeling is the feeling that I finally got it right

When I wake up tomorrow
I'm going to wrap my arms around you
Thank my lucky stars I found you

'Cause I know your heart has so much more than
Anyone has touched before and
Nothing matters more to me than that

I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last

In the back of the bottom drawer
Of the dresser by our bed
Is a box of odds and ends that I have always kept
But the man who sleeps beside me
Doesn't know it's even there
Little pieces of my past
That I shouldn't have to share

A napkin that is stained with time
Has a poem on it that didn't quite rhyme, but it made me cry
In a "Dear Jane" letter from a different guy
He broke up with me and he told me I'm not always right
And a stolen key from an old hotel room door
In the back of the bottom drawer

I don't keep these things 'cause I'm longing to go back
I keep them because I want to stay right where I'm at
I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs
I don't want to mess this up
But I wouldn't know where I belong
Without this box of stuff

A birthday card from my first boyfriend
He signed it "I love you" so I gave in
Yeah, we went too far in his daddy's car
And those Mardi Gras beads from '98
We danced all night, stayed out so late
We thought we were stars, closing down the bars
That champagne was cheap but still I've got that cork
In the back of the bottom drawer

I'm not trying to hide these things from the man I love today
But I'm a better woman for him, thanks to my yesterdays

So now I try to give more than I take
And I bite my tongue, fight the urge to say it's my way
Or no way at all
And now I cherish love a whole lot more
'Cause of what's
In the back of the bottom drawer

I sure could use an attaboy or a big old high five
I'd love to hear "you're killing it, dude", yeah it's been a long time
Since I hit one out of the park or nailed it as they say
I guess I've been in a dry spell but that's about to change

Cause every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, yeah I'll be crushin' it

They say your baby's mad cause you told her that you'd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed late last spring of you and her in Florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head, looks at you and says
"Ain't you good for anything?" and you say

Every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
You want a margarita, I'll get Tequila and ice
And I'll be crushin' it, with a cold one in my other hand
I'll be crushin' it, when I'm finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot, crunch it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead, yeah I got this
I'll be crushin' it, oh I'll be crushin' it

I figured this out in college, walking past them Gothic columns
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best and brightest guy around
But like the great George freakin Strait, I'm the king of getting unwound

And every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, every weekend's a weekend
Yeah I'll be crushin' it, by this time Friday night
I'll be crushin' it, I'll be done with my third can
Oh, I'll be crushin' it, of cold Bud Light
I'll be crushin' it, I'll be crushin' it


I like chocolate
But my hips sure don’t
I like drinking red wine
But tomorrow my head sure won’t
These are just some things that I love that are bad for me

I like shopping
But my purse sure don’t
I like wearing high heels
But tomorrow my feet sure won’t
These are just some things that I love that are bad for me


But of all the things
I shouldn’t do
Number one is loving you

There’s a fatal charm
In your faithless arms
Why is everything that feels so dang good
Bad for me


I like fast cars
But the law sure don’t
I like partying late
But tomorrow my boss sure won’t
These are just some things that I love that are bad for me




Oh, I like danger
But common sense sure don’t
Tonight I like your sweet lies
But tomorrow my heart sure won’t
These are just some things that I love that are bad for me




Boy you’re one of those
Things I love
But you’re bad for me
So bad for me


I want him but he don't want me
He wants somebody else that I can't be
And she's got a man that she wants to leave
'Cause he can't seem to make her happy
Does it have to be wrong to make it feel right
Tell me why ain't nobody satisfied


Old man looking at a photograph
Of a love that's long gone from his past
And his wife's got a letter that she can't read
From a boy who never came back from the sea
All these secrets are lies we keep deep inside
Does it have to be wrong to make it feel right
Tell me why ain't nobody satisfied, yeah


See that man walking down the street
Yeah what are the odds he's the one for me
And what if I pass him by and he's got the love I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me why ain't nobody satisfied


I want him but he don't want me
He wants somebody else that I can't be
And she's got a man that she wants to leave
'Cause he can't seem to make her happy
See that man walking down the street
Yeah what are the odds he's the one for me
And what if I pass him by and he's got the love I need

She likes it when I call in sick to work
Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doing what she likes
She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doing what she likes


She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes


She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doing what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doing what she likes


She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes


She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwing words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doing what she likes
Doing what she likes


She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes


Yeah, I like doing what she likes
Hmm, yeah


I'm still running thirty-threes up underneath this truck, even though
Rush hour concrete's the only place I'm getting stuck
Ain't on the farm no more but on a stretch of sunny days
I still catch myself looking up at the sky
Praying for a little rain


No, I can't outrun these roots
Even if I wanted to
Cause they run too strong, run too deep
Cutting right through the heart of me
No, it don't matter where I plant these boots
I can't outrun these roots
I can't outrun these roots


There's still that back home part of me
That can't help but see things a little different
Like how there ain't no need
To put a 'G' on the end of huntin' or fishin'
And I still got granddaddy's bible, his old rifle, and his name
But I also got his "pour a little more"
Coursin' through my veins


No, I can't outrun these roots
Even if I wanted to
Cause they run too strong, run too deep
Cutting right through the heart of me
No, it don't matter where I plant these boots
I can't outrun these roots


Thank God I can't
They're tangled up in every part of who I am
Without 'em I know I don't stand a chance
I can't outrun these roots
I can't outrun these roots


Cause they run too strong, run too deep
Cutting right through the heart of me
No, it don't matter where I plant these boots
I can't outrun these roots
I can't outrun these roots


I dropped to my knees in that field on your daddy's farm
Asked you to marry me, all I had to give was my heart
While other kids went diving into swimming holes
You and me dove off into the great unknown
We were barely getting by, taking care of each other
Then I became a daddy; you became a mother
Was an uphill battle nearly every day
Looking back I wouldn't have it any other way


I'm proud of the house we built
It's stronger than sticks, stones, and steel
It's not a big place sitting up high on some hill
A lot of things will come and go but love never will
Oh, I'm proud
I'm proud of the house we built


Still working our way through the land of milk and honey
At the end of the day there's always more bills than money
I close my eyes at night and I still feel
The same fire in my heart I felt out in that field




Oh, look at us today
Oh, we've come such a long long way




It's two tickets to a concert
It's a Daytona airbrush T-shirt
Wondering who's gonna kiss you first
You know what I'm talking about


Hey baby, whatcha doing tonight?
It's butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes
Of a beach towel in a Spring Break town


It's playing in the night air
Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just living
That American country love song


In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on and on and on


It's Chris loves Jenny on a license plate
It's daddy getting mad cause you came home late
It's one last kiss in the driveway
Hey, radio DJ can you play that song that she loves
So I can turn it up and maybe turn her on
An American country love song


In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on, and on, and on, and on


So let's raise a glass, cheerleaders and quarterbacks
Cowboys and country girls, all around this small town world
To the same old pick up lines, we've tried a million times
All the bad and good as it gets
To the ones that you ain't met yet


In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on, and on, and on


I can do most anything a man can do
I can hold my liquor with the best to you
Even take your money in a game of pool
Yeah
I'd kick your butt
If I wanted to

And I don't mind when people cuss in front of me
The truth is
I don't blush that much at anything
But I still got this little girl inside of me
That likes to be treated like a queen


And I know I dont act much like a lady
But I still need to be somebody's baby
Yeah
You might find me making too much noise
But I'm more than just one of the boys
Yeah
I'm more than just one of the boys


God knows I ain't never been the clingy type
Looking for a man to make it all alright
But I don't mind admitting
Sometimes late at night
Well, I need someone to hold me tight


And I know I dont act much like a lady
But I still need to be somebody's baby
Yeah
You might find me making too much noise
But
I'm more than just one of the boys
Yeah
I'm more than just one of the boys


Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
It's a beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
And here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town


Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
We'll face unafraid
The plan that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland


In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Jim Ed Brown
We'll sing "Pop A Top" with Mr. Snowman
When chapel bells are ringing all around




Yeah we'll face unafraid
That plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland


Rollin' rollin' here they come
Outta pickup trucks into the clubs
Sweet little small town hotties
(so hot)
From the hollar from the sticks
In cowboy boots and blue jean hips
Jacked up and ready to party


Got the cold bear flowin
Hey, get em going DJ


They'll start shakin' that tailgate
Round and round
Back it on up and down to the ground
This honkeytonks on fire
Come on now come on now
It dont matter whatcha call it
Its all about the way they haul it
Them country girls can't wait
To start shakin' that tailgate
(shakin' that tailgate)


Its wall to wall their packin in
Girls hangin' out with all their friends
Rockin' and ready to unwind
(here we go)
On the tables on the bar
It don't matter where they are
Ain't nothin' here but a good time


Got the cold beer flowin'
Hey, get em goin' DJ


They'll start shakin' that tailgate
Round n round
Back it on up and down to the ground
This honkeytonks on fire
Come on now, come on now
It don't matter whatcha call it
Its all about the way they haul it
Them country girls can't wait
To start shakin' that (tailgate)

Shakin' that tailgate
Round 'n round
Back it on up and down to the ground
This honkeytonks on fire
Come on now come on now
It don't matter whatcha call it
Its all about the way they haul it
Them country girls can't wait to start shakin that tailgate
(shakin that tailgateaaaat)
Shakin' that, shakin' that, shakin' that, shakin' that
Shakin' that, shakin' that, shakin' that, shakin' that
Shakin' that tailgate


You're like a screen flashing, insufficient funds
Cops knocking when the party's just begun
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat
You're a cell phone splashing in my coffee cup
A fumble on the one when my team was going up
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know


You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill


I used to do everything I could do to do nice things
No matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change
Everybody knows you ended us
So why you showing up here on my side of the tracks?
Slipping in this bar just to check out where I'm at
I was a six pack in, now I'm as sober as a judge, cause


You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill


As if it didn't hurt enough, now I got to see you flirt
Nailed to the stool, watching you work
Don't you give a damn about how I feel
You little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're such a buzzkill


You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill


I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what I say
It's almost like ain't it me that keeps pushing you away
How any nights have you laid here with me feeling like I left?
Waking up in a stranger's bed
Don't know how I got lost
I don't know how to get back
Don't know how you haven't hit the door with your bags all packed
Every morning I hear you pray for the old me
Instead of waking up, in a stranger's bed


I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a strangers bed


I know I say too little
Yeah, I'm gone too much
I don't even remember the last time we touched
Every night it's like you're sleeping with someone you've never met
And waking up in a strangers bed
I remember the words that you haven't heard for so long
You're not gone yet


I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a strangers bed
Oh no, oh woah


I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what i say
It's almost like it ain't me that keeps pushing you away


I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
Well, I'm gonna run back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed
Ooh


Man you ever just wanna, go ridin' around
No worries, well that's this kind of song
Yeah alright


This is for everybody out there, circlin' the town square
Proud to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere
USA, Chevrolet, Dodge and Ford
Raisin' a little hell and praising the Lord (yes sir)
Just simple truth speakin', workin' for the weekend
Every time it hits the fan you just keep on keepin'
You tried and true, red white and blue
Turn it up, turn it up, man, this one’s for you, woo


Hey, this is for the drivin' around
Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road
Turning up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into Main Street
Cruisin' the same streets
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along
To this drivin' around song


Yeah, I know what I’m talkin' about
I grew up in them rural routes
Counting down them days 'til I got brave enough to bust out
City lights in my sights, I’m gonna do it up right
I’m sittin' here with this guitar tonight, alright
Kickin' it in the big town, wishin' I'd a slowed it down
And I give anything if I was drivin' around
With the big dreams in my pocket
Yeah, this is for the ones who don’t know how good they got it


Hey, this is for the drivin' around
Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road
Turning up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into Main Street
Cruisin' the same streets
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along
To this drivin' around song


Alright, everybody
Get in your truck, get in your car, whatever it is, (hey hey hey)
Small town America, baby
We’re goin' drive it around


Hey, this is for the drivin' around
Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road
Turnin' up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into Main Street, that's right
Cruisin' the same streets
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along, just singin' along
To this drivin' around song
Hey, hey this is for the drivin' around, Jack and Diane town
To this drivin' around song
Hey, this is for the drivin' around, Jack and Diane town
To this drivin' around song

Hey Mona Lisa, who was Leonardo
Was he Andy Warhol
Were you Marilyn Monroe
Hey Mozart, what kind of name is Amadeus
It's kind of like Elvis
You got to die to be famous

I may not go down in history
I just want someone to remember me

I'll probably never hold a brush that paints a masterpiece
I'll probably never find a pen that writes a symphony
But if I will love then I will find
That I have touched another life
And that's something
Something worth leaving behind

Hey Midas, they say you had the magic touch
But even all that shiny stuff
Someday is gonna turn to dust
Hey Jesus, it must have been some Sunday morning
In a blaze of glory
We're still telling your story

I may not go down in history
I just want someone to remember me

I'll probably never dream a dream and watch it turn to gold
I know I'll never lose my life to save another's soul
But if I will love then I will find
That I have touched another life
And that's something
Something worth leaving behind

Hey baby, see the future that we're building
Our love lives on
In the lives of our children
And that's something
Something worth leaving behind


Some say we're the land of misfit toys
An insane mix of girls and boys
Nothing really changes, like a stretch of sand time forgot


That's just living, that's just living
That's just living life on a rock, yeah


Well you don't lose your lover, you just lose your turn
(yeah, yeah)
Driving on the left side got to be learned
(yeah, yeah)
Happy hours from 3 to 6 but it never really stops


That's just living, that's just living
That's just living life on a rock, yeah


We got Rasta religions, and parrots and pigeons
Mango and salt on a stick
Life is a lime and from time to time
I got to go get my fix, yeah
We roll with the flow, friends come and go
Usually by the edge of the dock


That's just living, that's just living
That's just living life on a rock, yeah
Oh I love living, I love living
I love living  life on a rock, yeah


That's just living, that's just living
That's just living life on a rock, yeah


Life on a rock
Yea yea
Yea yea
I love living
Life on a rock

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just on thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Clause won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you, baby
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer's click
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do, baby?
All I want for Christmas is you, you, baby
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you
All I want, all I really want is you, baby
All I want, all I really want is you, baby

I saw a black man with a bible
And a sparkler in his hand
He was holding a tent revival
And running a firework stand

He said the end of the world is coming
So you better get on your knees
Today bottle rockets are two for one
But salvation's free

He said I quit my job at a big church
Where the milk and money flowed
To sell cherry bombs for Jesus
In a tent beside the road

I ain't in it for the money
Most cars pass on by
But I pay the rent on New Years
And the fourth of July

Here at the Holy Ghost
Big Bang Theory, Pentecostal
Fire and Brimstone
Mission Temple Firework Stand

He said fireworks are dangerous
They can blow up in your face
So you better read the instructions
Light the fuse and get away

These things are made in China
So it's easy to see
How a man who worships Buddha
Ain't got no guarantee

This is the Holy Ghost
Big Bang Theory, Pentecostal
Fire and Brimstone
Mission Temple Firework Stand

He said everything I'm selling
Is all going up in smoke
This world is like an atom bomb
It's ready to explode

When the trumpet sounds and The Lord comes back
I promise you one thing
I'll be a human bottle rocket
And I'll go out with a bang

I'll leave this, Holy Ghost
Big Bang Theory, Pentecostal
Fire and Brimstone
Mission Temple Firework Stand...

The sun came up this morning:
I opened up my window just to hear the birds sing
It feels so good to be alive:
It's been so long since I felt this good inside
I ain't gonna rush, gonna take my time
Gonna drink my coffee in the warm sunshine
A little vacation in my own backyard

Today ain't my day to care
I'll have me a pitcher of margaritas before noon if I want to
I ain't gonna worry an' I don't have to be anywhere:
It ain't my day to care

I think I'll kick around in my robe
I ain't gonna put a lick of make up on my face
Yeah, I might just pull out my old guitar
Just to see if I've still got what it takes
That honeysuckle summer breeze
Gonna take it all in, it smells so sweet
Tomorrow's gonna be here soon enough

But today ain't my day to care
I'll have me a pitcher of Bloody Marys before noon if I want to
I ain't gonna worry an' I don't have to be anywhere:
Ain't my day to care

I'm gonna tend to my soul, pamper myself
Let it all go, get it all out
It's about time
I spent a little time on me

Today ain't my day to care
I'll have me a pitcher of mamosas before noon if I want to
I ain't gonna worry an' I don't have to be anywhere;
I ain't gonna worry an' I don't have to be anywhere:
Ain't my day to care
It ain't my day to care
No, it ain't my day to care

(La la, la la la la la)
(La la, la la la la la, la la)
(La la, la la la la la, la la)

(La la, la la la la la)
(La la, la la la la la, la la)
(La la, la la la la la, la la)

Last thing I said was you need to get over yourself, yeah
And if you can't roll with me I suggest you find somebody else, uh
You knew going in I was a mover and a shaker
But I guess last night was a real deal breaker

Chorus:
I drank for free, I paid no cover
I danced with one cowboy and then another
Too many shots, and then the drummer
Asked for my name and I gave him my number
I probably do it again
Confessions of an ex-girlfriend!
Hey, hey, well I'll admit right now I ain't the kind of girl thatd be like that..
No! And if the store is still open you know I gotta shop around, and I do
I'm just a sweet Southern thing that loves to mix and mingle
But nights like that might explain why I'm single

Chorus:
I drank for free, I paid no cover
I dance with one cowboy and then another
Too many shots, and then the drummer
Asked for my name and I gave him my number
I probably do it again
Confessions of an ex-girlfriend!
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah
I drank for free and I paid no cover
But I love them cowboys, yeah I do!
I drank for free, I paid no cover
I dance with one cowboy and then another
Too many shots, and then the drummer
Asked for my name and I gave him my number
I probably do it again
Confessions of an ex-girlfriend!
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah


Got a baby girl sleeping in my bedroom
And her mama laughing in my arms
There's the sound of rain on the rooftop
And the game's about to start


I don't really know how I got here
But I'm sure glad that I did
And it's crazy to think that one little thing
Could've changed all of it

Maybe it didn't turn out like I planned
Maybe that's why I'm such, such a lucky man


For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to
This


Like the girl that I loved in high school
Who said she could do better
Or that college I wanted to go to
Till I got that letter


All the fights and the tears and the heartache
I thought I'd never get through
And the moment I almost gave up
All lead me here to you

I didn't understand it way back when
But sitting here right now it all makes perfect sense


For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this


How I cried when my mama passed away
But now I've got an angel looking out for me today
So nothing's a mistake


For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this


It led me here to
This

It'll creep up on you like a kudzu vine
Even miles above the Mason-Dixon line
'Til one day you're craving hominy grits
And scanning the jukebox for George Jones hits
Drinkin' Jack Black tryin' to kick back
'Til the condo's looking like a shotgun shack
You'll be one of us no matter where you're at
When it all goes south

When it all goes south
(You'll be drivin' around on a John Deere tractor)
When it all goes south
(Wearing baseball caps but they won't be backwards)
Now it really don't matter what state you're in
One day the south's gonna rise again

There's a Wall Street wonderboy sittin' up north
Throwing darts like a monkey at a stock report
He's got two homes, car loans, in debt
And his third divorce ain't even final yet
Traded his MBA for a SUV
On a backwoods road down in Tennessee
'Cause man Manhattan ain't the place to be

When it all goes south
(With the live oak trees and the sweet magnolias)
When it all goes south
(Eatin' moon pies, drinking RC colas)
Now it really don't matter what state you're in
Someday the south's gonna rise again

Vicksburg, Birmingham, Natchez
And Savannah, Panama City
Y'all sure look pretty in the sunshine
Gettin' dixiefried
Get yourself some rebel pride

When it all goes south
(Where the fog's as thick as Mississippi mud)
When it all goes south
(You'll be singing the blues 'cause it's in your blood)
Now it really don't matter what state you're in
One day the south's gonna rise again
When it all goes south

When it all goes south
(Where the fog's as thick as Mississippi mud)
When it all goes south
(You'll be singing the blues 'cause it's in your blood)...

I like my fun every bit as much as anyone
But I want a love that's real
Somehow you know
How to get inside this heart of gold
Real smooth, real slow
I should turn & leave but
You feel so good to me mercy me

What's a good ol' girl supposed to do
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
There's no limit to the trouble I could get into
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
Oh a boy like you

My neck, your lips
You're startin' fires with your fingertips
I can't resist givin' in completely
I can't stop lovin you lovin' me

What's a good ol' girl supposed to do
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
There's no limit to the trouble I could get into
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
Oh a boy like you

Makin' love so sweetly you feel so good to me
Mercy me, mercy me, mercy me!

What's a good ol' girl supposed to do
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
There's no limit to the trouble I could get myself into
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
Oh a boy like you

What's a good ol' girl supposed to do
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
There's no limit to the trouble I could get myself into
With a boy like you (bad, bad boy like you)
Oh a boy like you

I knew this kid, his name was Micheal
He was only 4 years old
We sat on a rock and started talkin'
And he told me things I didn't know
He said yesterday he was Indian
And how he played with buffalo
Well i got the send that he had been there
And he made me really want to go

Chorus:
I remember waiting all year for December
Thought God was crying when it rained
That the stars were fireflies
Dreams were real and big as life
It was forever, everyday

I was tuckin' in my little girl
She held my hand and we said a prayer
I prayed, "Bless Grandma with the angels"
And she said, "Hey Mom, shes standin over there"
Well, I couldn't see her but I don't doubt it
Maybe 'cause I'm older and less wise
What if Heavens all around us
But only seen through children's eyes

(Repeat Chorus)
They say when your older your a child again
But do we have to wait 'till then

(Repeat Chorus)
Forever
Knew this kid his name was micheal

Can't nobody love you like I do
Not now, no not ever
There ain't no doubt I know this thing
We have, could last forever
Others may promise the stars in the sky
But sooner or later you'll find
Can't nobody love you like I do
Can't nobody hold you quite this close
All night like I want to
Baby, put your sweet lips here on mine
You'll see 'cause I'm gonna show you
Just how an angel like you should be loved
I can't feel you enough
Can't nobody love you like I do
Can't nobody love you like I do
Who knows when it's meant to be
Well, love knows and it sent you to me
You don't know how I live for the day
You look at me and you say
Can't nobody love you like I do
Can't nobody love you like I do
Can't nobody love you like I do


I grab your hand and you say “Wait”
I say “No girl, it’s way too late”
We’ve been playing games for weeks
Now I’m ready to play for keeps


Oh, tonight, we’re gonna set the world on fire
And I’m gonna set aside my pride
Not gonna be the one to say “Goodbye”
Neither am I
Oh, tonight


So go on, kiss me on the mouth
You know you want to and you should’ve done it by now
Girl, you don’t know how long I’ve tried
I've been fighting feelings deep inside


Oh, tonight, we’re gonna set the world on fire
And I’m gonna set aside my pride
Not gonna be the one to say “Goodbye”
Well, neither am I
But oh, tonight


So tell me what you want me to do
Oh, it’s too late baby, I’ve already fallen in love with you


Oh, tonight, we’re gonna set the world on fire
And I’m gonna set aside my pride
Not gonna be the one to say “Goodbye”
Well, neither am I
Oh, tonight, we’re gonna set the world on fire
And I’m gonna set aside my pride
Not gonna be the one to say “Goodbye”
Neither am I
Oh, tonight


It's not easy
Trying to understand
How the world can be so cold
Stealing the souls of man
Cloudy skies rain down
On all your dreams
You wrestle with the fear and doubt
Sometimes it's hard, but you got to believe


There's a better place
Where our Father waits
And every tear
He'll wipe away
The darkness will be gone
The weak shall be strong
Hold on to your faith
There will come a day
There will come a day


Wars are raging
Lives are scattered
Innocence is lost
And hopes are shattered
The old are forgotten
The children are forsaken
In this world we're living in
Isn't anything sacred




Song will ring out
Down those golden streets
The voices of earth
The angels will sing
Every knee will bow
Sin will have no trace
In the glory of His amazing grace
Every knee will bow
Sin will have no trace
In the glory of His amazing grace
There will come a day
There will come a day
Oh, there will come a day
There will come a day
I know there's coming a day
Coming a day


Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
In the same night


There's ball caps, photographs, dollar bills and bras
License plates from every state nailed up to the wall
Spring breakers, heart breakers, already getting loud
Talladega's on the big screen, don't it make you proud?


Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the redneck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama
At the Flora-Bama


There's hot time, low tide, years of history
Hurricanes with different names that almost took the beach
The sign that says "live your life" just for inspiration
Gonna raise a lot of hell tonight in the, in the no shoes nation


Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the redneck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama
At the Flora-Bama


Got your "who that?", go Vols, roll tide and the Seminoles
Old dogs, war eagle, green-eyed gator, that's barely legal


Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the redneck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama
At the Flora-Bama


Don't it feel good?
Don't it feel good?
Yeah, don't it feel good?
At the Flora-Bama
Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Sitting here at the Flora-Bama


His early morning attitude
You have to drag him out of bed
Only frosted flakes will do


He gets that from me
Yeah, he gets that from me


His curly hair and his knobby knees
The way the sun brings those freckles out
Talk and talk and never miss a beat


Yeah, he gets that from me
He gets that from me


He looks at me with those big brown eyes
He's got me in the palm of his hands
And I swear sometimes
It's just like you're here again
He smiles that little crooked smile
There's no denying he's your child
Without him, I don't know what I'd do


He gets that from you
Oh, he gets that from you


How he loves your old guitar
Yeah, he's taught himself to play
He melts my heart
Tells me he loves me every day
And cracks a joke at the perfect time
Makes me laugh when I want to cry
That boy is everything to me


He gets that from you
He gets that from you


Last night I heard him pray
"Lord, help me and Momma make it through
And tell Daddy we'll be okay"


He said he sure misses you
He sure misses you
He really misses you
He gets that from me

She's the last girl I thought I'd ever see here
But there stands the preacher's daughter holdin' a beer
A tatoo of an angel on the small of her back
How cool.... is that

She probably don't remember me, it's been a long long time
About then she turned around and kinda stared at me and smiled
She said I had the hots for you in Sunday school class
Now tell me how cool.... is that

How cool...... is the hot sunlight
When the stars line up and everything feels just right
How cool...... when no-ones in sight
When I'm the one shes lookin' at with that look in her eye

About then I asked if she was still seein' old what's his name
She said has it really been that long, no... a lot of things have changed
She brushed her hair back and said let's not talk about the past
How cool..... is that

How cool.... is the hot sunlight
When the stars line up and everything feels just right
How cool.... when no-ones in sight
When I'm the one shes lookin' at with that look in her eye


Misty sunrise in my hometown
Rows of cotton about knee high
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road
Still got clothes out on the line

Erwin Nichols there
With Judsley playin checkers at the gin
When I dream about the Southland
This is where it all begins


From Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll Tide Roll

Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on


Catching catfish on the river
Chasing fireflies by the creek
Kissing Gabby Williams' sister
On the porch homecoming week

With rusted cars and weeping willows
Keeping watch out in the yard
Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie
Could be anywhere you are


In Carolina or in Georgia
Open arms are waiting for you
Louisiana
Yellow Rose of San Antone

Arkansas
Mississippi
Old man river whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on


As I sit here
I'm surrounded by these priceless memories
I don't have to think about it
There's no place I'd rather be
Than


Carolina or in Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama Roll Tide Roll

Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on

I worked all week to make me some money
Bring it back to Mama, best give me some honey yeah
Cashed my check, got a pocket of dollar
Loosenin' the buttons on my blue collar yeah

Oh, this is what I do
This is where I stand
This is who I am

Living the song of a ramblin' man
Gettin' it done with my own two hands
Puttin' some green in a coffee can
For when I'm gone, when I'm gone

Trickin' my truck like a Cadillac
Crankin' it up in my cowboy hat
Rollin' and bumpin' to the Man in Black
Singin' along, I've got my country on

Rollin' it home five o' clock on a Friday
Gonna spend the next couple of days doin' it my way yeah, oh, yeah
Call up a few friends, build a fire in the backyard
Gonna do some chillin', chicken grillin', and guitars yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, this is all I know
This is where I'm from
This is what I love

Living the song of a ramblin' man
Gettin' it done with my own two hands
Puttin' some green in a coffee can
For when I'm gone, when I'm gone

Trickin' my truck like a Cadillac
Crankin' it up in my cowboy hat
Rollin' and bumpin' to the Man in Black
Singin' along, I've got my country on

Got my country on

I got a good piece of ground that my granddaddy gave me
Down the road from the church where the Good Lord saved me yeah

Living the song of a ramblin' man
Gettin' it done with my own two hands
Puttin' some green in a coffee can
For when I'm gone, when I'm gone

Trickin' my truck like a Cadillac
Crankin' it up in my cowboy hat
Rollin' and bumpin' to the Man in Black
Singin' along, I've got my country on (Got my country on)
I've got my country on
Got my country on, yeah, woo!
Oh, got my country on
Yes, I do, woo!


She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done


And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster


The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back


And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster


She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her


When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster

I grew up here where there ain't much blacktop
The headlights on the interstate don't stop
Any man worth his weight plows a straight row
And all the money is the grain in the silo

And there's just enough home grown pretty girls
Growin' up around here that like to sip cold beer
It's a blink and you miss it kind of town
The kind of place that makes the world go round

My wheels have rolled all this red dirt
My hands have got scars from the hard work
Me and my friends unwind on the outskirts
Our Friday nights might get a little black and blue

I'm out here ridin' high on a lift kit
I see the world through a crack where a rock hit
I am who I am I do what I do
Lookin' at life from a broken windshield view

A truck bed's got a half roll of barb wire
A bale of hay and a patched up spare tire
Cross on a chain hangin' from a rearview
Fifth in a brown paper sack packin'eighty proof

Well sun droppin' off into that cornfield
Thunderhead lightnin' comin' right behind it
These two lane roads ain't paved in gold
Man flyin' gravel's all I know

My wheels have rolled all this red dirt
My hands have got scars from the hard work
Me and my friends unwind on the outskirts
Our Friday nights might get a little black and blue

I'm out here ridin' high on a lift kit
I see the world through a crack where a rock hit
I am who I am I do what I do
Lookin' at life from a broken windshield view

Yeah, c'mon

Yeah, It's a blink and you miss it kind of town
The kind of place that makes the world go round

My wheels have rolled all this red dirt
My hands have got scars from the hard work
Me and my friends unwind on the outskirts
Our Friday nights might get a little black and blue

I'm out here ridin' high on a lift kit
I see the world through a crack where a rock hit
I am who I am I do what I do
Lookin' at life from a broken windshield view

I am who I am I do what I do
Lookin' at life from a broken windshield view

From a broken windshield view

Yeah


Laying with my lady on the riverbank
She looked over lazy, and she gave me a wink
She said: "there's no sense a working if it's this dang hot"
So dip your toes in the water, baby this is the spot


Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride


Well, I bought a scratch off ticket
Well, the winning kind
Well, I saw them lucky sevens in that checkout line
I got a twelve pack, big sack
Carton of smokes
Now I'm dancing like I just saw the Holy Ghost


Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride


You got them weekend warriors
Partying all night long
You got them moonshine lovers
Just getting it on
Does it make you feel happy?
Does it make your heart beat?
Does it make you shake it honey?
Does it make you move your feet?


Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride

Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride

Dang the sun, dang this day
I'm just tryin' to stay outta your danged ol' way
To heck with this, to heck with us
And shoot if I'll ever look back on where I've been
Shoot if I'll ever give away my heart again

Love you, love this town
Love this mother lovin' truck
That keeps breakin' lovin' down
There's only one four letter word that'll do
Love you

Love your cat, love this house
Well, I can't believe myself that I'm lovin' gettin' out
Love talkin', love fightin'
The thought of never seein' your lovin' face
There's some words that some words just have to replace

Love you, love this town
Yeah, I'm sick and lovin' tired
Of all your lovin' around
There's only one four letter word that'll do
Love you

Love you, love this town
And I'm sick an' lovin' tired
Of all your lovin' around
There's only one four-letter word that'll do

Love you, love this town
Love this mother lovin' truck
That keeps breakin' lovin' down
There's only one four letter word that'll do

Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you, honey


Sitting on the front step, little white suitcase
Hearing that diesel, 'fore it hit the front gate
His headlights burning down a Friday night
Southern bell statue standing in the screen door
Watching her whole world head for an old Ford
With a man that can't look her in the eye


Then I'll run to him, big hug, jump in
And I cry for her out the window


Some mamas and daddies are loving in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies
Let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle


Bowling alley burger, fries and a milkshake
Headed to the same old two dollar matinee
Baby, how's your school been and how's your mom?
Patsy Cline echoes back off the dashboard
Staring at my boots and the dusty old floorboard
Baby two weeks ain't really all that long


Then I'll run to her
Wrap my arms around her skirt
And I cry for him out the window


Some mamas and daddies are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies
Let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle
In a love triangle, yeah


Some mamas and daddies are loving in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies
Let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some mamas and daddies ran out of love in '94
And some mamas and daddies don't even talk no more
And some mamas and daddies
Let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck and some of us grow up
In a love triangle

You can lay right here beside me, like there ain't nothing wrong
Kill the light and say goodnight and turn the tv off
Act as if I don't know what it is that you can't find the words to say
Aw baby you can leave or you can stay
You're gone either way

We can share the bed and share the rent but this house ain't a home
And if I'm gonna be lonely I'd just assume be alone
How can you say you love me when you can't even look me in the face
Stay right here and disappear without a trace
You're gone either way

I don't need the hurt from hangin' on to someone who's got one foot out the door
And I can't waste another minute of my love if you don't love me anymore
No, no, no

Naw, don't need the hurt from hangin' on to someone who's got one foot out the door
I can't waste another minute of my love if you don't love me anymore

Don't know why you sit here with me, we both know the truth
You just worry 'bout what leavin' me would make people think of you
It don't matter what your mamma or your daddy or your preacher's got to say
Girl you can hit that door or waste another day
What kind of difference would it make
You're gone either way
Girl you're gone either way
So just get on

In God's time
A million years might only be a single day
And everything He does gets done His own way
In God's time

And in God's time
You'll find that certain someone you've been praying for
And they'll be everything you dreamed of and a little more
In God's time

Oh, but no one knows
Not you or me
It might be tomorrow or it might never be
Oh, but don't lose faith
Put it in His hands
'Cause it might be that He might have a bigger plan
Than you had in mind
Miracles happen
In God's time

And in God's time
You'll finally get the chance to hold your baby girl
And all the sudden everything'll make sense in this crazy world
In God's time

Oh, but no one knows
Not you or me
It might be tomorrow or it might never be
Oh, but don't lose faith
Put it in His hands
'Cause it might be that He might have a bigger plan
Than you had in mind
Miracles happen
In God's time

And In God's time
You go to sleep and wake up with wings and learn to fly
And you finally meet your loved ones on the other side
In God's time

Good morning beautiful how was your night
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I opened my eyes and see your sweet face
Its a good morning beautiful day

I couldn't see the light
I didn't know day from night
I had no reason to care
Well since you came along
I can face the dawn
Cause I know you'll be there

Good morning beautiful how was your night
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I opened my eyes and see your sweet face
Its a good morning beautiful day

I never worry if it's raining outside
Cause in here with you girl the sun always shines

Good morning beautiful how was your night
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I opened my eyes and see your sweet face
Its a good morning beautiful day
Good morning beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Good morning day
What a beautiful day


Don't think "I'm sorry" what we need to say
Don't think forgiveness is why we're here today
Guilty, we're both guilty, let's walk through that door
A second chance is what I'm talking about
Let's take the hurt and turn it inside out
Lay it on me baby until I can't take anymore


No mercy, show me no mercy
Love me all night long and don't hurry
Take it slow and easy, no mercy tonight
Hold me baby, you know I've been hurting
Love this love back to life cause it's worth it
Love me strong baby, show me no mercy tonight


Remember when we thought that being apart
Would be the best thing for both our hearts
It's a prison out there when you're living
Alone for sure
Now I know how much I really missed you
No more games, just want to be with you
Just give me all your love
Till you can't give anymore




In the silence of the early hours
I look at you and I feel the power
Don't need promises to make it right
Let's just follow what we're feeling inside



Mr. Bartender could you pour me one round
Something strong to turn this frown I’m wearing upside down
Oh please, could you give me the best drink you’ve got
Mr. Bartender take me out with one shot
She left me on Friday; I’m so down and out
I never thought I’d lose her, and be so broken down
And now I’m counting on something to ease this pain I've got
Mr. Bartender, take me out with one shot
How about some blended whiskey or some high-octane rum
I’m in need of a stiff drink to make these feelings all go numb
I’m counting on something to ease this pain I’ve got
Mr. Bartender, take me out with one shot
She left me on Friday; I’m so down and out
I never thought I’d lose her, and be so broken down
And now I’m counting on something to ease this pain I've got
Mr. Bartender, take me out with one shot
Yeah, Mr. Bartender, take me out with one shot


There's crime in the city streets
Always trouble in the middle east
How'd they let things get so out of hand?
Just watching the evening news
That would give anybody the blues
The more I know, I think the less I understand


Oh, why can't we all just get a long neck
And make a toast to peace and harmony?
Why, why can't we all just get a long neck
And see how good getting along might be?


I'd like buy the world a round
In a honky tonk on neutral ground
Where we can see, inside we're all the same
Pop a top and let the good times pour
Til we forget what we was fighting for
I'll ask again, can someone please explain?




As different as we may be
We're all one big family
If we just agree
We're going to disagree


Why can't we all just get a long neck
And make a toast to peace and harmony?
Why, why can't we all just get a long neck
And see how good getting along can be?
And see how good getting along could be?

(Verse 1)
She had a dead-end job at the National Bank
And a deadbeat husband who always drank
So when he didn't come home she had the gin to thank
For the tears in her eyes
So Dixie packed up and said her goodbyes and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

(Verse 2)
It's a funny thing when your world falls down
It's got a way of showing you what you're all about
Now Dixie's got her wheels pointed south
And she ain't never looking back
Nobody knew she was brave like that and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

(Bridge)
Yeah Dixie woke up to the truth one day
Grabbed her cheap sunglasses and her lipstick case and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

(Outro)
O-o-oh
The heart of Dixie
O-o-oh

I used to blame it on the clock
'Cause I swear it stops when you're with good friends
An' Billy sayin': "One more shot,"
An' damn that shot always turned to ten
Oh, but I'm afraid the truth
Is if it weren't for me, I'd still have you

I used to blame it on the wind
When it got still it meant the fish were bitin'
Used to think the devil's to blame
For the hell I've raised an' all that fightin'
Yeah it'd make a good excuse:
If it weren't for me, I'd still have you

No, it ain't my fault;
That's a real nice thought;
Only problem is, it just ain't true
An' still I curse the night an' everything in sight:
Anything to keep from feeling like a fool
'Cause if it weren't for me, I'd still have you

I used to point my finger at
The fact that you were born to money
I could never measure up;
No poor boy's love could ever keep you, honey
But a lie won't hide the truth:
If it weren't for me, I'd still have you

No, it ain't my fault;
That's a real nice thought;
Only problem is, it just ain't true
An' still I curse the night an' everything in sight:
Anything to keep from feeling like a fool
'Cause if it weren't for me, I'd still have you

I used to blame it on the clock
'Cause I swear it stops when you're with good friends
An' Billy sayin': "One more shot,"
An' damn that shot always turned to ten


This one's for all you girls about 13
High school can be so rough, can be so mean
Hold onto on to your innocence
Stand your ground when everyone's giving in

This one's for the girls
This is for all you girls about 25
In a little apartment, just trying to get by
Living on on dreams and Spaghetti-O's
Wondering where you life is going to go


This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are

This one's for the girls
Who love without holding back
Who dream with everything they have
All around the world
This one's for the girls


This is for all you girls about 42
Tossing pennies into the Fountain of Youth
Every laugh, laugh line on your face
Made you who you are today


This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are


Yeah, we're all the same inside
(Same inside)
From 1 to 99


This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are


If money grew on hackberry trees
If time wasn't such a luxury
If love was lovesick over me
That'd be alright
If I could keep the wind in my sails
Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail
A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail
That'd be alright


Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
If everybody, everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
We'd be living us a pretty good life
And that'd be alright


Hey, go heavy on the good and light on the bad
A hair more happy and a shade less sad
Turn all that negative down just a tad
That'd be alright
If my dear old dog never got old
If my family farm never got sold
If another bad joke never got told
That'd be alright


Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
If everybody, everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
We'd be living us a pretty good life
And that'd be alright


Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
That'd be alright

Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark?
Ahh...
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why
When we get crazy
It just ain't to right
(try to keep you head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight
(don't get caught in your little world)
'Cause I love you
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
No, no, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why


Things have changed in the modern world
It Makes it kinda crazy for a boy and girl
All a lot of noise on the radio
It really don't rock
It really don't roll
Well, a kid come along make the young girls swoon
They all put his picture in their pink bedrooms
They all hail the brand new king
Everybody's waiting for the next big thing


Big cigars, diamond rings
Ridin' all around in a limousine
When you finally hit the top
Man you know what that means
Everybody's ready for the next big thing


For a little while
You can do no wrong
Live it up son
Cause it don't last long
There's always somebody
Waitin' in the wings
Thinking they're going to be the next big thing




I'll get a cowboy hat
Some real tight jeans
Lose a little weight and
Get a bellybutton ring
You can stand back I'm a lean machine
Maybe I'm gonna be the next big thing




Everybody's ready for the next big thing


We got winners, we got losers
Chain smokers and boozers
And we got yuppies, we got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar


We got cowboys, we got truckers
Broken-hearted fools and suckers
And we got hustlers, we got fighters
Early birds and all-nighters
And the veterans talk about their battle scars

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar


I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just walkin' through the front door
Puts a big smile on my face
It ain't too far, come as you are
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar


I've seen short skirts, we got high-techs
Blue-collar boys and rednecks
And we got lovers, lots of lookers
And I've even seen dancing girls and hookers
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Yes I do


I like my truck (I like my truck)
I like my girlfriend (I like my girlfriend)
I like to take her out to dinner
I like a movie now and then

But I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just trollin' around the dance floor
Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge, come as you are
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

We got divorcees and a big bouncer man
An old jukebox and a real bad band
We got waitresses and we got barflies
A dumb-ass and a wise-guy
If you get too drunk just sleep out in your car
Reason number 672 why
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Play it on out boys
Beer-thirty's over
Got to take it on home
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
I just love it


Sunday morning man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65


Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours


Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason


That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours


Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out


Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours


My old man's that old man
Spent his life living off the land
Dirty hands and a clean soul
Breaks his heart seeing foreign cars
Filled with fuel that isn't ours
And wearing cotton we didn't grow


He’s got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America


His wife, she's that wife that decorates on the 4th of July
But says "every day's Independence Day"
She’s golden rule, teaches school
Some folks say it isn't cool, but she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway


Got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America


Born in the heartland, raised up a family
Of King James and Uncle Sam


Got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America


Made in America
Made in America

My old man's that old man
He’s made in America

America!

Sometimes, Lord, it feels like
The cards'll never fall my way
And it seems like I spend a lot of time
Just waitin' for my luck to change
But I can see the end in the distance up ahead
An' though I'm not there yet, I keep on going
'Cause I made up my mind, somehow I will survive:
One a step at a time

I know I'm gonna find a place
To rest this weary soul
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind
An' get off this lonesome road

So I'll be walkin' with tunnel vision
To keep my mind off lookin' back
'Cause fallin' for the wrong one
Is what led me down this path
But my day is comin' soon, mountains are in my rear view
Already made it through the hardest part
Nothin's gonna slow me down till I reach that sacred ground
Won't be too long now

I know I'm gonna find a place
To rest this weary soul
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind
An' get off this lonesome road

Instrumental break

Someday I'll lay down those memories
Feel, the sun on my face and the freedom under my feet

I know I'm gonna find a place
To rest this weary soul
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind
An' get off this lonesome road
Get off this lonesome road

You know Dasher, and Dancer, and Prancer, and Vixen
Comet, and Cupid, and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history"

Tell 'em all I'm on vacation
Say I went to visit friends
That you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while
When they ask you where I've been
Tell 'em I'm out on the West Coast
Where it don't ever rain
And that I'm probably doing fine


Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth


Tell 'em all I'm out in Vegas
Blowing every dollar I ever made
Tell 'em that I must be into something bad for me
'Cause I sure lost a lot of weight
Tell 'em I'm out on the road
With some old rock and roll band
Living like a gypsy can


Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth


The truth is that I'm asking you to lie
And we both know that it ain't right
But if you ever loved me
Please have some mercy on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth
I still need you


Yeah, that's the truth
I still love you
Baby, that's the truth


I'm waiting on the sun to set cause yesterday ain't over yet
I started smoking cigarettes there's nothing else to do I guess
Dusty roads ain't made for walking, spinning tires ain't made for stopping
I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me


I gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad
Life ain't hard but it's too long to live it like some country song
Trade the truth in for a lie, cheating really ain't a crime
I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me


Forget your high society, I'm soaking it in kerosene
Light 'em up and watch them burn, teach them what they need to learn; ha!
Dirty hands ain't made for shaking, ain't a rule that ain't worth breaking
Well I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me


Now I don't hate the one who left
You can't hate someone who's dead
He's out there holding on to someone, I'm holding up my smoking gun
I'll find somewhere to lay my blame the day she changes her last name
Well I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me
Well I'm giving up on love hey love's given up on me

Black Pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust
Like a pickup truck does in the mud
But ain’t nobody slowing us down right now

She said, "I need a little something with some get up and go
And nobody knows how to get me going quite like you do
When you do the things you do
Wanna give this sleepy podunk town something to talk about"

We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end so we went

Looking for a dive just to kill some time
Let the heat cool off we could do us some dancing
Didn’t take long, just a couple of songs
You know it’s last call when the law comes walking in

So we were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end so we went

Rocking to the radio, fogging up the windows
Headlights off in a spot nobody else knows

We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end

Black Pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust
Like a pick up truck does in the mud
But ain’t nobody slowing us down right now

(Jerry Laseter/Roger Murrah)

I can hear you smilin' on the 'phone
Bet you thought that I'd be cryin'
Go on, tell yourself I done you wrong
But we both know you'd be lyin'
We don't have to have a reason
If your heart is set on leavin'

To remember on some rainy day
A little simple word or thought
Or a birthday card I bought
Just surrender, 'cause you can't get away
You never can be free
From a memory like I'm gonna be

That greener grass you think you see:
Hah, is just a high-heeled illusion
Better count the cost of bein' free
Is it worth all that you're losin'?
It may be over, but it's not ending
'Cause there's one thing you're forgetting

An' you'll remember on some rainy day
The little things we used to do

Like that night in Baton Rouge
Just surrender, 'cause you can't get away
You never can be free
From a memory like I'm gonna be

When it all comes back someday
You'll be surprised on some lonely night
When you close your eyes

Just surrender, 'cause you can't get away
You never can be free
From a memory like I'm gonna be

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(From a memory.)

Just surrender, 'cause you can't get away
You never can be free
From a memory like I'm gonna be


I still feel 25 most of the time
I still raise a little Cain with the boys
Honky Tonks and pretty women
But Lord I'm still right there with'em
Singing above the crowd and the noise


Sometimes I feel like Jesse James
Still trying to make a name
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am
I was a young troubador
When I wrote in on a song
And I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone


Well the truth about a mirror
Is that a damn old mirror
Don't really tell the whole truth
It don't show what's deep inside
Or read between the lines
And it's really no reflection of my youth




I was a young troubador
When I wrote in on a song
And I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone
I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone

It was me and her all summer long and I learned early on
That there was nothin' hotter than Jenny Jones in July
Parked down by the river's edge with a 6-string in my truck bed
I pull it out as the sun set in the pines

I tell ya, learnin' Brown-Eyed Girl
Was the best thing I ever did before I hit the last chord
She was beggin' for more sayin'
Sing that song again, so I sang that song again

Sha-la-la, we sang it out like we wrote it
And drove that ol' Ford like we stole it, oh, oh
Livin' loud and proud, a little attitude
Thinkin' about her now, what I wouldn't do

Sing that song again
Sing that song again

Bobby Ray had a Mustang after school when the bell rang
We'd all pile in that ol' thing and fly
It was Skoal cans and ballcaps, chasin' girls and skippin' class
And the radio was the soundtrack to our lives

We'd sing "Glory Days" with Springsteen
And as soon as it would end, we'd hit rewind
Every time just to sing that song again
Never thought those days would end

Sha-la-la, we sang it out like we wrote it
And drove that ol' Ford like we stole it, oh, oh
Livin' loud and proud, a little attitude
Thinkin' about it now, what I wouldn't do, sing that song again

We sang it out like we wrote it
Drove that ol' Ford like we stole it, oh, oh
Livin' loud and proud, a little attitude
Thinkin' 'bout it now, what I wouldn't do, sing that song again

Sing that song again, oh, oh
Sing that song again, oh, oh


It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk


It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk


Yeah it's, "Yessir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now"
Fighting words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all


It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk


Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know


It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk

You think your hurt'in
Dont make me laugh
It's a achin'
Make a mole hill out of that
You ain't got no problems
Your just a little depressed

Fractured bones
Skins and scrapes
They heal over
They go away
Your gonna feel it
When you got as bad as it gets
Untill your hearts been broken
You ain't hurt nothing yet

You've got a fever
Of 102
Self-diagnosis
A bad case of the blues
Hurtin' for money
And down to buyin food with the rent

Someone said something
That wasn't nice
They hurt your feelings
So go ahead and cry
It dont amount to nothing
It's something you forgive and forget
Untill your hearts been broken
You ain't hurt nothin' yet

You will recover
You ain't lost it all
Your baby's still lovin you
She's still answers everytime you call
You can imagine what im goin through
And i hope you never do

You will recover
You ain't lost it all
Your baby's still lovin you
She's still answers everytime you call
You can imagine what i'm goin through

Fractured bones
Skins and scrapes
Well they heal over
They go away
Your gonna feel it
When you got as bad as it gets
Untill your hearts been broken
You ain't hurt nothin' yet

Untill your hearts been broken
You ain't hurt nothin'
Ain't hurt nothin' yet

Stumbled across an old green box in my granddaddy's house
Inside was a cross, some old dog tags, and a picture of when he was shipping out
So I showed it to him, said "tell me about those days"
When he looked inside, he closed his eyes all he could say was:

"I hear bagpipes cryin' Amazing Grace, Omaha Beach and her crashing waves
Old Glory draped like Heaven's mercy over the fallen sons
I see all the heroes who were willing to fight in the name of freedom layin' down their lives
And prayin' God's grace would keep us safe from harm, until they brought us boys back home."

Those words to a boy that became a man now I'm ankle deep in this Persian sand
And every day I'm giving all I can because I'm damn proud to be American
Yeah, I made some friends, and I've lost some too
When I think about what they gave for me and you

I hear bagpipes cryin' Amazing Grace, tears rolling down a mother's face
Old Glory draped like Heaven's mercy over the fallen sons
I see all the heroes who are willing to fight in the name of freedom layin' down their lives
And prayin' God's grace would keep us safe from harm, until they bring us boys back home

I hear bagpipes cryin' Amazing Grace, tears rolling down a mother's face
Old Glory draped like Heaven's mercy over the fallen sons
I see all the heroes who are willing to fight in the name of freedom layin' down their lives
And prayin' God's grace would keep you safe from harm, until they bring you boys back home

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away

Here were are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Here were are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough


I was there in the winter of '64
When we camped in the ice at Nashville's doors
Three hundred miles our trail had lead
We barely had time to bury our dead
When the Yankees charged and the colors fell
Overton hill was a living hell
When we called retreat it was almost dark
I died with a grapeshot in my heart


Say a prayer for peace
For every fallen son
Set my spirit free
Let me lay down my gun
Sweet mother Mary I'm so tired
But I can't come home until the last shot's fired


In June of 1944
I waded in the blood of Omaha's shores
Twenty-one and scared to death
My heart pounding in my chest
I almost made the first seawall
When my friends turned and saw me fall
I still smell the smoke, I can taste the mud
As I lay there dying from a loss of blood


Say a prayer for peace
For every fallen son
Set my spirit free
Let me lay down my gun
Sweet mother Mary I'm so tired
But I can't come home until the last shot's fired


I'm in the fields of Vietnam
The mountains of Afghanistan
And I'm still hoping, waiting, praying
I did not die in vain


Say a prayer for peace
For every fallen son
Set my spirit free
Let me lay down my gun
Sweet mother Mary I'm so tired
But I can't come home until the last shot's fired


Say a prayer for peace (for peace)
For our daughters and our sons
Set our spirits free (set us free)
Let us lay down our guns


Sweet mother Mary, we're so tired
But we can't come home (No we can't come home)
Until the last shot's fired


Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more rows and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Give me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house


Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm takin' you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots


Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch


Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots


A little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy


Got a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots


You're the kind of boy who likes the kind of girls
That like to fool around with the boys on the first date
I'm the kind of girl who ain't supposed to like those boys
But I kind of like those boys who like those kind of girls
Well, maybe it's fate, we should meet up for a date


So we can sit around and talk about
Those things we just can't talk about
Like making love and drinking 'til the sun comes up


Well, hallelujah, I finally found a boy like me
Lord have mercy, I think I'm in a fantasy
You've been talking lots of stuff
Saying what you gonna do and what do you wanna do with me?
Well, hallelujah, I finally found a boy like me


You're the kind of boy my daddy used to warn
Would walk into my life and lead me down the wrong way
I'm the kind of girl who tried hard to ignore
Those things that daddy warned about those kind of boys
Well, what's a girl to do with a big ol' boy like you?


When we can sit around and talk about
Those things we just can't talk about
Like making love and drinking 'til the sun comes up


Well, hallelujah, I finally found a boy like me
Lord have mercy, I think I'm in a fantasy
You've been talking lots of stuff
Saying what you gonna do and what do you wanna do with me?
Well, hallelujah, I finally found a boy like me

[Pre-Chorus
We'll sit around and talk about
Those things we just can't talk about
Like making love and drinking 'til the sun comes up


Well, hallelujah, I finally found a boy like me
Lord have mercy, I think I'm in a fantasy
You've been talking lots of stuff
Saying what you gonna do and what do you wanna do with me?
Well, hallelujah
Lord have mercy
Hallelujah, I finally found a boy like me
Yeah yeah, like me


I'd lose my way and I'd lose my mind
If I faced one day on my own
I know I was saved
The night that she gave this drifter's heart a home


Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say near enough
Thank God for this woman, Amen


This world has a way of shaking your faith
I've been broken again and again
But I need all the cracks in my shattered heart
Cause that's where her love gets in


Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say near enough
Thank God for this woman, Amen

She gives me faith
She gives me grace
She gives me hope
She gives me strength
She gives me love
Love without end
Thank God for this woman, Amen


Thanks for the moon and the stars up above
Forgiveness' a sin in your undying love
Every twist every turn for the way you made sure
All my roads led to home


So tonight I will fall down on my knees
Cause Lord knows how lucky I am
I'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs
Thank God for this woman, Amen
And thank God for this woman, Amen

She gives me faith
She gives me grace
She gives me hope
She gives me strength
She gives me love
Love without end
Thank God for this woman, Amen


First one came at 10:35-
Hey, what you doing?'
11:15- "Are you alright, did you finally get moved in?"
12:18- "I miss you"
12:36- "Wish I could kiss you one more time, lay on your shoulder" 1:09- "Can I come over?"


Somebody's been drinkin' and got to thinkin' 'bout us
It's just the cherry bombs talkin' when you're hittin' me up
I got a fire in the backyard, half of bottle of Goose
And a spot on my shoulder so baby come on over
Somebody else has been drinkin' too


1:14 you say you closed your tab
But you need my new address
You shoot me a picture from the back of the cab
Damn, I've never seen that dress
1:26 screenshot, GPS, comin' in hot, two miles away
"I miss you so much," 1:28- "Why'd we ever break up?"


Somebody's been drinkin' and got to thinkin' 'bout us
It's just the cherry bombs talkin' when you're hittin' me up
I got a fire in the backyard, half of bottle of Goose
And a spot on my shoulder so baby come on over
Somebody else has been drinkin' too, yeah


If we cross that line tonight, girl it ain't nobody's fault
And in the mornin' light we can blame it on the alcohol


Somebody's been drinkin' and got to thinkin' 'bout us
It's just the cherry bombs talkin' when you're hittin' me up
I got a fire in the backyard, half of bottle of Goose
And a spot on my shoulder so baby come on over
Somebody else has been drinkin' too


Somebody's been drinkin', yeah

How can we know how far the long way can be
Looking from where we are it never seemed that long to me
I've many miles behind me, maybe not so much ahead
It seems I made good time with the directions I misread

So I'm gonna spend my time like it's going out of style
I'm moving the bottom line farther than a country mile
I still have hills to climb before I hit that wall
No matter how much time I buy I could never spend it all

Funny thing that time, we're always running out
I'm always losing mine, there's not enough of it about
And though it's always here it will always come and go
The days become the years that'll be gone before you know

So I'm gonna spend my time like it's going out of style
I'm moving the bottom line better than a country mile
I still have hills to climb before I hit that wall

I won't go quietly into that dark night
There'll be no more buring daylight
I'll be living in every moment that I'm in

Oh, I'm gonna spend my time like it's going out of style
I'll only use what's mine, I've been saving for awhile
I still have hills to climb before I hit that wall
No matter how much time I buy I could never spend it all

No matter how much time I buy I could never spend it all...

You're the lucky one
So I've been told
As free as the wind
Blowing down the road
Loved by many, hated by none
I'd say you're lucky 'cause I know what you've done
Not a care in the world
Not a worry in sight
Everything's gonna be alright
Cause you're the lucky one


You're the lucky one
Always having fun
A jack of all trades a master none


You look at the world with a smiling eye
And laugh at the devil as his train goes by
Give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
'cause you're the lucky one
Well you're blessed i guess
By never knowing which road your choosing
To you the next best thing
To playing and winning is playing and losing

You're the lucky one
I know that now
Don't ask you why, when, where, or how


You look at the world through your smiling eye
And laugh at the devil as his train goes by
Give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
'cause you're the lucky one
Well you're blessed I guess
By never knowing which road your choosing
To you the next best thing
To playing and winning is playing and losing

You're the lucky one I know that now
Don't ask you why, when, where, or how
No matter where you're at, it's where you'll be
You can bet your luck won't follow me
Just give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
Cause you're the lucky one

Life is taking turns, falling flat on your chin
Trying to fly with the birds
Love sure is blind
‘cause it don’t see
It ain’t spent one night feelin’ sorry for me
There ain’t too many times I felt like a king
Sitting here with your dear makes me wanna sing
Today the sun is shinin’ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain’t sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun, shinin’ on me
Lady love, forgets me every time
I’m spending my days packin’ nickels and dimes
But the man in the moon, yeah he’s alright
He must've flipped on the switch when he left last night
‘cause I’m feeling’ alright, feelin’ alright
Today the sun is shinin’ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain’t sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun, shinin’ on me
There ain’t too many times I felt like a king
Sitting here with you dear makes me wanna sing
Today the sun is shinin’ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain’t sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun is shinin’ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain’t sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun is shinin’ on, shining on, shining on me

I'm putting on pearls, I'm putting on pumps
Gotta little lace apron on me
Gonna make you stop
Gonna make you wanna watch me do the laundry

Gonna put some fun back in this ho-hum honey
Gonna be so hot you think it ought to cost you money
You ain't gonna wanna leave home
'Cause I've got it going on I will be most anything you want

I'll be your laughter, I'll be your drama, I'll be your best friend
I'll be your lover, you can be my baby
Anytime you wanna
But I ain't your mama, no I ain't your mama

I won't make your rules, I won't wipe your nose
I ain't gonna check up on ya
Stay out all night
Long as that sunlight gonna tell on ya

I won't be your boss, I won't be the bad cop baby
But I'll be the one you just wanna love like crazy
'Cause I'll do all those things that make you wanna sing
I'll say your name, make you wanna do the same

I'll be your laughter, I'll be your drama
I'll be your best friend, I'll be your lover
You can be my baby anytime you wanna
But I ain't your mama, no I ain't your mama, oh come on honey

You ain't gonna wanna leave home, 'cause I got it going on

I'll be your laughter, I'll be your drama, I'll be your best friend

I'll be your best friend, I'll be your lover
You can be my baby anytime you wanna
But I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama

Yeah
Won’t do no good, if you run from me
There ain’t no cheatin’, schemin’ my heart don’t see
You left your troubles in my head, in my head
You left your secrets in my bed, in my bed
You’re like the cover of a book that’s been read, baby
I know what line is coming next, coming next

Chorus:
You can’t hide from me
There ain’t no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I don’t know
But my eyes, my eyes, my eyes are like a telescope

You’re kissing her, when my head is turned
You must be crazy baby, haven’t you learned?
You can’t deceive me silly child, silly child
I don’t believe that pretty smile, pretty smile
My intuition can see for miles and miles baby
Every little sin, and everywhere you’ve been

Chorus:
You can’t hide from me
There ain’t no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I don’t know
But my eyes, my eyes, my eyes are like a telescope
Yeah, yeah

You left your troubles in my head, in my head
You left your secrets in my bed

Chorus:
You can’t hide from me
There ain’t no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I don’t know
But my eyes, my eyes, my eyes are like a telescope

You can’t hide from me
There ain’t no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I don’t know
But my eyes, my eyes, my eyes are like a telescope


I'd sell my soul just to see your face
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
In these times I need a saving grace
But time is running out
And I'm starting to lose my faith


But if I told you I loved you
Would it make you want to stay
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you
And making you walk away
I should have took the time to tell you
And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
Girl you gotta know I love you


My heart's on my sleeve but it's turning black
I guess I know what it feels like it to be alone
Without your touch I'm not gonna last
I know you know that I need ya just to carry on
It feels like my walls are caving in
You'd always hold me before I left you hanging on
And I'll do anything to have you here again


But if I told you I loved you
Would it make you want to stay
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you
And making you walk away
I should have took the time to tell you
And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
Girl you gotta know I love you


Yeah, the days are cold
The nights are long
I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want is to tell you I love you
And make you wanna stay
There's gotta be a way
Cause going on without you is killing me everyday


And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
Girl, you gotta know I love you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay


We never spoke a word
But every thought she had, I heard
From across the room
We were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame


Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
I may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away


Wise man next to me did say
About the one that got away
Son, I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance
(Go on son)


You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith


Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away


You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith


Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away


She said, "I need sometime to find myself
I need a little space to think
Maybe we should start seeing other people
Baby, things are moving way to fast for me."
So, I, I picked up what was left of my pride
And I put on my walking shoes
And I got up on that high road
And I did what any gentleman would do..
I, um...


I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'
Man, I think im on to somethin'
Yano I feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend


I love it when she calls me butter cup
Laughs and says I left the toilet seat up
She pops and tosses me a cold beer
And says my buddies always welcome here
When I get hungry, she takes me out
I ride the shotgun like a shitzu hound
My tails a waggin', my tounges hangin' out
It makes me wanna shout...


I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'

There's a man standing on the corner
With a sign saying, 'Will work for food'
You know the man, you see him every morning
The one you never give your money to

You can sit there with your window rolled up
Wondering when the lights going to turn green
Never knowing what a couple more bucks
In his pocket might mean

What if he's an angel sent here from Heaven
And he's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in his face
Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace
What if he's an angel?

There's a man and there's a woman
Living right above you in apartment G
There's a lot of noise coming through the ceiling
And it don't sound like harmony

You can sit there with your TV turned up
While the words and his anger fly
But come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on
Can you look her in the eye?

What if she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
But what if she's an angel?

A little girl on daddy's lap
Hiding her disease with a baseball cap
You can turn the channel, most people do
But what if you were sitting in her daddy's shoes?

Maybe she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
What if she's an angel?

I gas up my truck and I drive into town
But I spend all my time just running around
Trying to shake this negative mood I'm in

I've nowhere to go if I wanna get down
All the usual suspects are hanging around
But after a round or two, it was just a another day again

For a minute or two I'll get you off of my mind
But you keep coming back to me every time


Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on a plane and you ain't coming back?
I said what I said and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth?
Where do I go from you?

I bury myself in my job all day
Just trying to get lost in the usual ways
Smiling and laughing and joking around with the guys

Gotta do something to deaden the pain
So I stare out the window just watching the rain
But all I can see in the haze is the gray of your eyes

So what do I do with all the pieces of you in me?
If you're never coming back, set me free




It was a hundred and seven
We were heading to town
She had her sleeves rolled up
And the windows rolled down
That girl is a cowboy
Robert Earl was singing out
The "Buckin' Song"
With every word that Keen was bringing
She was singing along
That girl is a cowboy


Sometimes the best cowboys aren't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
Because sometimes the best cowboys
Aren't cowboys at all


So I took her tout to show her
How to rope and ride
I can't believe that it was me
That wound up broke and tied
The girls is a cowboy
So that night I decided
We should paint the town
I made it home although
I really don't remember how
That girl is a cowboy


Sometimes the best cowboys aren't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
Because sometimes the best cowboys
Aren't cowboys at all


There's just something that a cowgirl has
Aren't no cowboy's got
Man she's something when she's one of the boys
But something else
Any time she's not


Sometimes the best cowboys aren't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
Because sometimes the best cowboys
Aren't cowboys at all


I can see the tears upon your face, no hiding place
And you're afraid that soon I will be gone, but time will still go on
You're searching for the answers you can find, all in good time


What's the worst thing that can happen
If they say my time is through
Can they take away the love
Or they years I've shared with you
What's the worst thing that can happen
That's the worst that they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, it's all they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, if they want to
Threaten me with Heaven, I believe that it's true
Threaten me with Heaven, I'll be waiting on you


I hear angels through the window pane, calling my name
Someday when they carve my name in stone, I won't be
I won't be alone
If by chance a miracle appears, I'll dry your tears




What's the worst thing that can happen
What's the worst that they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, that's all they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, ooh, I'll be waiting on you
Threaten me with Heaven


I'd love to know just what you're thinkin'
Every little river, runnin' through your mind
You give and you take
You come and you go
You leave me here wonderin' if I'll ever know
How much you care or how much you don't
Whatever you need, whatever you want


If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
If you're gonna be somebody's mistake
If you're gonna be somebody's first time
Somebody's last time, baby be mine
If you're lookin' to be somebody's 'just friends'
A little laughin', little lovin', never callin' again, that's just fine
If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Be mine, yeah
Oh, be mine


I guess that all I'm tryin' to tell ya
Is a minute with you is better than two without
Oh, I won't be a fool but I can't play it cool
So I'm playin' it safe and I'm breakin' the rules
I'm wishin' I had what I know that you got
So if you're comin' my way then please don't stop


If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
If you're gonna be somebody's mistake
If you're gonna be somebody's first time
Somebody's last time, baby be mine
If you're lookin' to be somebody's 'just friends'
A little laughin', little lovin', never callin' again, that's just fine
If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Be mine, yeah
Oh, be mine


If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Or somebody's mistake
Somebody's first time, or their last time
Baby, be mine
If you're lookin' to be somebody's 'just friends'
A little laughin', little lovin', never callin' again, that's just fine
If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Be mine (If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak)
Be mine (If you're gonna be somebody's mistake)
Oh, I'll take my chances
If you're gonna be someone's heartbreak
If you're gonna be someone's mistake
Somebody's first time, somebody's last time
Be mine
Oh, be mine
Be mine
Baby, baby, baby, be mine, all mine
If you're gonna break someone's heart, yeah
Might as well, might as well be mine


I'm so glad that I met you baby
I'm so proud when we walk in the room
I know it's crazy to worry like I do
I get this feeling that I'm losing you


I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's going to steal you away from me


When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room
I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it, but it gets me sometimes


I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's going to steal you away from me


Ooh, suspicions


When I'm with you I feel so satisfied
The way you touch me when you lay by my side
That look in your eyes when we make love
Makes me hate myself for what I'm thinking of


I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's going to steal you away from me


Suspicions
Even though I know that you love me baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's going to steal you away from me
Suspicions
Oh baby Oh darling


'Cause I love her
'Cause I love her


I love her and she loves me
Aren’t nobody going to take my girl from me

What child is this who lay to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthem sweet
While shepherds watch our keeping?

This, this is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him, Lord
The Babe, the Son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant King to own Him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Raise, raise the Son on high
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary

This, this is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him, Lord
The Babe, the Son of Mary

Written by Holly Williams

You could've been bitter, you could've hated him
You could've talked about the whiskey and the women
He couldn've done better, but you loved him anyhow
Then you taught us all the power of forgiveness

Mama, you were smiling when you could've been crying all night
Mama, you made me believe everything was alright
Mama, you never wore your pain too thick
I'd like to thank you for this

You could've fought, you could've cut him down to shame
You could've told us that our daddy didn't want us
But that wasn't true, and you knew it all along
It was a struggle between the road and loving you

Mama, you were smiling when you could've been crying all night
Mama, you made me believe everything was alright
Mama, you never wore your pain too thick
I'd like to thank you for this

You did more good for me than you will ever know
I've seen mothers fill their childrens hearts with hate
But you knew better than to drag me down with you
You let me love my daddy just the same

Mama, you were smiling when you could've been crying all night
Mama, you made me believe everything was alright
Mama, you never wore your pain too thick
I'd like to thank you for this
Oh I'd like to thank you for this


Baby, I've got plans tonight
You don't know nothin' about
I've been sittin' 'round way too long
Tryin' to figure you out
But you say that you'll call and you don't
And I'm spinnin' my wheels
So I'm goin' out tonight in my red high heels


I'm gonna call up that old boyfriend you said
Still has it bad for me
I'm gonna take him into town, flaunt him around
For everyone to see
Well, you said once yourself, baby
Yeah, you know the deal
Nobody holds a candle to me
In my red high heels


Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels


All those games you tried to play
Well, they ain't gonna work on me now
I put a barbed wire fence around my heart, baby
Just to keep you out
Well, you thought I'd wait around forever
But baby, get real
I just kicked you to the curb
In my red high heels


Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels
Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels


In my red high heels
In my red high heels


I rolled my daddy's truck off the Dixonville curve after drinking my fifth beer
And I fed hogs trying to pay him off for most of my senior year
I got my jaw jacked by a big ole boy for messing 'round with his girlfriend
But she was tall and tan and she kissed just right but I'll never do that again


Yeah, I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way


I've been kicked in the face by horse cause I ran up too fast behind him
And I shook hands on a deal with a man, and found out he was lying
I've broken a couple good girls hearts cause I said I loved em knowing I couldn't
An I've given my heart to a woman who said she'd stay, when I knew she wouldn't




I've been bit I've been burned
But I've lived and I've learned from it
I've made some mistakes but that's what it takes to make a man out of a kid





That's how I've got to be this, how I've got to be this
How I've got to be this way...


Well, it's your birthday
Let's act like it is
And just go crazy
Do what we want with no reason why
Life ain't long enough
So let's celebrate
And get drunk on good love
Remember what it's like to just dance all night
We'll dance all night


That's the way that we're doing it, doing it
We go big or we go back home
People looking at us like we're losing it, losing it
But, baby, we ain't doing nothing wrong
Gonna be up all night
Chasing the sunrise
Like we're wild and young
Baby, kids on the run
Gonna party like we just turned 21


Let's treat this town
Like we own it
And baby, if you wanna get out
You can drive this car like you stole it
Like we're runaways, like we're superstars
Like we're fireworks burning in the dark


That's the way that we're doing it, doing it
We go big or we go back home
People looking at us like we're losing it, losing it
But, baby, we ain't doing nothing wrong
Gonna be up all night
Chasing the sunrise
Like we're wild and young
Baby, kids on the run
Gonna party like we just turned 21


Ain't nobody wants to act their age
Ain't no sense in us living this way
You and I, girl, we gotta get away
And make tonight the best night of our lives


That's the way that we're doing it, doing it
We go big or we go back home
People looking at us like we're losing it, losing it
But, baby, we ain't doing nothing wrong
Gonna be up all night
Chasing the sunrise
Like we're wild and young
Baby, kids on the run
Gonna party like we just turned 21
Oh, we just having fun
Yeah


I was standin' with my friend when I saw you walkin' in
And my heart started skippin' a beat
I was tryin' to play it cool, but I knew it was true
That nobody would ever compete


Well first comes love and then comes
First date first kiss, we were checkin' off the list
Then you were gettin' down on your knee
And you didn't have to guess, it was always a yes
Now there's two less fish in the sea


Let's set the date
Let's hire the band
Let's cut the cake
Tie up the cans


I love the ring of your name
You're the ying to my yang
Oh baby let's give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I'm talkin' about tying the knot
Tie it up


Something old, something new
Something borrowed, something blue
And the chairs lined up in the yard
The I do's and the kisses
From a miss to a misses
Can't wait for forever to start


Let's set the date
Let's hire the band
Let's cut the cake
Tie up the cans


I love the ring of your name
You're the ying to my yang
Oh baby let's give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I'm talkin' about tying the knot
Tie it up


Tie it up
Invite the town
Let's raise a glass and lock it down
Tie it up
Forever bound
Cause I'm fit to be tied down


When mama's kickin' off her shoes
And daddy's spinnin' from the booze
And the last song is finally sung
We can run to the room
Kickstart the honeymoon
Don't it sound like a whole lotta fun?


Let's set the date
Let's hire the band
Let's cut the cake
Tie up the cans


Tie it up
Tie it up

The first time
That I ever
Saw your face
I felt something
Stop me in my place
The kinda thing
That you
Just can't see
Coming your way

I closed my eyes
And I jumped right in
Zero to sixty
And to the win
With my head held high
Like it was
Never coming home
And I trusted you
When you asked me to

When I said I would
Tell me
What was I thinking
I gave my heart
Without even blinking
That's all you got?
Well baby
That's just no good
(Whoa)
Don't give me that lie
You know I won't buy it
You're as good at love
As you are at lying
You said "uh-huh"
But I just don't think
You understood
When I said I would

I stood by you
Played by the rules
For a second I thought
That you did too
Makes me wonder
How long you
Would have let me
Be a fool
I gave it my best
This is what I get

When I said I would
Tell me
What was I thinking
I gave my heart
Without even blinking
That's all you got?
Well, baby
That's just no good
(Whoa)
Don't give me that lie
You know I won't buy it
You're as good at love
As you are at lying
You said "uh-huh"
But I just don't think
You understood
When I said I would
Uuuuuhhhhh
When I said I would

I'm taking back
(When I said
I would love you)
I'm taking back
(Every kiss
That I gave you)
I'm taking back
(Every promise
I made you)
I'm taking back
Everything
That I said

When I said I would
Tell me
What was I thinking
I gave my heart
Without even blinking
That's all you got?
Well, baby
That's just no good
(Whoa)
Don't give me that lie
You know I won't buy it
You're as good at love
As you are at lying
You said "Uh-huh"
But I just don't think
You understood
When I said I would
When I said I would

(Whoa)
Don't give me that lie
You know I won't buy it
You're as good at love
As you are at lying
You said "Uh-huh"
But I just don't think
You understood
When I said I would
When I said I would

'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when the blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue Christmas

You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas


I got a picture of him, barefoot in the mud
Behind his grandpa's plow an' two great mules
When he turned ten years old, on May 8, '53
He grew up fearin' God in Washburn, Tennessee
The closest thing he had to a Dad was his Uncle Bob
An' he could only dream of things like little league baseball
An' that little boy, with big blue eyes and calloused hands
Huh, became my old man
Well she was a Kentucky girl, born on Valentine's Day
The fourth child of five to my Grandma, Eula May
So shy and beautiful with sunset hair and emerald eyes
Her Daddy spent his life workin' in the coal mines
Now in my eyes, all my life, my Daddy's been a Saint
But even Saints need Angels to show them the way
And over thirty-seven years ago, he asked for Margaret Lynn's hand
And that Angel married my old man
And there were times I tried to buck, the truthful things they said
But now I'm glad that, more than once, they rattled my stubborn head
Because my folks are just like mountains, I looked at from afar
But now the closer I get to them, the bigger they are
The time seems to fly anymore, and the holidays are so far apart
There's no way a 'phone call could express what's in my heart
So this is just a song to say how greatful I am
For Mamma and my old man
For Mamma and Dad


Hey, little girl with your tangled hair
Your tattered clothes
You're 15
And you're bound to bloom just like a rose
You're wishing that you had designer jeans
Like the ones you see in magazines
I know you'd give anything just to fit in
But you aren't on a price tag, it comes from within


Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Just the way you are


Hey, there little homecoming queen
In that back seat
I bet his brown eyes
Are promising you everything
I know you want to be just like your friend
But he'll still love you if you don't give in
If those girls are being honest that have been where you're at
I bet they'd tell you that they wish they had their innocence back


Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Just the way you are


Still he left you for a girl that could be your twin
If you were twenty-eight again
Let him go (let him go)
Let him fly (let him fly)
Keep your head up get on with your life


Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Just the way you are


I was drivin' to town and I passed by a house
The one with pillars on the porch
Had a sign on the door said "for sale"
So what the hell
I walked in, and sat down on some strangers couch
Solid Oak Hardwood floors
Didn't need to see more
'Cause I could hear you in the kitchen
Playin' your guitar
All our friends coming over
Little lights in the yard


And dammit
Didn't we almost have it?
Honestly, I still don't understand it
We used to love to sit and talk and wish
And picture and planin'
Man, now I just...dammit


I think the owners could tell I was lost in myself
So they left me alone, said "make yourself right at home"
I was already makin' dinner
Callin' you down the stairs
Little girl out the window
Hear her laughin' out there


Dammit
Didn't we almost have it?
Honestly, I still don't understand it
We used to love to sit and talk and wish
And picture and planin'
Man now, I just...dammit
Baby, didn't we almost have it?
Honestly, I still don't understand it
We used to love to sit, talk and wish
And picture and plan it
Man, now I just... dammit


Now I'm driving away
Thinking "oh, what a shame"
You can pray, you can hope
But you just never know
I guess that two bedroom picket fence magic
Can't ever be ours now, can it?
(Dammit)


Ooh
Honestly, I still don't understand it
Thinking how could we, coulda had it
We coulda had it
Dammit

Slept in my makeup
Didn't get my teeth brushed
I crashed on the couch
And now my mouth tastes like yesterday's news
Well hello Jim Beam
Oh the places you've seen
If only you could talk
You'd tell me why he walked out on me and you

Oh the things lovers do when it's over
Oh the things lovers do when it's done
Find a cool bottle or a warm shoulder
Wake up older
And try to move on

I drove around last night
Thinkin' 'bout our last fight
I cruised by your house
And all the lights were out and you were gone
So I found me a stranger
Well theres comfort in danger
But I thought about you
The whole time we were gettin' it on

Oh the things lovers do when it's over
Oh the things lovers do when it's done
Find a cool bottle or a warm shoulder
Wake up older
And try to move on

Find a cool bottle or a warm shoulder
Wake up older
Wake up older

Slept in my makeup
Didn't get my teeth brushed
I crashed on the couch and now my mouth tastes like
Yesterday's news


I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leaves
It hid the braces on his legs at first
His smile was as bright as the August sun
When he looked at me
As he struggled down the driveway
It almost made me hurt
Will don't walk too good
Will don't talk too good
He won't do the things that the other kids do
In our neighborhood


I've been searching, wondering, thinking
Lost and looking all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved, and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been reading, writing, praying, fighting
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will


Will's mom had to work two jobs
We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed
Since I don't know when
"Hey Jude" was his favorite song
At dinner he'd ask to pray
And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him


I've been searching, wondering, thinking
Lost and looking all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved, and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been reading, writing, praying, fighting
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will


Before they moved to California
His mother said, they didn't think he'd live
And she said each day that I have him
Well, it's just another gift
And I never got to tell her
That the boy showed me the truth
In crayon red, on notebook paper, he'd written
Me and God love you


I've been searching, praying, wounded, jaded
I guess I would be still
Yeah that was until
I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leaves


This gettin' up early, pullin' double shifts
Gonna make an old man of me long before I ever get rich
But I'm tryin'
It's been two years since we've finalized
I still ain't used to puttin' ex, in front of wife
But I'm tryin'


Send more money right away is pretty much all she has to say
When she calls these days, and don't you be late


But all I can do, is all I can do
And I keep on tryin'
And all I can be, is all I can be
And I keep on tryin'


But there's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbin' and fallin' and climbin'
But I keep on tryin'


I remember daddy sayin' keep your eye on the ball
Run like hell, play to win, get up when you fall
I'm tryin'
Don't say nothin' that you can't take back
Never do anything you might regret, no don't do that
Daddy, I'm tryin'


Know the difference between heaven and hell
Go easy on the bottle, be hard on yourself
And I know he meant well


But all I can do, is all I can do
And I keep on tryin'
And all I can be, is all I can be
And I keep on tryin'


But there's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbin' and fallin' and climbin'
But I keep on tryin'
I keep on tryin'


But all I can do, is all I can do
And I keep on tryin'
And all I can be, well that's all I can be
And I keep on tryin'
All I can do, is all I can do
But I keep on tryin'


But there's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbin' and stumblin' and then fallin' and then climbin'
But I keep on tryin'


This gettin' up early, pullin' double shifts
Gonna make an old man of me long before I ever get rich
But I'm tryin'


There's a new wind blowing like I've never known
I'm breathing deeper than I've ever done
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you
And I am letting go of all my lonely yesterdays
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made
Now there's just one thing, the only thing I wanna do
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you


Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine
Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do


I used to run in circles going nowhere fast
I'd take, uh, one step forward and two steps back
Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you
Whoa! here we go now!
Hey, I wanna love ya baby


Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine
Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do


Sometimes it's hard for me to understand
But you're teaching me to be a better man
I don't wanna take this life for granted like I used to do, no, no
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you
I'm ready to love somebody
Love somebody like you. Ooh
And I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you, yeah
Oh yeah
Hey, I wanna love ya baby




Oh, I wanna be the man in the middle of the night
Shining like its true
I wanna be the man that you run to whenever I call on you
When everything that loved someone finally found its way
Wanna be a better man
I see it in you yeah
Hey, I wanna be that...

Sittin out here on the hood of this truck looking up
At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checkin my watch doin the math in my head
Counting back words to when you said goodbye
Well those runway lights are gettin brighter

Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you dont love me anymore
Right now im sittin' out here watching airplanes

I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me runnin down the runway just like i was crazy
That fence is too high so am I

So I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
By now I know you're thirty thousand feet above me
But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now I know I outta act like you don't love me

But im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore

Yeah im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Go bye, bye, bye
Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Baby bye, bye, bye

He had a freezer full of bomb pops
Push ups, drum sticks and dreamcicles
And a paint chipped change box
Full of sticky quarters, dimes and nickles
It was automatic when you heard that song
Run home and get your money before he's gone

Lookin' underneath the Chrysler in the driveway
Hey, dad what ya doin'
The smell of summer twilight
There's always somebody barbeque'n
Truth or dare with the kids on our road
Hide and seek till your mama calls you home

Chorus

Sweet summer, yeah I remember that
Sweet summer, let me take you back

Both our moms were best friends
And she was the youngest of three daughters
An angel on a pink Schwinn, my first crush
To this day I ain't forgot her
Those days were never too long
And never too hot
Even though I was out of school
I was learnin' a lot

Chorus

Bridge

There's not a day that I don't remember
From the end of May to the first of September

Chorus


The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh cause I kind of like feeling this way


I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love


It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day


I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love


Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song


I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love


(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love, (woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love (woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love (woke up still drunk on your love)
(woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love, on your love (woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love, get drunk on your love, yeah
I'm so drunk


Take me out to the ball game


Swing batter, batter, swing (x6)


(Strike one)
Hey baby, do you do come here often
(Strike two)
Hey baby, now what's your sign
(Strike three)
Hold on, now where are you going?
(He is out)
Jimmy's out next in line




(First Base)
Why yes I went to Harvard
(Safe!)
I majored in Pre-Med
(He's got a big lead)
(Picked off)
Just stayed for one semester
(It could be he's out)
Toms out who's next



[Verse 3
Everybody strikes out nine times out of ten
But you got to step up to the plate son because every now and then
(Fast ball)
She walked right up to me
(Here's the pitch)
Said could I take you home
(Theirs a drive)
Hey boys I'll see you later
(It could be, it, it is!)
Going, going, going, gone



It took a while for me to see things as they were
In the light of truth
It wasn't you,it was me
I let myself get used to drowning in the hurt
Against the wall
Who'd of thought,it was me
From there I couldn't even look over my shoulder
I kicked down all the walls and started all over

And I don't paint myself into corners anymore
In a brittle heart of clay
I threw my brushes away
The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me
Are out the door
I don't paint myself into corners anymore

When you left you left me with no other choice at all
But to sink
To my knees,and cry
I never knew just how far a soul could fall
Like a rock
I couldn't stop,didn't try
I locked myself behind shades of misery
But when I let you go,I set myself free

And I don't paint myself into corners anymore
In a brittle heart of clay
I threw my brushes away
The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me
Are out the door
I don't paint myself into corners anymore

The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me
Are out the door
I don't paint myself into corners anymore

To me twelve months is a long, long time
For someone to suddenly change their mind
He was in and out, now it's just too late
But I won't lose one night of sleep
Worryin' about what was meant to be
His leavin' is just a reason to celebrate

Chorus

I'm on a mission, I got a cause
I'm gonna hit every rockin' little honky-tonk bar
And the way I'm thinkin', it ought to be against the law
Gonna see what kind of trouble I can find
I'm on a head-on collision with a real good time
I'm on a mission, and it's all about forgettin' tonight

Forty-hour week and I'm out the door'Seems like all I'm workin' for
Is that time when I can finally just cut loose
I got a few good friends and they're waitin' to go
Just gimme some time to change my clothes
'Til Monday mornin', there ain't nothin' I gotta do

(Chorus)
Ain't worried 'bout a five-day no-sleep business-week
No-escape workin'-girl blues
Yeah, I'm just doin' what any other
Modern day American woman might do

(Chorus)
I'm on a mission and it's all about forgettin' tonight
I'm on a mission

Out of all of the places in this little town
Yeah, you had to come walking in here and sit down
I'm hiding and hoping my face ain't too red
Since we been over, been trying like crazy to get you out of my head


So why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good
Don't know what you were thinkin', you were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you


I wish you had on sunglasses to cover up those blue eyes
I wish you said something mean to make me glad that you said goodbye
Why can't you look off somewhere if you catch me staring at you
Why can't you be cold like any old good ex would do




Why, why, why
Would you tell me that you call me up sometime?
Maybe we can get a drink and just catch up
Like that'd be enough
No, that ain't enough




Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Out of all of the places
In this little town
Yeah, you had to come walking in here and sit down


She said, "I've seen you in here before."
I said, "I've been here a time or two."
She said, "Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face"
I said, "Girls,"


I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was


I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
"Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?"
I said, "Dave,"


I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was


I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, "You can't do this boy"
But my pride says, "Oh, yes you can"


I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

She was standin' by the bar
At the club we were playin'
Half an hour before the show
I couldn't stop starin'
So finally I decided to say hello
She'd never seen the band but she was a fan
She'd heard a couple of songs online
We sat there talking 'til the club filled up
And it was show time
I said, "I didn't catch your name"
She said, "Amy"
I said, "Will I see you after the show?"
She said, "Maybe"
And all night I tried
To look out at that crowd and find her
But those lights were so damn bright
Up there
So I said
"We've got time for one more song
You all know it so sing along
Gonna sing it out to a girl
I hope she's still here"
And I sang
"Amy, what you wanna do?
I think that I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do, yeah, yeah
With a girl like her
The best you can hope to do is date her off and on
You think it's going great
You turn around one day and she'll be gone
And she's beautiful and sweet
And complicated
She'll break my heart
And then she'll show up where I'm playing
So all night I tried
To look out at that crowd and find her
But those lights were so damn bright
Up there
So I said
"We've got time for one more song
You all know it so sing along
Gonna sing it out to a girl, I hope she's still"
And I sing
"Amy, what you wanna do?
I think that I could stay with you
Oh, for a while, maybe longer if I do" Yeah, yeah
Oh, I keep falling in and out of love with you
Falling in and out of love with you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
'Cause I keep falling in and out of love with you
Yeah, yeah


Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh


Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making sprits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight


Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh. Hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh


You know I hate the cold
That's why I always go
Down south to drink some rum
On a island in the sun
There's nothing like St. Croix
With the palm trees swaying slow
Or being there on an open dock
When the New Year comes and goes


Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh


I don't want to spend another lonely night
Ooooooo


I've got the lights turned up
The door is locked
The bedroom TV's on
Doing the only thing
That gets me through the night
Since you've been gone


Prayin' for daylight waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight


I made a bad miscalculation
Betting you would never leave
Cause if you're getting on with your new life
Then where does that leave me




Hoping that I didn't wait too long
That this is just the dark before the dawn


Deep in my heart I know
That you love me as much as I love you
And that you must be lying somehwere
Looking up to heaven too




Prayin' for daylight
I don't want to spend another lonely night
I don't want to spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight

On a three-hour flight from Memphis to LA
I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade
Laughing at my jeans and my boots beside those high-dollar shoes and Armani suits
When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you'd like the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business, in New York and Rome
Tell me son, where do you call home?

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames and
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from

So we drank that round and then another
There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover
He said I headed out west when I was barely 19
Just a kid chasing my dreams
And I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother
He's been fighting the cancer they discovered
But he called last night and said I think this is the end
So come take me home to my family and my friends

Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen
The trucks a Ford and the tractor's green
And "Amazing Grace" is what we sing
Where there's a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call
It may not sound like much but it's where I'm from

And as we stood to claim the bags we checked
He said I'll pray for your brother and did I mention that
Italian suits haven't always been my style
See I was the quarterback of my high school team
We took state back in '63 and my wife well she is still my homecoming queen

Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
I said it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from
Amazing Grace
It's where I'm from
How sweet the sound
It's where I'm from
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, amazing grace


I woke up, poundin’ head
With a bottle, layin’ in the bed
There was a little, a little bit left
So I picked it up, and I killed the rest


Oh I know I’m going to heaven
But I can’t go with me like this
I need to pull myself together before then
No, and I ain’t afraid of dyin’
But what scares me to death
Is meetin’ Jesus with whiskey on my breath


I lost her and all my friends
Broke all but one of my Lord’s ten
But Jesus died for all my sins
That’s how I know I’m gettin’ in

 x2


I wanted lace, I wanted pearls, to be a princess like
The other girls
But life came hard, to my front door
And I grew up trying
To even out the score
Tough, I ain't never been nothing but tough, all my edges have
Always been rough


But Jesus loves me anyway
Oh backbone, there ain't nothing wrong with a woman that
Got a little backbone


You just wait 'til you taste her kind of love
You want a shy little thing, a pretty little high heel thing
Going to cry if I don't polish up
Tough


The way I see it, the hand of fate, did me a favor, with
The cards he dealt my way
Found out real fast, life is a game
You're out real quick if you don't know how to play, tough
I ain't never been nothing but tough
All my edges have always been rough


But Jesus loves me anyway
Oh backbone, there ain't nothing wrong with a woman that
Got a little backbone


You just wait 'til you taste her kind of love
You want a shy little thing, a pretty little high heel thing
Going to cry if I don't polish up


Are you serious? You ain't fooled me much
You just a hanging round
So you can try your luck
Well tough, I ain't never been nothing but tough
All my edges has always been rough
You want a shy little thing, a pretty little high heel thing
Going to cry if I don't polish up
You know what I got to say about that is tough

Found an old box in the bottom of the closet
'Neath a bowling ball bag full of magazines
Had a school sweater with a ring in the pocket
From my first cigar - man did I turn green
Hey honey come look at what I just found
This old picture of us when the carnival came to town

I was superman, tarzan
Thought I was a star in a rock n roll band
You were Lois Lane, Lady Jane
I wasn't very good
But you were the biggest fan of the man
That your momma warned you not to trust
Now Baby look at us

There's a bracelet I made you at your homecoming party
Bought a six-pack of Bud just to get tabs
Took you home and you wore it proudly
But i got in big trouble when you showed your dad
Here's a speaker from the Dickson Drive-In show
What movie was playing we never did know

I was Superman, Tarzan
Thought I was a star in a rock n roll band
You were Lois Lane, Lady Jane
I wasn't very good
But you were the biggest fan of the man
That your momma warned you not to trust
And baby look at us

You were the biggest fan of the man
That your momma warned you not to trust
And baby look at us

I was Superman, Tarzan
You were Lois Lane, Lady Jane
Yeah and baby look at us
Look at us...


I paint my lips red, I turn my own head
Don't need nobody's help, zipping up my own dress
Pay my own tab, with my own cash, unattached
Sometimes the word alone, sounds like a sad song
But why's it gotta be, cause what I really need is a reset
And a deep breath, yeah


I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a california king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break


It's just a little phase, give me a little space
You might see through it, but I'm putting on a poker face
Givin' love a rest, between my ex, and my next


I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break


Love, I'm over you (love, I'm over you)
It's long overdue
I think it's time to take a heart break (I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound)
I think it's time to take a heart break


I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a california king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

VERSE
Baby lay back
Dream out loud
Tell me the things you wish for
And think about

You ain't gonna scare me
No, I ain't gonna run
Come on and whisper you fantasies to me
One by one

They may not be
As crazy as you think

CHORUS
The sun in the morning
Kissing your skin
A blanket at night
That you're wrapped up in

Your lover
That one best friend
I'll be that
I'll be that

The one that will
Stand and fight for you
A safe place you can run to
The truth in the words "I do"

I'll be that to you

VERSE
I'll spend forever
Here in your arms
Learning your body language
Til I know it by heart

And I'll be beside you
Whatever you face
You see, diamonds are made
Between a rock and a hard place

If you let me
Baby I can be

CHORUS

The sky's not the limit
Cause there's footprints on the moon
Just think how far
My love would go for you

Ooooh baby
Awwww baby

CHORUS

I'll be that to you
Lay back baby
The sun in the morning
Kissin' your skin
The blanket your wrapped up in
I'll be that


This is a song
About best friends


John Roy was a boy I knew
Since he was three and I was two
Grew up two little houses down from me

The only two bad apples
On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny

Well now I was smart
But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixing
Fire and gasoline
(And he'd say)


Hey Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hanging
From the mirror for luck
Said don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world


Long around
Our eighteenth year
We found two plane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town
School in Texas

Learned to drink Sangria
Till the dawns early light
Eat eggs Ranchero
And throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls
We were majoring in a rodeo

Ah but my
Favorite memory
At school that fall
Was the night John Roy
Came running down the hall
Wearing nothing
But cowboy boots
And a big sombrero
(And he was yelling)




And I said
We had a little
Change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney
Got busted in Japan
And I said
We got waylaid
When we laid foot
On Mexican soil
See the border guard
With the Fu Manchu mustache
Kind of stumbled on John's
Pocket full of American cash
He said
Dion a little funny business
In Mexico Amigo

But all I could think about
Was saving my own tail
When he mentioned ten years
In a Mexican jail
So I pointed to John Roy and said
It's all his now please let me go
Well it was your idea genius
I was just laying there in bed
When you said




Ah we're still best friends
Temporary cell mates

If a melody is like a memory
You're a long hot summer night symphony
Blaring on the speakers of my Monte Carlo
Down FM 109 on my FM Radio

We could take it slow
Put it on cruise control
You know it's been a while

We're never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going outta style singing

Singing "Rebel Rebel" at the top of our lungs
Out of town windows down playing those dashboard drums
Everybody said you'd never make it too far
With some poor boy playing on some pawn shop guitar

You know my crazy dreams
Were busting at the seams
Just like these old boots and jeans

We're never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going, never going outta style
We're never going outta style

I'll pop my collar do my best James Dean
We'll hit the road like a Steve McQueen movie scene
Show me your million dollar Marilyn smile
And I'll show you a love love love

That's never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going outta style

We could take it slow
Put it on cruise control
The way we love is never going outta style

Never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
We're never going outta style
In my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
Never going outta style
We're never going outta style
Yeah, we're never going outta style


You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe

Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you


We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down


If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party


Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room


Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down


If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party


So I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, baby, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you


We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down


If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party


Seven Thirty-five
She's someone else’s wife
I can get on with my life
And that thrills me
She married him today
Her daddy gave the bride away
I heard a tear roll down her face
And that kills me


Cause now I
Can see why
She's finally crying


How was I supposed to know?
She was slowly letting go?
If I was putting her through her hell
Hell I couldn't tell


She could've given me a sign
Could've opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see?
She never cried in front of me


Yea maybe I might’ve changed
It's hard for me to say
But the story's still the same
It's a sad one
And I'll always believe
If she ever did cry for me
They were tears that you can't see
You know the bad ones


And now I
Can see why
She's finally crying






Without a doubt
I know now
How it outta be
Now she's gone
And it's wrong
And it bothers me
Tomorrow I'll still be
Asking myself




She could've given me a sign
Could've opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see?

How was I supposed to see?
She never cried in front of me


Hell I couldn't tell


I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?
I don't need baggy clothes
Or rings in my nose to be cool
The scars on my knuckles
Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots
An' there's a whole lot more like me:
How 'bout you?
I punch the clock trying' to make it to the top:
How 'bout you?
I aren’t got no blue-blood trust fund
I can dip in to
Yeah, I wish Uncle Sam would give a damn
About the man who's collar's blue
But if he don't, hell, I'll make it on my own:
How 'bout you?


An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?


I still say: "Yes, Ma'am" to my Momma:
How 'bout you?
If I shake your hand, look you in the eye
You can bet your ass, it'll be the truth
I cover my heart with my hat
When they fly that Red, White and Blue
Just like my Daddy taught me:
How 'bout you?


An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?


I like my country rocking'
How 'bout you?
Just put me on a stage, man
Turn it up an' I'll turn it loose
Yeah, give me a crowd that's redneck an' loud
We'll raise the roof
Hell, I might just stay all night long
How 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
Cause, man, I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?


Damn, pretty girl you went and done it again
You've gone and turned your sexy all the way up to 10
I've never seen a side ride seat looking so hot
Baby, you rock, hit the spot like a fireball shot
You've got me all high, head spinning around and around
I'm down if you're down to burn down this town


Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Just slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we've got all night
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Ready, set, let's roll


Where the good years and good times meet
Girl, we can rev it up right 'til we overheat
Just forget about the time, get your lips on mine
Gotta kiss you, get to know your smile
On your mark, get set


Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Just slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we've got all night
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride


You got my heart bump-bumping
When I'm pulling up into your drive
Let's hit it 90 to nothin'
Couple kids running into the night


Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Just slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we've got all night
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up on inside


Yeah we can run this town
You know I'll rock your world, c'mon
Let's roll, let's ride, let's run this town tonight
Read, set, let's roll


There were thirteen kids in line at the mall today just to meet Santa
And one little boy jumped up and yelled, "I gotta question to ask ya
Santa, are you rockin' the beer gut like my daddy is?"
And without a pause, he said, "Let me tell you something young man, about Santa Claus"
This belly ain't from drinking beer, there's a lot of love inside of here
So I guess that you could say


I'm rockin' the cheer gut
'Cause I love the way your cookies taste
Rockin' the cheer gut
There's a shot of milk with every bite I take
Rockin' the cheer gut
I'm the jolly man full of love and joy
I've rolled around the world before all the kids wake up
Rockin' the cheer gut


Now Mrs. Claus goes on and on about me and my weight and how I should be lookin'
I'm not really sure what I can do with all of her home-cookin'
She says she worries all night long I'm gonna end up stuck in a chimney
When I put away the sled this year, I've got a date with PX90
I know my belly gets a little wide every year around Christmas time
So I guess that you could say


I'm rockin' the cheer gut
'Cause I love the way your cookies taste
Rockin' the cheer gut
There's a shot of milk with every bite I take
Rockin' the cheer gut
I'm the jolly man full of love and joy
I've rolled around the world before all the kids wake up
Rockin' the cheer gut


Go Santa go Santa go Santa go Santa go Santa
Go Santa go Santa go Santa go Santa go Santa

This belly ain't from drinking beer, there's a lot of love inside of here
So I guess that you could say

I'm rockin' the cheer gut
'Cause I love the way your cookies taste
Rockin' the cheer gut
There's a shot of milk with every bite I take
Rockin' the cheer gut
I'm the jolly man full of love and joy
I've rolled around the world before all the kids wake up
Rockin' the cheer gut

Go Santa go Santa go Santa go Santa go Santa
Go Santa go Santa go Santa go Santa go Santa

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey
And some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer
Really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you


Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be


I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without


Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me


He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...


Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...


So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...


He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

You taught me how to whistle
And how to tie my shoes
And how to talk to Jesus
In the darkness of my room

You held my hand when I got stitches
When one of Tommy Tyler's pitches hit my face
One time I stole from your purse
Then I lied and made it worse but you loved me anyway

Growing up, I remember your amazing grace
I still feel your arms around me now and then
I miss you wavin' from the front door, I can't drive by there anymore
'Cause no one'll ever love me like that again

You sent me all those letters
When I went off to school
I should've written you back
But I was too busy being cool

Funny how I couldn't wait
To get you on the phone to say, "Mom, I'm in love"
You were there whether or not
I gave a little or a lot it was enough

I can still hear you sayin' you're proud of me
And I remember thinkin' of you as my friend
I miss you wavin' from the front door, I can't drive by there anymore
'Cause no one'll ever love me like that again

I guess, I miss you more today 'cause it's your birthday
And I couldn't bear for you to spend it here alone
Wish I could say this to your face
Instead of talkin' to your name, carved in stone

I can still hear you sayin', you're proud of me
And I can feel your arms around me now and then
There's a hole in my heart in the shape of you, mom
'Cause no one'll ever love me, no one'll ever love me like that again


That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah, shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is


Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me


Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it, lock and key
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is


Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me
You better believe it, you better believe it


Every step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow
Every move you make, you know I'll follow you wherever you go
Baby, you know my love is


Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally (unconditionally)
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me


God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God your mama, and me

My little girl met a new friend just the other day
On the playground at school
Between the tires and the swings
But she came home with tear-filled eyes
And she said to me "Daddy, Alyssa Lies"

Well, I just brushed it off at first
Cause I didn't know how much my little girl had been hurt
Or the things she had seen
I wasn't ready when I said, "You can tell me."
And she said


Alyssa lies to the classroom...
Alyssa lies everyday at school!
Alyssa lies to the teachers
As she tries to cover every bruise

My little girl laid her head down
That night to go to sleep
As I stepped out the room I heard her say
A prayer so soft and sweet:
"God bless my mom and my dad
And my new friend Alyssa
Oh, I know she needs you bad
Because


Alyssa lies to the classroom
Alyssa lies everyday at school
Alyssa lies to the teachers
As she tries to cover every bruise

I had the worst night of sleep in years
As I tried to think of a way to calm her fears
I knew exactly what I had to do
But when we got to school on Monday...I heard the news

My little girl asked me why everybody looked so sad
The lump in my throat grew bigger with every question that she asked
Until I felt the tears run down my face
And I told her that Alyssa wouldn't be at school today

Cause she doesn't lie in the classroom
She doesn't lie anymore at school
Alyssa lies with Jesus
Because there's nothing anyone would do...

Tears filled my eyes
When my little girl asked me why
Alyssa lies
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Tell me why...
Alyssa lies

Politicians, collections
Unionism, opposition
Activism, communism
Skepticism, new vision, down with the old tradition

Vandalism, terrorism
Amunision, demolision
Darwonism, religion
A lot of people making caastrophoic predictions

But I'll be right here loving you
Come what may I know this much is true
As long as this world's spinning like it's supposed to do
I'll be right here loving you

Computerized, organised
Downsize, enterprise
Idolize, criticize
Demoralize, sympathize, talk sweet and tellin lies

Economics, electronics
Atonic, supersonic
Saving whales, crowed jails
America On-Line, e'mail

But I'll be right here loving you
Come what may I know this much is true
As long as this world's spinning like it's supposed to do
I'll be right here loving you

Ecology, technology
Energy, psycology
Evolution, revolution
Everybody's trying to find a new solution

But I'll be right here loving you
Come what may I know this much is true
As long as this world's spinning like it's supposed to do
I'll be right here loving you

As long as this world's spinning like it's supposed to do
I'll be right here loving you

We've only known each other since the moment we met
But it seems like forever to me
I haven't figured out the perfect way to say it yet
But I suppose at times like these
A man should get down on his knees

How'd ya like to be in my wedding
How'd ya like to walk down the isle
You could be the center of attention
Everyone would look at you and smile
We could send our friends invitations
You could wear a long white dress
If you'd like to be in my wedding, darlin
All ya have to do is say, "Yes"

Your folks could be seated in the very front row
And cry when we all turn to look at you
We could cut the cake
And we could strike a pose
Like the little bitty plastic bride and groom

And then begin our life-long honeymoon

How'd ya like to be in my wedding
How'd ya like to walk down the isle
You could be the center of attention
Everyone would look at you and smile
We could send our friends invitations
You could wear a long white dress
If you'd like to be in my wedding, darlin'
All ya have to do is say, "Yes"

Say, "Yes"
Say, "Yes"
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding)
Please say, "Yes"
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding)
Say, "Yes"
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding)
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding)
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding)

I slammed the door a thousand times
What's mine is mine
What's yours is mine
It's a long drive uphill
Sit back I'm taking the wheel

So many highs so many lows
You move too quick to ever show
Exactly how you feel
So I'm takin' the wheel

Chorus:
Everybody says it can't be done
We drive each other crazy but
You're still the one
You make it hard to stay
Harder to run

You and me we're quite a pair
We make a mess out of thin air
You know I love you still
But I'm takin' the wheel

Repeat Chorus

It's a knock-down drag-out fight
Tongue-tied and twisted we can go all night
You're comin' with me and here's the deal
Baby slide on over
I'm takin' the wheel

So many roads we're left to take
So much history to make
We bend but we don't break

Repeat Chorus

It's a knock-down drag-out fight
Tongue-tied and twisted we can go all night
You're comin' with me and here's the deal
Baby slide on over

And leavin' this crazy tug-of-war
Only makes me want you more
You're comin' with me that's how I feel
Baby slide on over
I'm takin' the wheel

Oh yeah

I slammed the door a thousand times
What's mine is mine
What's yours is mine
It's a long drive uphill
Sit back I'm taking the wheel

How in this world
Can we put a man on the moon
And still have a need
For a place like St. Judes
And why is one man born
In a place where all they know is war
A guy like me
Has always been free

And how can two people
Who built a loving home
Try for years
And never have a child of their own
And somewhere out there tonight
There is a baby no ones holding tight
In need of love
To me that don't add up

But I wasn't there the day you filled up the ocean
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess you
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have

And why did my cousin
Have to die in that crash
A good kid
Only seventeen
I still wonder 'bout that
It seems unfair to me
Some get the chance to chase their dreams
And some don't
What do I know

I wasn't there the day You filled up the ocean
I didn't get to see You hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess You
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have

Why do I feel like
You hear these prayers of mine
When so many outta be
Ahead of me in line
When you look down on me
Can you see the good through all the bad
These are just a few questions I had

I watched him take the two strike call
He hadn't tried to swing at all
I guess he had all he could take
He walked away for goodness sake
His father's voice was loud and mean
"You won't amount to anything"

That little boy quit trying
He just walked away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you

That old man said, "One more try
I know I'm not too old to drive
I promise son, I'll do my best
This time I'm gonna pass the test"
"Give me the keys dad and get in"
His father never drove again

That old man quit trying
He just turned away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you

We take his name out of schools
The lawyers say it breaks the rules
Pledge of allegiance can not be read
And under God should not be said
I wonder how much he will take
I just pray it's not too late

What if God quit trying
He just turned away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you

Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you...


You only love me for my big sunglasses
And my Tony Lamas
And my Dodge Dart Classic
You said "I'll be Johnny and you'll be June
I'll ride with you to the moon"
But guess what?


You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh


Oh, heaven help me
I been sowwin' wildflower seeds
And chasin' tumbleweeds
But that's just who I be
And you're just tryin' to slow this rolling stone
But I'm on to you babe
So guess what?


You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh


Oh, you only love me for my big sunglasses and my Tony Lamas
I live in Oklahoma
And I've got long, blonde hair
And I play guitar and I go on the road
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
And I ain't about drama y'all
I love my apron
But I ain't your momma
So guess what?
What?!


You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh


I am not gonna lay around and whine and moan for somebody that done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I am gonna sit around and sing some old sad song
I believe it's half full not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last


I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone put it in stone "He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time


Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do but I like to do just what I like
I take the chance, dance the dance, it might be wrong but then again it might be right
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it I say bring on anything


I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone put it in stone "He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time

At a red stop light in some sleepy town
An old truck pulled up with the windows down
That song from the past was playin' full blast

And all at once I was seventeen
And my car became a time machine
And all those years just disappeared

I could almost see my Janie beside me
Her bare feet up on the dash
And the boy I was, was stirred up inside me
Tuggin' my heart and takin' me back

Hey, yeah, yeah, that summer song
We cranked it up and sang out strong
Every night we danced 'till dawn
And listened to it over and over

Hey, yeah, that summer song
We learned about love as we went along
Those glory days may be long gone
This feelin' still lives on
In that summer song, that summer song

On the night of the day I got my first car
I grabbed my brand new keys
And my old guitar, I picked up my girl
Man, I owned the world

And the minute that we parked out on White Lake Road
There it was again on my radio
Just in time
As her lips met mine

Oh well, I can't help wonderin' where Janie is now
Is she still stealin' hearts like she used to do?
Maybe she's somewhere listenin' somehow
Tuned in at this moment and feelin' it too

Hey, yeah, yeah, that summer song
We cranked it up and sang out strong
Every night we danced 'till dawn
And listened to it over and over

Hey, yeah, that summer song
We learned about love as we went along
Those glory days may be long gone
This feelin' still lives on in that summer song

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, that summer song
We cranked it up and sang out strong
Those glory days may be long gone
This feelin' still lives on in that summer song
That summer song, that summer song


It don’t matter what plans I got, I can break ‘em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don’t mind telling all the guys “I can’t meet ‘em”
Hell, we can all go raise some hell any other night
Girl, I don’t care, oh, I just gotta see what you’re wearing
Your hair, is it pulled up or falling down?
Oh, I just have to see it now


If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime


Ain’t a spot downtown that’s rockin’ the way that you rock me
Ain’t a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I’m gone so long, hang on. I’ll meet you in a minute or two


If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime


If it’s two in the morning and you’re feeling lonely
And wondering what I’m doing


If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime
Baby, you can crash my party anytime


I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough?
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up?
How did my mom and my dad ever do it?
If there was struggles, then we never knew it
I guess they had each other
That was enough


You know you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart


What am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV?
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up
Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And know we got each other
That's what's up


Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart


You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart


Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love, love, love, love, love (like there's no such thing)
You gotta love, love, love, love, love (as a broken heart)
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

Spoken:
Tone deaf, tone deaf

Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh
Da da da da da da

You say you're gun shy
I say you're spineless
You think you're pensive
I think you're mindless
Such a busy little drone
That your heart beats in monotones
So loud you can't hear me
Repetition's what you need

Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Let me give you a tip, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself

Ahh-ahh, da da da da da da da da

You say you're complicated
I say too dramatic
You think I underrate you
I think I've finally had it
With you never having time
'Cause half the time you spend
Designing brilliant tragedies
And it's becoming your disease, oh

Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Let me give you a tip, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself

Won't let you unnerve me
(You try to sting me like a pearl)
Won't let you deserve me
(And toss me from your tilt-o-whirl)
And even if I kiss the dirt you're gonna see
How I don't hurt
And I don't hurt
I don't hurt

Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Um, let me give you a tip, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself

Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Get over yourself, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself

Get over yourself
Get over yourself

La la la la la la la la la la...

(Fade)

It's another day after another night
Another sun I never thought I'd see rise
High heel hopes and whiskey lies
Ohhh-hoo
Feels like a freight train is running right though my head
My little black dress smells like cigarettes
A Napkin with no name, just an address
Had me a good time... I guess

How am I gunna get my life together
As old as its gettin' it ain't gettin' any better
I don't know where to start
I'm fallin' so far behind
Mama says I gotta start acting like a lady
Daddy's just worried 'bout his baby
How am I supposed to straighten up and fly right
When I don't even remember what I did last night

Shelly said she saw me hanging on an astronaut... not
Lettin him lie though his teeth cause his smile was hot
I'm sittin here suckin' down second thoughts

A little hair of the dog... i know this has got to stop

How am I gunna get my life together
As old as its gettin' it ain't gettin' any better
I don't know where to start
I'm falling so far behind
Mama says I gotta start acting like a lady
Daddy's just worried 'bout his baby
How am I supposed to straighten up and fly right
When I don't even remember what I did last night

OoOoOoh

How am I gunna get my life together
As old as its gettin' it ain't gettin' any better
I don't know where to start
I'm falling so far behind
Mama says I gotta start acting like a lady
Daddy's just worried about his baby
How am I supposed to straighten up and fly right
When I don't even remember........ What I did last night

Bare feet on southern soil
Burning up in the August heat
Tall grass and butterflies
We're all praying for breeze

I'm going down to the river
Gonna wade into my knees
Rest a while there on herd bank
Under the cypress trees

There's a back rout in my mind
Taking me back here every time
And it's all mine it waits for me
If only in a daydream

Cause it's long gone and it's in my past
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be
Honeysuckle sweet, honeysuckle sweet

In the evening on the back porch
You can see the stars like you've never seen
Patsy singing that sweet old song
I'm dancing on my daddy's feet

Oh, I was growing fast
I was restless as the wind
Too young to know that once you leave
You'll never be the same again

But there's a back rout in my mind
Taking me back here every time
And it's all mine it waits for me
If only in a daydream

Cause it's long gone and it's in my past
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be
Honeysuckle sweet, honeysuckle sweet

I try to reach back in time
And touch those summer days
But as each year passes by
I feel them starting to fade
Oh they're fading away, yeah, yeah

But there's a back rout in my mind
Taking me back there every time
And it's all mine it waits for me
If only in a daydream

Cause it's long gone and it's in my past
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be
Honeysuckle sweet

Come on wind won't you take me home
I want to see how that grass has grown
Dirty water won't you wash me clean
Honeysuckle sweet

Ooh, I smell it on the vine
I got to taste it one more time
It's all coming back to me and it's
Sweet, it's honeysuckle sweet

So sweet, so sweet
So sweet, so sweet
Honeysuckle sweet


Once upon a time
Somewhere in your past
Someone said forever
But that promise didn't last
Now you don't believe
Love is ever true
Steel yourself against the day
When I stopped loving you


When the day comes that I don't love you
Every star will fall out of the sky
And every mountain will tumble down
And every river run dry


Every drop of rain
That ever touched the ground
For every tear that ever fell
And never made a sound
I'll be there
To hear you call
And I'll be there to catch you baby
Should you ever fall




Brady was a baseball star
Til he struck out and took his car and drove away
Sissy lost her little boy
Hitch-hiked up to Illinois, so they say
Then it rained so hard that Mary tried
To take her life with suicide
And disappear just like the thunder
You ask around and no-one knows
Where they went or what they do
But you wonder, I know you wonder


Where do they go?
They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
They’re in need of a mindbender
I’m a bartender
At the end of the day
I’m all they’ve got
Hope on the rocks


Charlie’s wife filed for divorce
And Charlie bought a quarter horse and now he's ridin' fences
Upside down and couldn’t pay
They hauled Sue's mobile home away
And we ain’t seen her since
Larry’s long time fiancé
Got kicked out of the P.T.A
And moved her kids back east with someone else
All and the ones you used to know
Don’t drop in or say hello
But you ask yourself
I know you ask yourself


Where do they go?
They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
They’re in need of a mindbender
I’m a bartender
At the end of the day
I’m all they’ve got
Hope on the rocks




Where do they go?
They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
They’re in need of a mindbender
I’m a bartender
At the end of the day
I’m all they’ve got
Hope on the rocks

There she goes
Little black dress on
Standing with the other girls
Wearing velvet and pearls looking so fine, so fine
All the times that she tried to catch my eye
Now I hear that she's crushing on another guy
Why do we always want what we can't have? (oh oh)

I never really wanted, never really wanted that girl
I never really wanted, wanted her in my world
I never really wanted that girl, oh but now I do, yeah

Never noticed how
A woman's eyes can dance
But from the outside in, looks like they're dancing for him
Leaves me wondering, wondering
Why is it now I see her in a different light?
If I could turn back time I would tonight
Why do we always want what we can't have? (oh oh)

I never really wanted, never really wanted that girl
I never really wanted, wanted her in my world
I never really wanted that girl, oh but now I do, oh yeah

You better get that girl while the getting's good
There's list of fools who wish they could
Why do we always want what we can't have?

Oh, I never really wanted, never really wanted that girl
I never really wanted, wanted her in my world
I never really wanted that girl, oh but now I do, oh yeah

I never really wanted, never really wanted that girl
I never really wanted, wanted her in my world
I never really wanted that girl, oh but now I do
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh yeah


To the bag packed, first love leaver
The heart cracked, double down dreamer
The homesick for grass that's greener
And a slice of Mama's peach pie


To the flat broke, couch cushion gas money
The worker bee that ain't gettin' no honey
Missin' someone all the while runnin'
Gunnin' for the brighter lights


Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Hear a song from a band that saves ya, man
It's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night


We've all got a number that we don't wanna drunk dial
And a good friend we ain't seen in a while
And a slow dance left in these boots
And a chance at putting down new roots


Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Hear a song from a band that saves ya, man
It's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night


Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Meet a girl outside  Atlanta, man
It's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
You're just singing along with your drink riased
A pretty little blonde thing's looking your way
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night
Yeah, it's making the best of the worst day kind of night


Oh
Here's to the breakups
It's that kinda night

You hold onto hope
She'll change her mind
Come runnin' back
Straight back to you
You hold onto the past
Won't set it free
You keep makin' wishes
That just won't come true

Chorus:
Well baby, let go of what used to be
Hold onto me
And let go of what makes you lonely
Hold onto me
And give up the heartache
The nights you lie awake
It's easy to set it free
And hold onto me

Cause you need a rock
And that's what I'll be
You'll always know
Where my heart stands
Don't be afraid
I'll catch your fall
You gotta trust me
Just take my hand

Chorus

I won't let you go
Oh hold onto me
Oh baby baby, Oooh

Hold onto me
Give up the heartache
The nights you lie awake
It's easy to set it free
Hold onto me

Hold
Hold onto me
Yeah
Hold onto me
Ooh
Hold onto me
Ooh yeah
Hold onto me
Yeah


Woke up this mornin' with my cellphone ringin'
She said, "I know that when you called me, you were drinking
But I loved every single word you left on my phone
And I know you're hung-over but I'm comin' on over"
Did I say we'd go shoppin', That I'd Louis Vuitton her
That I'd Rodeo Drive her, Slide a Tiffany diamond on her


What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say


Last thing I remember, I was thinking I'd call her up and
Put her on speaker while the whole bar sang Free Bird
Had that phone in my hand when I ran into trouble
My friend comin' over with a couple of doubles


What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say


Did I say we'd go shoppin', That I'd Louis Vuitton her
That I'd Rodeo Drive her, Slide a Tiffany diamond on her?
Did I tell her she could move in and we'd fly out to Vegas
Champagne all the way and we'd get married by Elvis


What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say


What the hell did I say?
What the hell did I say?

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

I wanna see the world
I wanna touch your face
I wanna go right there
And never leave that place

I wanna fall back down
I wanna lose the day
I wanna get it back
In the baddest way

I know it's there
Still see us there
How'd we get away
How'd we get away

Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Us again
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh

We were a Friday night
After a football game
We were the coolest car
Moving down the interstate

Oh, I know it's there
Still see us there
How'd we get away
How'd we get away

Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again

Soaked us, deep in love
We would fall every time
We got back up
So we laid there
And just lose tonight
So Baby why don't I

Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We went every time, yeah

Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again

If we can be us again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

Blame the whiskey on the beer
Blame the beer on the whiskey
Blame the mornin’ on the night
For whose lyin’ here with me
Blame the bar for the band
Blame the band for the song
Blame the song for the party that went all night long

But it ain’t my fault
No it ain’t my fault
Mighta had a little fun
Lotta wrong got done
But it ain’t my fault

Blame the heart for the hurtin’
Blame the hurtin’ on the heart
Blame the dark on the devil
Blame the devil on the dark
Blame the ex for the drinkin’
Blame the drinkin’ for the ex
Blame the two for one tequila’s for whatever happens next

But it ain’t my fault
No it ain’t my fault
Mighta had a little fun
Lotta wrong got done
But it ain’t my fault

I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I’m only guilty of a damn good time
No it ain’t my fault

Blame my raisin' on my name
Blame my name on my raisin'
Blame my lack of knowing better on public education
Blame smoke on the fire
Blame fire on the smoke
Blame the fight on the bouncer that couldn’t take a joke
But it ain’t my fault

I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I’m only guilty of a damn good time

No it ain’t my fault
No it ain’t my fault
No it ain’t my fault


You were raised on an asphalt farm
Ain't never heard a rooster crow
Never walked barefoot by a river
Felt the mud up between your toes


You never rolled in the hay
You never thrown it in four wheel
Climb up on in here girl
Let me show you how country feels


Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels


Never watched the sun go down
From the bed of a pickup truck
Ever been so into somebody
You're still lying there when it comes back up


Girl what do you say?
Cut a path through that cornfield
Park down by the water
Let me show you how country feels


Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

Let your hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off


Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how
Country feels

Country feels


You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up


Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground


And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love


It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast


To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love


I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love


Like our chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love


Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love


God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy


From God our heavenly father
The blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Fear not said the angel
Let nothing you affright
This day is born a savior
Of the pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's power and might
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear savior lay
They found him in the manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeled down
And to the Lord did pray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy


God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day


Well baby since I met you, I've never been the same
There's never been a woman made me feel this way
And I know days are harder, and I know things have changed
But baby goodbye you know I just can't say
Where'd all the love go
I need you to know
I'm singing out to you
Tell me there's something I can do


Radio waves, can you hear me singing out
I've got something to say
Can't you hear I need you now
I'm calling on the two of us so we can be saved
Listen to my radio waves


Clear across the city, you're lying in your bed
Here I am regretting every word unsaid
The only way I know to help you understand
Is say what's going on the only way I can
Broadcast over FM
Here we are again
I'm singin' out to you
Tell me there's something we can do



Here you come knockin' on my heart like a sledge hammer
Tearin' down these walls I built so high
I'm tryin' to hide the truth behind all this false glamour
But somehow the truth still shows up in my eyes

Got a smile painted on my face
Got my heartache locked away prayin' you won't see
Stayin' steady, stayin' strong
Actin' like there's nothin' wrong 'til you look at me
Won't win this fight I surrender
So turn another page of this pretender

Sometimes I think I put it all behind me and I'm finally healing
If you judge a book by it's cover then I'm alright
For a moment I find some piece of mind that my heart is stealing
Looks like I'm livin' it up but I'm dyin' down deep inside
Oh yeah

Got a smile painted on my face
Got my heartache locked away prayin' you won't see
Stayin' steady, stayin' strong
Actin' like there's nothin' wrong 'til you look at me
Won't win this fight I surrender
So turn another page of this pretender

Won't win this fight I surrender
Mmm Mmm turn another page of this pretender
Pretender, still your pretender
Turn another page
Pretender, still your pretender
I'm livin' a lie I can't deny it
Pretender, still your pretender
It's never ending, I'm always pretending
Pretender, still your pretender

He's been sitting by the phone since she left
But it's time for work and he just can't be late
So he grabs his old guitar
And he plays a couple bars on the machine
And then he softly sings

Chorus
It doesn't matter what you've done, I still love you
It doesn't matter where you've been, you can still come home
And honey if it's you, we've got a lot of making up to do
And I can't hug you on the phone, so hurry home

Well the message light was blinking when he got back
It was an old friend calling cause he just heard the news
He says Man I hope you find her
If I see her I'll remind her that her dad is worried
And want her to know

Chorus
It doesn't matter what you've done, I still love you
It doesn't matter where you've been, you can still come home
And honey if it's you, we've got a lot of making up to do
And I can't hug you on the phone, so hurry home

Well the days dragged by without a word from her
And it looked like she might not be coming back
People said man don't you think it's time to take that old message off
He said no, you never know when she might call

She was just outside a bar in New York City
Her so-called friends had left her all alone
She was scared he wouldn't want her
But she dialed up that old number and let it ring
And then she heard him sing

Chorus
It doesn't matter what you've done, I still love you
It doesn't matter where you've been, you can still come home
And honey if it's you, we've got a lot of making up to do
And I can't hug you on the phone, so hurry home

He walked in just in time to hear her say
Dad, I'm on my way

I sure do hope this is a long night
Cause I have never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes, I'm falling
A little more and more

Looks like we started us a fire
Wrapped up in flames of desire
With every touch, they're burning higher
Two shadows dancing on the wall

With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

We'll fall asleep here in the moonlight
In tangled sheets, we'll be here all night
And when we wake up in the morning
We might stay like this all day

Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With every tender little kiss

Nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

By the time you read this letter I'll be gone
I'm not the man I was when I left home
By the time you see my face I will have aged
Much more than the passing of the days

This many miles might as well be the moon
It's a desolate place and I'm missing you
My heart can't believe what my eyes they have seen
God knows what's pulling us through
In a world gone insane, I've whispered your name
I'm missing you

Sometimes in the quiet of the night
I reach for you as if you're by my side
When everything around me seems all gone
The thought of holding you keeps me hangin' on

This many miles might as well be the moon
It's a desolate place and I'm missing you
My heart can't believe what my eyes they have seen
God knows what's pulling us through

In a world gone insane, I've whispered your name
Oh,I'm missing you
In a world gone insane, I whisper your name
I'm missing you...

I hear he's out there
Somewhere
Been looking for him everywhere
From Roswell to Timbuktu
I thought I found him once at a Jiffy Lube
But it turned in
To a dead end
So I got my oil changed and I tried again
He was a major in archaeology
I was digging on him but he wasn't on me
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

I met a mystic down in Memphis
We stood at the foot of the pyramid
He had me looking east
He had me looking west
Then he sold me a map and said I wish you the best
There was Elvis
Not the real one
When he told me goodbye he called me hon'
Just another shot in the dark
Like El Dorado or Noah's Ark
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

Oh yeah it is
It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

I said a girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis
Trying to find Atlantis
Yeah
Oh I'm still trying to find Atlantis
Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis
Like trying to find Atlantis

You got a lock on your heart, it's chained in the dark
Somehow you lost the key
You said you tried everything to get love back again
But baby you ain't tried me
Bet I could break on through
If you want me to

Tell me what it takes to put a smile on your face
And leave your lonely days behind
I can take it from there, get you floatin' on air
Girl, if you just give me a sign
That you want me to
Do you want me to?

My heart's skippin' like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel, couldn't fall any farther
Help me, what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too

Out of all the million things that I might dream for
I can only think of one
And it's me and you sailin' under the blue
Underneath the golden sun
All I want is you
Do you want me too?

My heart's skippin' like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel, couldn't fall any farther
Help me, what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too

My heart's skippin' like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel, couldn't fall any farther
Help me, what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too


I know how to hold a grudge
I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down, the hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aw honey I won't lie


I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be


I’ve pinned a lot of demons to the ground
I’ve got a few old habits left
But there’s still one or two I might need you to help me get
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday you’ll see
There’s a diamond under all this dust


I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be


I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be


Well I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town, hey wouldn't you know
I get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico, oh
Now you're walking up asking me to dance
Smiling that smile and reaching out your hand
Well there's a move or two, I'd like to show you
While I still got the chance


Well you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music


Oh oh, why wouldn't I wanna stay?
Oh oh, and let that plane fly away, hey hey


Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
The beat of the music


I think I could get used to that steel drum playing
Waking up on a beach if you know what I'm saying
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on baby cause


You got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
We're falling in love to the  beat of the music
To the  beat of the music

Get the keys to the car, fill it up with gas
Go down To the bank and pull out a little cash
Forget about the yard, forget about the trash
Let's get a little sun
'Cause it's 5 o'clock and the whistle blows
I've been working overtime eight days in a row
Grab a change of clothes and get ready, let's go
And have a little fun
Good times, it's a good time to let the good times roll
Mile after mile, smile after smile
Headin' down the line
Hey we're having good times
Let's not worry about things gone bad
'Cause life's too good to live so sad
Worn down, torn down, tired and trapped
Hey forget about that
Good times, it's a good time to let the good times roll
Mile after mile, smile after smile
Headin' down the line
Hey we're having good times
Oooh roll down the windows baby, feel the wind blow
Ohh turn up the radio, turn up the radio, hey turn up the radio
Good times, it's a good time to let the good times roll
Mile after mile, smile after smile
Headin' down the line
Hey we're having good times

Don't you wanna dive on in? Yeah the water feels right
Dancin' on the edge of the love you're a beautiful sight
So why're you still standin' there in the half moonlight

Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Come on, baby, give me a little more you

You're battin' those baby blues and honey I swear
The way you got me needing you, girl it just ain't fair
You've given me a little bit yeah, but don't stop there
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Come on, baby, give me a little more you

I'm here fallin' for you, my heart's callin' for you
I know I never can get enough
Don't hold back one bit of your love
Strong and steady for you, I'm all ready
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Come on, baby, give me a little more

You're teasin' me with a touch and the whole world shakes
Keep holdin' that river back and the levee may break
There's only so much that this ol' boy can take
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Yeah, come on, baby, give me a little more you

I'm here fallin' for you, my heart's callin' for you
I know I never can get enough
Don't hold back one bit of your love
Strong and steady for you, I'm all ready
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Come on, baby, give me a little more you
Come on, baby, give me a little more

Ooh, give me a little more
You give me a little more
You give me a little more
You give me a little more

If I won me the lottery
I'd dance naked in the street, with a top hat full of money
And you'd wanna get to know me
If I won me the lottery

And if I was a movie star
I'd sip honey from a pickle jar, in the back of my limosine
And they'd call me an icon
And I'd be lookin back at you from the cover of a People magazine

I guess it's all for the takin
I guess it's all yours and mine
My sister says I've got to see it, to believe it
And I believe it
I believe it

Well I'm just an outsider
I'm livin in a trailer, with a black and white TV set
If only I was president
Ya know I'd paint the white house pink
And never have to pay the rent
If only I was president

I guess it's there for the taking
I think it's all yours and mine
My preacher says I've got to see it, and believe it
And I believe it
I won't sleep til i've had enough (I believe it)
I won't sip my wine from no paper cup
(I believe) I won't sleep til I've had enough
Until I've had enough

Delicious surprise
Now I do believe, now it's there all the time
Inside, I knew it all the time

I got me somethin to believe in
But all I really want now is a handful of salvation

And I believe
I won't sleep til I've had enough (I believe it)
I won't sip my wine from no paper cup
(I believe) I won't sleep til I've had enough
Until ive had enough
Til i've had enoooough....mmmm

1st Verse

I don't care if it comes in a bottle
I don't care if it comes in a can
I don't care if it's stirred or shaken
Man, could you give me one for both hands

Chorus

If it goes down easy
(Yeah) it makes you feel good
If it goes down easy
It makes you feel good

2nd Verse

Sign on the wall said no dancin' on the tables
She never lets the rules get in her way
No, she don't
She got da whole joint jumpin' and goin' crazy, ha ha ha
She grabbed my hand and danced me right outta the place
Out of the place

(Repeat Chorus)
Bridge

Might be one 'a those fine French wines
Might be some good ol' damn homebrew
Long as we get to have a good time
Most times anything will do

(Repeat Chorus)
Spoken

Oh, that sound is sweet to me, man
Listen here now

3rd Verse

There're things in life that just keep gettin' better
Ah, yeah
I said no, but I guess maybe I meant yes, ha ha ha
Hey, she insisted, so I just had to let her
When it's that smooth who really cares what anybody says
I don't

Tag Chorus

(So if it goes down easy)
(It makes you feel good)
It makes you feel good
(If it goes down easy)
(It makes you feel good)
(If it goes down easy)
Keep it comin' baby, fill up my glass
(It makes you feel good)
It's killin' me and I like it like that
(If it goes down easy)
Maybe we shouldn't, maybe we should
(It makes you feel good)
All I know is it makes you feel good
(If it goes down easy)
I makes you feel good
(It makes you feel good)

Don't know how you do it
Like there's nothing to it
You just look my way
You come a little closer

I lose my composure
Don't know what to say
I'm overwhelmed, you smile
I melt
And somewhere inside
Oh, baby, I

Shiver, tremble, I never
No I never once felt so much
It shakes me how you take me
Deeper then I've ever been
It's to the core, under my skin I
Shiver

I love the way your whisper
Slowly, softly lingers
In my ear
You move a little lower
The world starts spinning slower
Then it disappears
Your lips so close, we kiss almost
Just barely touch, but that's enough
To make me

Shiver, tremble, I never
No I never once felt so much
It shakes me how you take me
Deeper then I've ever been
It's to the core, under my skin I
Shiver

It shakes me
How you take me
Deeper tthen I've ever been
It's to the core, under my skin

I shiver, tremble, I never
No I never once felt so much
It shakes me how you take me
Deeper then I've ever been
It's to the core, under my skin
I shiver
Shiver

I like to see you in your cotton dress
Early in the morning with your hair all a mess
Oh baby, that's what I like about you

I like the funny way you wrinkle your nose
I like the color that you paint your toes
Oh honey, that's what I like about you

And you know that I love you
I'm so proud to be your man
And I love the way you love me too
Just the way I am, that's what I like about you

It's funny honey, but I swear it's true
I love every crazy little thing you do
Oh darlin', that's what I like about you

I like it when you start to sing along
And you got nothin' but the radio on
Oh mercy, that's what I like about you

Oh baby, oh honey, oh darlin', oh mercy
You know it's true, that's what I like about you

And you know that I love you
I'm so proud to be your man
And I love the way you love me too
Just the way I am, that's what I like about you

That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
Oh you know it's true

Strong, strong as a mountain
The one you can count on, that's how my love is for you
Sure as forever we'll be together
'till the skies no longer blue
I know it won't always be easy, when we need to be strong baby believe me

Chorus:
I'll do whatever it takes to hold on to your love
Swim every ocean if thats not enough
Walk to the end of the earth through the cold pouring rain to hold on to your love
I'll do whatever it takes

Brave, I'm not that brave
But there's not a day I wouldn't take on the world for you
And fight, baby I'd die
There's nothing I wouldn't go through just for you
My heart is eternally yours, just to be in your arms
Is what I'm living for

Chorus:
I'll do whatever it takes to hold on to your love
Swim every ocean if thats not enough
Walk to the end of the earth through the cold pouring rain to hold on to your love
I'll do whatever it takes

Chorus:
I'll do whatever it takes to hold on to your love
Swim every ocean if thats not enough
Walk to the end of the earth through the cold pouring rain to hold on to your love
I'll do whatever it takes

Ooooo........


All your pretty bags are packed
Forever sure did go by fas
I hope you find the skies are blue
The grass is green and the road is smooth


You go your way, c'est la vie sweet baby
Here's hoping that you don't hate me
Who knows you might just maybe miss me out there
It ain't about who's right or wrong
Love Dies and life goes on
Had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
You go your way and I'll go crazy


I poured some bourbon in a coffee cup
It's been too long since I drank too much
So here's to me and here's to the moon
And here's to love that ends too soon


You go your way, c'est la vie sweet baby
Here's hoping that you don't hate me
Who knows you might just maybe miss me out there
It ain't about who's right or wrong
Love Dies and life goes on
Had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
You go your way and I'll go crazy
Yeah it ain't about who's right or wrong
Love dies and life goes on
Had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
You go your way and I'll go crazy
I'll go crazy


Staring at you taking off your makeup
Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do, but baby, you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone


I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, for me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling


Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up
You're standing on the front porch looking just like that
Remember that


I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, for me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling


I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling

My motorcycle needs an oil change
Fence needs mending, house needs paint
I got a million things that need to be done but
Baby I can only focus on one

The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're everything I shouldn't be thinking about

Baby you've always had a one track mind
So what you're saying ain't no surprise
What may come as a shock to you
Is that I'm having all those little thoughts too yea

The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're everything I shouldn't be thinking about

Baby since you and me are on the same page
Let's do something 'bout it, what do you say, ay?

The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about

The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're everything I shouldn't be thinking about


American girls and American guys
We’ll always stand up and salute, we’ll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying there’s a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head


My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free


Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July


Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue


Oh, justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you’ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A
`Cause we`ll put a boot in your ass, it`s the American way


Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue


Oh, oh
Of the red, white and blue
Oh, oh
Of my red, white, and blue


Shotgun houses, shanty shacks
Countin' those ties on the railroad track
Thirty-four more, it's almost time
To see my baby walking out of that


Coalmine, covered with dust
T-shirt tired, all muscled up
All mine, head to toe
Come on, come on, whistle, blow


I can't wait to get him home
Ain't gonna have nothing but the supper on
Gonna keep him busy 'til its time
He goes back to that coalmine
Some girls like them gussied up
Wearing all that smelly stuff
To me there's nothing quite so fine
As my man standing in front of that




Power's out, well that's all right
We'll make love by a miner's light
Gonna keep him busy 'til its time
He goes back to that coalmine
Shotgun houses, shanty shacks
Countrin' those ties on the railroad track
Just two more, it's almost time
To see my baby walking out of that




Don't want no white-collared man
Midnight, I like calloused hands
To keep me busy 'til its time
He goes back to that coalmine
I can't wait to get him home
Ain't gonna have nothing but the supper on
Power's out, well that's all right
We'll make love by a miner's light
Don't want no white-collared man
Midnight, I live calloused hands
To keep me bust 'til its time
He goes back to that coalmine

Baby what do you say we go down by the river
Down by the river under that moon
Spend all night down by the river
You loving on me, me loving on you

Throw a blanket down on the bank of that river
Bank of that river, that's what I wanna do
Roll round and round on the bank of that river
You loving on me, me loving on you

We'll back up the truck, switch back the key
Crank up some tunes and turn up the heat
Nobody gonna know, nobody gonna see

Baby what do you say we go down by the river
Down by the river, under that moon
Spend all night down by the river
You loving on me, me loving on you

Well, I bet them stars are dancing on the river
Dancing on the river, under that moon
Waitin' on us to get to that river
You loving on me, me loving on you

Jump out of these jeans and into that river
Into that river that's begging us to
Make a little steam on top of that river
You loving on me, me loving on you

We'll back up the truck, switch back the key
Crank up some tunes and turn up the heat
Nobody gonna know, nobody gonna see

Baby what do you say we go down by the river
Down by the river, under that moon
Spend all night down by the river
You loving on me, me loving on you, you, oh

Baby what do you say we go down by the river
Down by the river, what do you say
What do you say we go down by the river
Down by the river, what do you say
What do you say we go down by the river (Come on baby)
Down by the river, what do you say (Down by the river)
What do you say we go down by the river (Whoa yeah)
Down by the river, what do you say
What do you say we go down by the river (Down by the river)
Down by the river, what do you say
What do you say we go down by the river (Down by the river)
Down by the river, what do you say
What do you say we go down by the river (Down by the river)
Down by the river, what do you say
What do you say we go down by the river (Down by the river)
Down by the river, what do you say


Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll


Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."


Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night


Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."


Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
Gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure


Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."
Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."
Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart
Keep on dreamin'
Don't let it break your heart

My god what have I done
You gave me your heart
And I broke it up
Now here I am

All alone and I'm hatin' me
Cuz' baby with you I had everything
Now I'm a nothin' man

Not sure what I do from here
Or where I'll go
Baby the only thing I know is

CHORUS:
I'll never find another you
Someone who moves me like you do
Someone that knows me inside out
A love that'll never let me down
I could search all through this world
Try to find another like you girl
But no matter what I do
I'll never find another you

You put yourself in the palm of my hand
I was the envy of every man
And it was beautiful
What a perfect little life we found
We built it up and I tore it all down.....like a fool
How will I ever forgive myself
And how do i live
Knowing I'll never feel that way again

And

CHORUS

Maybe someday I'll find a sweet face
That takes me half the way to where we've been
Oh and who knows maybe i'll come close
But comin' close is all i'll ever get
All i'll ever get

CHORUS

I'll never find another you

Yeah, boys ride bikes and learn to drive
Them old stiff sides in grandpa's drive
Pop the clutch and smell the rubber burn
And it's on

Then it's shootin' cans with no game plan
And playin' air guitar in a rock 'n' roll band
And it's fake I.D.'s and chasin' girls
All night long

Yeah, 'til a woman comes along and lays down the law
Draws that boy a line he ain't gonna cross
It's funny how it's said there ain't a ball and chain that strong
'Til a woman comes along

Yeah, it's fish and golf, foot and eight-ball
Honky-tonks 'til past last call
A lot of raisin' hell
Rebel yellin' and carryin' on

'Til a woman comes along and lays down the law
Draws that boy a line he ain't gonna cross
It's funny how it's said there ain't a ball and chain that strong
'Til a woman comes along

Yeah, that bachelor pad was just a bachelor pad
Dirty jeans and drive-thru sacks
Like a lonely guy in a ramblin' Waylon song

And a woman comes along and lays down the law
Draws that boy a line he ain't gonna cross
It's funny how it's said there ain't a ball and chain that strong
'Til a woman comes along

And lays down the law
Draws that boy a line he ain't gonna cross
It's funny how it's said there ain't a ball and chain that strong
'Til a woman comes along, oh, 'til a woman comes along

Comes along
Comes along
All that until a woman comes along


We said that summer we'd go down to Cancun
But no money makes that kind of hard to do
Forget the beach – I’d rather be here with you
Playing Croquet okay, maybe, that’s not true


But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home


We’ll put on bug spray and we'll lose our clothes
Put out the lawn chairs and turn on the hose
We’ll play Jack Johnson, he’s the new Don Ho
And we’ll go surfing, surfing, we'll surf the radio


But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home


Drink margaritas and take in the sunset
Later on we'll slip up to our king size bed
And make love, love, sweet love


You make it easy, easy
Oh, yes, it's easy, easy


But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home


Let's get away baby
Oh, let's get away, baby
Oh...
Go on a little holiday...


Zat you, Santa Claus?


Gifts I'm preparing
For some Christmas sharing
But I pause because
Hanging my stocking
I can hear a knocking
Zat you, Santa Claus


Sure is dark out
Not the slighest spark out
Pardon my clacking jaws
Uh, who there
Who is it
Uh, stopping for a visit
Zat you, Santa Claus


Are you bringing a present for me
Something pleasantly pleasant for me
That's what I've been waiting for
Would you mind slipping it under the door


Four winds are howling
Or maybe that be growling
My legs feel like straws
Oh my, my, me, my
Kindly would you reply
Zat you Santa Claus
Yeah


Oh hanging my stocking
I can hear a knocking
Zat you, Santa Claus

Yeah, say now
Hey there, who is it
Stopping for a visit
Zat you, Santa Claus


Whoa there Santa you gave me a scare
Now stop teasing beccause I know you're there
We don't believe in no goblins today
But I can't explain why I'm shaking this way


Well I see old Santa in the keyhole
I'll give to the because
One peek and I'll try there
Uh-oh there's an eye there
Zat you, Santa Claus


Please, please
I pity my knees
Say that's you Santa Claus
That's him alright


I thought I knew you from somewhere
Right when you walked through the door
So, please forgive me for staring
It's driving me crazy where I’ve seen you before
Maybe it's the white T-Shirt that you're wearing
And the danger in your eyes or your fingers in your hair
It's a pretty small town, it's coming to me now
Woah, I just figured it out


You look a lot like my next boyfriend
I can't believe how much you act like him
You and me, we'd be unbelievable
And I'm available
No, I don't think it's a coincidence
I put it all together, it makes sense
Boy, you ain't no fling or a could've been
You look a lot like my next boyfriend


You should probably come over
Tell me your name and I’ll tell you mine
I'll probably give you my number
And you can call me anytime
I hope you like red lips, driveway kissing
‘Cause if you want it baby, that's what you'll be getting
Every night, all of the time
Woah, I hope that's alright


You look a lot like my next boyfriend
I can't believe how much you act like him
You and me, we'd be unbelievable
And I'm available
No, I don't think it's a coincidence
I put it all together, it makes sense
Boy, you ain't no fling or a could've been
You look a lot like my next boyfriend


(Next boy, next boyfriend)
You look a lot like my next boyfriend
(Next boy, next boyfriend)
I thought I knew you from somewhere
Right when you walked through the door


You look a lot like my next boyfriend
I can't believe how much you act like him
You and me, we'd be unbelievable
And I'm available
No, I don't think it's a coincidence
I put it all together, it makes sense
Boy, you ain't no fling or a could've been
No, you look a lot like my next boyfriend


(Next boy, next boyfriend)
You look a lot like my next boy, next boy, next boyfriend
(Next boyfriend)
You look a lot like my next boyfriend

You were made to shine under Southern stars
Pure as the mountain rain
You're the love songs pouring out of this guitar
Sweeter than sugarcane

You've got my heart wrapped up like it's down in the holler
Covered in kudzu vines
When the night feels right I'm gonna come a-callin'
I'm gonna make you mine

You're hallelujah, Sunday morning
All I've ever needed, wanted
Underneath this pale moon sky
I'm gonna make you mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make you mine

Gonna take you slow dancing by the water
I just wanna hold you tight
I'm in love with you so, miner's daughter
And I'm gonna make you mine

You're hallelujah, Sunday morning
All I've ever needed, wanted
Underneath this pale moon sky
I'm gonna make you mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make you mine

You're hallelujah, Sunday morning
All I've ever needed, wanted
Underneath this pale moon sky
I'm gonna make you mine

You're hallelujah, Sunday morning
All I've ever needed, wanted
Underneath this pale moon sky
I'm gonna make you mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make you mine

You were made to shine under Southern stars
In my arms tonight
I can feel the beating of your heart
I'm gonna make you mine

Nineteen
Number on his back
Voted captain of his high school football team
He took us all the way to State
Had a scholarship to play down in Tennessee

Said he could run, he could duck
He could throw, he could go
Like you never seen
Nineteen

On the day those twin towers came down
His whole world turned around
He told them all, "Y'all, I can't play ball
There's a war on now"

So he walked right down with a few good men
And joined the Marines
Nineteen

He's the boy next door
He might have carried your bags at the grocery store
Now he's somebody's son in a hole with a gun
In some foreign land
Trying to hold on to his American Dreams, nineteen

There's a sniper out there in the dark somewhere
And a soldier down
Need someone who can run, who can duck
And go get him out

It takes one good man to raise his hand
Take one for the team
How about you, nineteen?

Brought him home today
With the big parade down on main street
Gave him a purple heart, a silver star
Soldier gave a speech

Said, "He could run, he could duck, he could throw
He's the one who rescued me"
Said, "He could have played for Tennessee"

Number nineteen
He was nineteen

People want to know right where I stand
I just keep it simple, I say it's complicated man
Well you got your opinions and I got my views
But since you asked, let's grab a glass and I'll explain it to you

I go to the church, I go to bars
I read the Word, I read the stars
Dixie waves in my front yard
But the stars and stripes are in my heart

Yeah you might see gray but I'm black and white
Not afraid to love, not afraid to fight
I love my mama, hell raising Christian
A midnight run and a walking contradiction

I like my country mixed with a little rock
I plant my corn in rows, but there's weeds in my crop
My dad retired from GM in the spring of '94
Well I'm loyal to my daddy, but hell I drive a Ford

I go to the church, I go to bars
I read the Word, I read the stars
Dixie waves in my front yard
But the stars and stripes are in my heart

Yeah you might see gray but I'm black and white
Not afraid to love, not afraid to fight
I love my mama, hell raising Christian
A midnight run and a walking contradiction

Yeah there a lot of folks out there just like me
We are what we are and we are what you see

We go to the church, we go to bars
We read the Word, we read the stars
Dixie waves in our front yards
But the stars and stripes are in our hearts

Yeah you might see gray, but we're black and white
Not afraid to love not afraid to fight
We love our mamas, hell raising Christians
A midnight run and a walking contradiction

Yeah I love my mama, hell raising Christian
A midnight run and a walking contradiction


I talked to my sister in Memphis
And I told her you were moving to town
Here's her number
She said she'd be glad to show you around
I left a map on your front seat
Just in case you lose your way
But don't worry, once you reach Sallisaw
It's all interstate

I know you need to go
But before you do I want you to know, that I


Wish you the best
And I wish you nothing less
Than every thing you've ever dreamed of
And I hope that you find love along the way
But most of all
I wish you'd stay


I figure right about sundown
You'll be in West Tennessee
And by then
Maybe I'll understand why you had to leave

I know that you've done some changing
And I know there's no changing your mind
And yes I know
We've been through this a thousand times

I'm sorry for still holding on
I'll try to let go and I'll try to be strong, and I'll




Yeah, everything you've ever dreamed of
And I hope that you'll find love along the way
But most of all
I wish you'd stay
I wish you'd stay

(Cat Stevens)

In the midnight moonlight hour
He's walking along that lonely mile
And every time I do
I keep seeing this picture of you

Here comes my baby
Here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well here comes my baby
Here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love
That's oh so fine
Never to be mine no matter how I try

You'll never walk alone
And you're forever talkin' on the phone
And I try to call your name
But every time it comes out the same

Here comes my baby
Here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well here comes my baby
Here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love
That's oh so fine
Never to be mine no matter how I try

Here comes my baby
Here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well here comes my baby
Here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love
That's oh so fine
Never to be mine no matter how I try


When I get off of work on Friday after working like a dog all week
I go to meet the boys for a cold one at a little joint up the street
They got a jukebox in the corner full of old country tunes
Feed it five dollars worth of quarters is the first thing I always do


'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang


Well, I like a lot of kinds of music, I try to keep an open mind
Depending on the mood to strike me if I'm gonna stay till closing time
So when I wanna lift my spirits to get me feeling worth a dang
I know I'm gonna have to hear it 'cause I gotta have some Hank to hang





Everybody gathered where the river runs wider
At the edge of town
To see if that Eddie Lee Vaughn baptism
Was really gonna go down
Folks bet their hard earned money that water wouldn't change a thing
They set the odds at a hundred to one his soul wouldn't never come clean
Then the preacher said, "People take a moment or two
There's something we need to do, pray for the fish"
They won't know what's comin'
When the sin starts rolling off the like's of him
Lord, be with 'em, they ain't done nothin'
Please, won't you leave them just a little bit of room to swim?
Pray for the fish
Well, the preacher ducked 'em under
That cool clear water, then he did it again
Eddie came up yellin', "Lord in Heaven
Halleauh, I'm a brand new man"
Well, the water got to bubblin', sky got to rumblin'
And the thunder backed up the choir, the fish started jumpin'
It was like they was swimmin' in a lake of fire
Then Eddie's momma stepped out of the crowd
And started yellin' out loud, "Pray for the fish"
They won't know what's comin'
When the sin starts rollin' off the like's of him
Lord, be with em, they ain't done nothin'
Please, won't you leave them just a little bit of room to swim?
Pray for the fish
He said, "Everybody cross your fingers
Fold your hands, pray for ole' Eddie
But before we say, Amen
Pray for the fish"
Lord, be with 'em, they ain't done nothin'
Please, won't you leave them just a little bit of room to swim?
Pray for the fish
Lord, pray for the fish


I don't want to rush this thing
I don't want to jump the gun
I really want to say those three little words
But I'm going to bite my tongue
Yeah, I'm just going to lay on back
Leave it on cruise control
I'm gonna hold it all inside
Till the right time comes down the road


I got a feeling
My head's a reeling
My heart is screaming
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a U
I got a feeling
Are you feeling it too


I guess I've all but said it now
So much for hoping you'd go first
Don't leave me hanging out here on a line
Baby, it's your turn
Say you couldn't sleep last night
Swore that you could feel me breathe
Had you wanting me there by your side
Yeah, baby I know what you mean


I got a feeling
My head's a reeling
My heart is screaming
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a U
I got a feeling
Are you feeling it too

I got a feeling
My head's a reeling
My heart is screaming
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a U
I got a feeling
Are you feeling it too


I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same Dear
If you're not here with me


And when the blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue blue blue Christmas


Oh no no no


I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Well it won't be the same Dear
If you're not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
(Blue Christmas, blue blue Christmas)
That's when those blue memories start calling
(Blue Christmas, blue blue Christmas)
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue blue blue Christmas


Baby I'll have a blue blue Christmas
Oh so very blue

A single red rose and a table for two
A nice chardonnay and an ocean view
Ships comin in stars comin' out
We sat and we talked 'til the place closed down
Then we took a long walk down on the beach
Her in that white dress in her bare feet
We stopped and we watched the lighthouse light
I pulled her close and i held on tight
And i said
To myself
It doesn't get better than this
No it doesn't get better than this
And it did
It did
Oh it did
Fast forward to that next spring
We were lookin for a preacher pickin out rings
Family comin in and friends comin out
To that little white church on the outskirts of town
Me and that tux fightin butterflies
Tears of joy in my mama's eyes
Her daddy walkin her down that aisle
I lifted that veil and i saw that smile
And i said
To her
It doesn't get better than this
No it doesn't get better than this
And it did
It did
Oh it did
Just when i start thinkin it's as good as it can get
This crazy life does somethin
Just to let me know
I haven't seen anything yet
Nine months later nearly to the day
There we were flyin down the interstate
Car weavin in and car weavin out
Through traffic runnin every red light in town
Delivery room and the doctor comes in
I'm right beside her she's squeezin my hand
One more push and a baby cries
A sweet little angel with her mama's eyes
And i said
To my girls
It doesn't get better than this
No it doesn't get better than this
And it did
It did
Oh it did
Yes it did
A single red rose and a table for two
A nice chardonnay and an ocean view


We've got barefoot ladies and tricked out mercedes
And people getting crazy on the boulevard
We've got classic colas and ice cold corona's
And big pool parties in the back yard


Hey that's the way we do it
New friends and blue skies that never end
Hey that's the way we like it
Good times, sunshine and summertime


You'll see straw sombreros and t-top cameros
And stereos blasting in the parking lot
You'll see rock hard bodies and bikini hotties
And everybody's got it going on
And showing what they've got




Hey everybody can't you feel the rhythm now
Hey everybody don't you want to party
Hey everybody can't you feel the rhythm now
Hey everybody don't you wanna party




Saw him sitting on a sidewalk in Fresno
Braided hair and a tie-dyed t-shirt on
Talking to himself about Vietnam
About the tour he did and the deal he got
He said this world isn't the same if you ask me
If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be


I'd be rolling on a river with Credence
Stealing kisses from Peggy Sue
I'd be knee-deep in sand on a Panama beach
In the spring of '72
I'd be wasting away on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll in
He said what I wouldn't give just to live those songs again


Saw him working the counter at Walgreen's
With a new haircut and a Bachelor's Degree
Talking to himself about his raw deal
Cursing Uncle Sam and the GI bill
He said This world isn't the same if you ask me
If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be


I'd be rolling on a river with Credence
Stealing kisses from Peggy Sue
I'd be knee-deep in sand on a Panama beach
In the spring of '72
I'd be wasting away on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll in
He said what I wouldn't give just to live those songs again


He said This world isn't the same if you ask me
If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be


I'd be rolling on a river with Credence
Stealing kisses from Peggy Sue
I'd be knee-deep in sand on a Panama beach
In the spring of '72
I'd be wasting away on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll in
He said what I wouldn't give just to live those songs again

I remember way back when i was just a boy
Goin places with my mom and dad
It used to scare me to death, how momma used to act
After six or seven beers she's had
We were sittin at a table when momma got disabled
All the liquor runnin to her head
Soon I got to chokin', daddy wasn't jokin' when he grabbed me by the arm and said...

"Don't look now your momma's got her boobs out showing everybody in town."
Faces gettin' red we were wishin we were dead
There where people standing all around
When when momma gets to drinking there ain't much thinkin'
There's nothing anybody can do
Just hope and pray there never comes a day when my momma's out drinkin' with you

Well, we got her in the truck
And we started drivin' home
When momma said she had to go
Daddy pulled it over
We were standing on the shoulder while mom is puttin' on a show
Then he started up the truck and momma stood up with her pants still around her knees
When we heard momma holler
If ya give me a dollar well I'll let you take a peek at these

"Don't look now, your momma's got her boobs out."
Showin' everybody in town
Faces turning red, we were wishing we were dead
There were people standing all around
When momma gets to drinkin', there ain't much thinkin'
There's nothing anybody can do
Won't you hope and pray, there never comes a day when my momma's out drinking with you
Oh, won't you hope and pray there never comes a day, when my momma's out drinking with you


She rolled in
My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down
Well it was magic in the air
When she caught my eye
We shared three short months
And one long goodbye


She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away


Well she kissed my lips
Down on Ocean Drive
She set my world on fire
On the fourth of July
We wrote our names in the sand
Under the star-soaked sky
But it washed away like she did
With the rising tide


She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away


Every summer that rolls around
I'm looking over my shoulder
Wishing I could see her face
Wishing I could hold her


She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away


Yeah, she was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
She was the one that got away
She rolled in
My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down


I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source


Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool


I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did


Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool


Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby


Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Ask any ol' barstool


I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide

(Johnny Marks)

Well, rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Well, rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone feeling merrily in the new old-fashioned way

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Yeah, rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone feeling merrily in the new old-fashioned way...

We're on a road to nowhere
I don't know how we got there
Some wrong turn somewhere
Maybe I just stopped trying
There's just no justifying and now we're dying

I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but I got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You and me, baby, will end up being
One more sad song

How will I live without you?
Who will I be in these shoes?
Once I've lost all that I can lose
Even if you forgave me
I don't know if I could make it
But that's our whole problem, maybe

I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but I got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You and me, baby, will end up being
One more sad song

About someone who had it all
Let it all go wrong

I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but I got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You and me, baby, will end up being
One more sad song

I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but I got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You and me, baby, will end up being
One more sad song


I just walked in and you were gone
To your Mama's I suppose
It looks like you won't be back so I thought you ought to know
I found that note you left today it only took you half a page
I'm going to grab my old guitar take a pencil from the jar and fill in the empty space


I'm going to tell you how I feel, straight up genuine and real
Open a bottle of ninety proof and write a song for you like Kristofferson would do


In each line you're going to hear it's my fault and I miss you
I know it won't be in time it may not even rhyme
But it has to be is true


I'm going to tell you how I feel, straight up genuine and real
Open a bottle of ninety proof and write a song for you like Kristofferson would do




I'm going to tell you how I feel, straight up genuine and real
Open a bottle of ninety proof and write a song for you like Kristofferson would do


I'm going to drink this bottle of ninety proof and sing this song for you
Like Kristofferson would do


Well I was rolling wheels and shifting gears
Around that Jersey Turnpike
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
Said sir you broke the limit in that rusty old truck
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from


I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from


Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-licking
Well I paid the tab and the lady asked me
How'd I like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it




I was chasing sun on 101
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am, back home
We like the girls that sing soprano




Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
That's rolling on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might have seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa




Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of back porch picking
Where I come from trying to make a living
Working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Staring up at heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
Trying to make a living
Oh, where I come from
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
Get back down there sometimes
Where I come from


I'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights
That's alright cause I don't want to be alone
There's nobody waitin there, cold and empty bed
Words I wished I'd said come on the radio


Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I do this to myself
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're with someone else


But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back, oh, oh


So, I've been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and it's breaking my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made won't fill this empty space


Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I just can't let you go
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're never coming back


But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back oh oh
But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back oh oh


Mmmm
If I could bring you back
Mmmm
Just close my eyes...


Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey
And some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer
Really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
(They know that Santa's on his way

Although it's been said

Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas (x3)
To you

I've never done anything
That would ever bring a tear to your eye
I've never crossed the line
Or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
But darling I'll admit
There've been times when I could have
The thing that kept me strong
Is the one thing that is always on my mind


When I think about cheatin'
I just think about you leavin'
And how my world would fall to pieces
If I tossed your love away
Even when I'm tempted by some stranger
Oh there's never any danger
I just think about you leavin'
When I think about cheatin'

There was a time in Abilene
When he said all the things I wanted to hear
It was hard to turn him down
Between the champagne and the sound of whispers in my ear
But it just took one two-step with someone, and I was missing you
He never had a chance, cause I broke up the dance
Before the song was through




Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol Red

Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail
He's a four legged tracking machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Aren’t nobody got past Red


And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itching to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red will have you tired before the morning comes


Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run
I'd just drop him off and wait


And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itching to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red will have you tired before the morning comes


Now Ol' Red got real used to seeing
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well I made my run with the evening sun
And I smiled when I heard them let Red out
Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south


And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itching to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red will have you tired before the morning comes


Now there's red haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out


It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe, something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand


Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream


The preacher man said "Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt"
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart


Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream
Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream


Oh, this is just a dream
Just a dream
Yeah, yeah


If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away


And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA


From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston,
And New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And its time we stand and say


That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA


And I'm proud to be and American
Where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA


Bobby Joel and Betty got a real nice farm
Everybody knows that they work real hard
Bobby Joel sweating in the noonday sun
Betty right beside him until the work's all done
But every now and then they get a strong desire
To crawl up in the hay and set the barn on fire


Now the hay needs hauling, the hogs needs slop
The corn needs cutting but the tractor's stopped
They climbing up the ladder, clear through the loft
Shucking those dirty old work clothes off
Singing brown chicken, brown cow
(Ain't nobody watching but the)
Brown chicken, brown cow


Black crow sitting on a weather-vane
He can see them coming from a mile away
Yeah, he's caw-caw-cawing out a loud alarm
Hey you all, Bobby Joel and Betty heading for the barn
Now the chicken ain't pecking and the cow won't eat
They're fighting each other for a front row seat



(Ain't nobody watching)


Brown chicken, brown cow
(Ain't nobody watching but)
Brown chicken, brown cow
Only one watching, baby
(Ain't nobody watching)

Oops


Well, she was precious like a flower
She grew wild, wild, but innocent
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
She was everything beautiful and different


Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
Stupid boy
Stupid boy, oh


So what made you think you could take a life
And just push it, push it around
I guess to build yourself up so high
You had to take her and break her down


Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy


Oh, you always had to be right
But now you've lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive
Ooh, yeah


Well, she laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
Yes, you did
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy, oh
I'm the same old, same old stupid boy


It took a while for her to figure out she could run
But when she did, she was long gone, long gone


Ah, she's gone, she's long gone
Yes, she's gone
Yeah, oh
Nobody's ever going to love me like she loved me
And she loved me, she loved me
God, please, just let her know
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Baby
Yeah, I'm down on my knees
She's never coming back to me

Here it go


Well, I won 2 dollars on a scratch-off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought 2 more with it
And I won 10 bucks and that was just right
So, I bought a six pack and a, a bag of ice


You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got
It ain’t like we really need a million dollar yacht cause


We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank


Still, can you imagine if we ever struck it
I’d go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we’d tell our bosses they can do the same
We’ll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing


We’d sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But till that dream comes true why don’t you grab your bikini cause


We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank


However it goes (whatever happens)
We’ve got it made (in these shades)
Cause baby we can float (behind this boat)
We can ride away


We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day
We’re laughing all the way, to the river bank


This rock we're rolling on
Is like a circus ride that don't last long
Round and round we go and then we're gone
We waste time chasing ghosts
And overlook the things that matter most
We get so caught up in the maybes
Just trying to be somebody baby
I was slowly going crazy


Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me
Love is really all we need
Everything else is overrated, overrated


We amputate the heart
Cause we can't let 'em see the broken part
Water down the wine and jump the shark
We build our castles tall
Just so we can have the higher walls
It don't matter where you came from
Or where it is you get your name from
We're going down if we don't change some


Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me
Love is really all we need
Everything else is overrated, overrated


We're all running after something
But if it ain't love it's nothing
It don't matter where you came from
Or where it is you get your name from
We're going down if we don't change some
I'm talking 'bout a ball of flames, son


Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me
Love is really all we need
Everything else is overrated, overrated, yeah

Overrated, overrated, overrated


You say that you’re watching the birds out the window
Well I’ve got a bird you can watch
You ain’t gotta act like you’re borrowing eggs
Just to see if my dishes are washed
And what’s it to you if it’s Wednesday at noon
And I’ve traded my iced tea for scotch


Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer


You ain’t gotta ask what I did to my hair
Or whose underwear’s on the line
They ain’t mine
I ain’t gonna ask who's been mowing your grass
So you ain’t gotta ask who mows mine
Quit judging my job and my car and my clothes
Get your nose out of your mini blinds


Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer


Don’t ask me if I go to church
I won’t ask if your husband is still out of work
Try and claim high society
We get our mail on the same side of the street


Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer


You nosey bitch
There ain’t nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer


I was born in a town full of red pine trees
County sign says "follow your dreams"
Westbound train makes the whole town shake
Friday night lights decide your fate


Born again in a church where the steeple's white
Preacher preach Book of John and my momma cried
Meaning of life was in verse 2
Didn't make sense 'til I found you


I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you


I was a wild child between lost and found
Then you spoke my name, it was a sweet sound
Rescue kiss and you pulled me in
All my life baby, where you been


'Cause I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you


'Cause I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you


You can spend your whole life buildin', somethin' from nothin'
One storm can come and blow it all away, build it anyway
You can chase a dream, that seems so out of reach
And you know it might not ever come your way, dream it anyway


God is great, but sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray, it doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway
I do it anyway


This world's gone crazy and it's hard to believe
That tomorrow will be better than today, believe it anyway
You can love someone with all your heart, for all the right reasons
And in a moment they can choose to walk away, love 'em anyway


God is great, but sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray, it doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway
Yeah, I do it anyway


You can pour your soul out singin', a song you believe in
That tomorrow they’ll forget you ever sang, sing it anyway
Yeah, sing it anyway, yeah yeah
I sing, I dream, I love anyway, yeah

There's a back road leadin' off the hard-top
Half-a-mile past the slingshot tree
Wanders round through a million mem'ries
It's callin' me, callin' me

There's a white house with fading shutters
The old front door that never needed a key
An' I hear my Momma in the hush of the evenin'
Callin' me, yeah, she's callin' me

An' no matter where I'm goin'
It reminds me of where I'm from
Just as long as I can hear it
I know I'm not too far gone

There's a first kiss under the willow
Love so honest, it was hard to believe
An' even when my heart is breakin'
It's callin' me, callin' me

Yes, it's callin' me
(Ooh, yeah, yeah.)
Callin' me, callin' me

An' no matter where I'm goin'
It reminds me of where I'm from
Just as long as I can hear it
I know I'm not too far gone

There's a tiny country chapel
Filled with voices singin' harmony
An' when my soul is lost in the silence
Oh, it's callin'; yes, it's callin' me

Yes it's callin' me
(Callin' me.)
Callin'
Oh, it's callin'
Yes, it's callin' me...


I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, ain’t slowin’ down
I got it real bad, want everything she has
That smile and the midnight laugh she’s givin’ you now


I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then, you’d want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush


I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace
Thinkin’ about her under your bed sheets
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s pullin’ you in
Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get her off my mind


I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then, you’d want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush

I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, it ain’t slowin’ down

You say you love me but you love me not
Something about true love that you must have forgot
To lose a memory I know just where to go
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico

(chorus):
King fish are jumping ' the moon is right
Full throttle captain til the we're out of sight
Stars on the ocean will find me I know
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico

South Padre Island to the Brownsville Bay
My heart is healing with each breaking way
But I got some real friends and they're ready to go
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico

(chorus)
It's gonna take just a little more time
With a little help from the salt and a lime
Something about the wind and the sea sets a broken heart free out there yeah

(chorus)
Somewhere between Texas and Mexico


Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight


Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah


Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list


Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that is not a lot
I have been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight


Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight


Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me


Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I do not mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight


There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly making me want you


And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless


So baby drive slow
'til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it


And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless


Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah


And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless


And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless


Oh oh
Oh yeah


People say I'm just a rough boy
I ain't no good for you girl
It's a dead end street, trying to love me
Yeah, I'll wreck your world
I can see why they're all talking
Looking back at my past
I've got a bad name but a man can change
I'm living proof of that


Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be loving you
All the way up till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be loving you


Baby I might meet all my friends
Shoot the bull, have a beer or two
But you know I'll be the first one to leave
In a hurry to get to you
Somewhere deep inside your angel eyes
I found a place to rest
Don't ever doubt that I'll be around
And baby don't you ever forget




Boy there's a few things you need to know about me
Before you let your sweet heart get in too deep
A white picket fence don't feel like home
Don't wanna rock I need a rolling stone
You wanna hold me
Baby just set me free


I'm a traveling circus train
Spinning weathervane
Going where the wind blows (yeah)
I was born to chase the sun
Some horses gotta run
Yeah, I'm always gonna be
A little bit gypsy


Someday, hey, maybe I'll settle down
But it sure ain't anytime close to now
So much that I might miss you
Sit still for a single minute
I got a life and I'm going to live it
The only way I know how


I'm a traveling circus train
Spinning weathervane
Going where the wind blows (yeah)
I was born to chase the sun
Some horses gotta run
Yeah, I'm always gonna be
A little bit gypsy


I don't know where I'm headed to
I just know I wanna go with you
Do you want to go too?


I'm a traveling circus train
Spinning weathervane
Going where the wind blows (yeah)
I was born to chase the sun
Some horses gotta run
Yeah, I'm always gonna be
A little bit gypsy


A little bit gypsy


You got your hair down
I got this top back
Kissing on my neck
Girl, you got to stop that
Do you want that fast lane?
Or do you want that back seat?
Girl, you got to pick one
You can't expect me
To keep my hands to myself


She ain't into wine and dining
She's shooting whiskey singing Sweet Child of Mine, man
Riding '95 sitting shot gun pretty
Turning this town into paradise city
Running wide ass open
Just as fast as this thing goes, boy
Give me some more
She's my little rock star, man, she knows it
My baby's Guns N' Roses


She's got a wild side
Bet trouble's in her blood
Thinks I'm an outlaw
That's double trouble son
She likes to rock hard
She likes to kiss soft
Hot as a barrel on a 12-gauge sawed off
Ain't hard to please, long as you got speed


She ain't into wine and dining
She's shooting whiskey singing Sweet Child of Mine, man
Riding '95 sitting shot gun pretty
Turning this town into paradise city
Running wide ass open
Just as fast as this thing goes, boy
Give me some more
She's my little rock star, man, she knows it
My baby's Guns N' Roses
Yeah My baby's Guns N' Roses

Yeah, she's dancing with the devil
In the cold November Rain
When she's Knocking On Heaven's Door, son
You can bet God'll call her name


She ain't into wine and dining
She's shooting whiskey singing Sweet Child of Mine, man
Riding '95 sitting shot gun pretty
Turning this town into paradise city
Running wide ass open
Just as fast as this thing goes, boy
Give me some more
She's my little rock star, man, she knows it
My baby's Guns N' Roses
Yeah My baby's Guns N' Roses

Thought that I would never love another
Till the day my eyes saw you
No I yeah I'm feeling like a giddy little kid in a candy store and I
I want more, thinking that you feel it
But I need to be sure

Are you ready for love, do you have enough?
I can take it all can you give it up
Baby are you ready for love?
Are you picking up what I'm throwing down?
Cause if you ain't you better tell me now
Baby are you ready for love?

I'm counting every minute till I get another
Kiss from you, I admit it I'm a little bit afraid but I'm gonna try
Cause this is just so right
Don't waste another moment baby tell me tonight


Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace


Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ our Saviour is born


Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth


Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

Christ the Saviour is born

Well I rolled into town
With the ragtop down
I was looking for that homecoming queen
That three-by-nine lit hotel sign read
Welcome back class of '83
There were football guys twice their size
Cheerleaders hiding the grey in their hair
The names were the same but the faces had changed
I didn't recongize anyone there

That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh, that used to be us

I had a drink with some buds
Played a lot of catch up
Danced with my date from the prom
But as hard as I tried until I closed my eyes
Everybody I knew was gone
There was Mr. Finch, he taught English and French
He was dancing with a couple of canes
And that homecoming queen, yeah the girl of my dreams
She didn't even remember my name

That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us

As I stand here and look around
I can't help but wonder
Who will we be ten years from now

That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh that used to be us
That used to be us
That used to be us


She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the Cracker Jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo
She wants to wear my shirt to bed
She wants to make every stray a pet
And drive around in my truck with no place to go


But she needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She’s everything I want and more
A real desire, that lets her know I’d walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire


She wants a cabin in the woods
She wants to stand where nobody stood
Someday she wants a couple kids of her own
She wants to make love on a train
Some day’s she only wants a break
Hey she wants what she wants, and man I know I know I know




So as long as there’s a breath to take
A smile to share, A prayer to bring
A chance to hold her hand and fan the flame
She’s gonna feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She’s everything I want and more
A real desire, that lets her know I’d walk alone out on the wire
Yeah to make her feel that fire. Whoa
Feel that fire


She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the Cracker Jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo

The biggest lie you ever told
Your deepest fear bout growin' old
The loneliest night you ever spent
The angriest letter you never sent
The girl you swore you'd never leave
The one you kissed on New Year's Eve
The sweetest dream you had last night
Your darkest hour, your hardest fight

I wanna know you (Don: I wanna know you)
Like I know myself
I'm waiting for you (Don: I'm waiting for you)
There ain't no one else

I wanna lose some sleep
I wanna scream and shout
I wanna know you inside out
I wanna take my time
I wanna know you're mine
You know there ain't no doubt
I wanna know you inside out

The saddest song you ever heard
The most you said with just one word
The loneliest prayer you every prayed
The truest vow you ever made
What makes you laugh, what makes you cry
What makes you mad, what gets you by
Your highest high, your lowest low
These are the things I wanna know

Together:
I wanna dig down deep
I wanna lose some sleep
I wanna scream and shout
I wanna know you inside out
I wanna take my time
I wanna know you're mine
You know there ain't no doubt
I wanna know you inside out
I wanna know your soul
I wanna lose control
Come on and let it out
I wanna know you inside out

I wanna dig down deep (Don: dig down deep)
I wanna lose some sleep (Don: I wanna lose some sleep)
I wanna scream and shout
I wanna know you inside out
(Don: I wanna know you inside out)
I wanna take my time (Don: I wanna take my time)

Your deepest fear bout growin' old (oh, yeah)
The loneliest night you ever spent (yeah, eh, yeah)
Inside out
What makes you laugh, what makes you cry
What makes you mad, what gets you by
Inside out...


Look what my heart has gotten into
The sweetest gift I ever knew
It's even better than my favorite shoes
Look what my heart has found in you


Feels like sunshine, fels like rain
Lord it feels like love finally called my name
I wanna jump and shout I wanna sing and dance
Lord it feels like love wants a second chance


Look what my heart can clearly see
How much I crave your company
A true companion I will always be
Look what my heart has done to me




Looks like my heart has become
The safest place for us to run
I'll be here for you when the day is done
Looks like my heart has found someone




That's my favorite part
Rewind my life on
When my world got dark
You turned my light on
I watched it for hours again and again in my head
I did
I see i was down on you more than i needed to be
I'd say i'm sorry but then you'd think i'm lying


Maria, shut up and kiss me
Stop shaking, stand up and hold me
I bet you're gonna miss me
You need me, believe me
Maria shut up and kiss me
You're crazy and it turns me on and on
The way you're carrying on


That's my favorite shirt
You always had on
And it sure looked good
Every time you walked on
You're taking the wind from me every chance that you could
You're good
Something i can't explain
You tell me lately i've changed
If you feel better, tell me why are you crying?


Maria, shut up and kiss me
Stop shaking, stand up and hold me
I bet you're gonna miss me
You need me, believe me
Maria shut up and kiss me
You're crazy and it turns me on and on
The way you're carrying on


Maria, maria can we talk it over instead?
Let's call it even and leave it alone
Come to bed
Maria, stop leaving your teasing is beaten me down
Maria, just calm down
In these situations i've found
It's best not to be proud
And say that you're sorry


Maria, shut up and kiss me
Stop shaking, stand up and hold me
I bet you're gonna miss me
You need me, believe me
Maria shut up and kiss me
You're crazy and it turns me on and on
The way you're carrying on


And it turns me on and on
On and on
On and on
On and on and on and on


I bet my friends are wonderin'
Where I am or if I'm still alive
They're worried over nothin'
They should know I'm perfectly fine
It's just a mood I get in, now and then
When I need to get my head clear
I turn off my phone, get lost, get gone
And flat out disappear


Well, there ain't no tellin' where I'm bound
A big city or the country, a little beach town
But you won't find me 'cause I can't be found
I'm on a mission, to be missin'
I'll be back someday I just don't know when
Till then I'll be a feather floatin' in the wind
So don't you go missin' me
'Cause sometimes missin', is my favorite place to be


I bet the grass is three feet high
And the mailbox is full of bills
A hundred messages I need to check
And when I get the chance I will
But right now I'm busy takin' it easy
Can't worry 'bout stuff like that
My only concern is left or right turn
Somewhere on a map


Well, there ain't no tellin' where I'm bound
A big city or the country, a little beach town
But you won't find me 'cause I can't be found
I'm on a mission, to be missin'
I'll be back someday I just don't know when
Till then I'll be a feather floatin' in the wind
So don't you go missin' me
'Cause sometimes missin', is my favorite place to be


I love those locations where nobody knows my name
How long I'll be stayin' is always subject to change


Well, there ain't no tellin' where I'm bound
A big city or the country, a little beach town
But you won't find me 'cause I can't be found
I'm on a mission, to be missin'
I'll be back someday, I just don't know when
Till then I'll be a feather floatin' in the wind
So don't you go missin' me
'Cause sometimes missin', is my favorite place to be


The moon outside
Too bright
Those blinds, yeah, let's just keep 'em closed, you know
My hands, they know where to go
To find your finger tips
Trace 'em back to your lips
Take you on a trip
Flip that switch


Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black


Like your dress on the floor
Yeah the one you don't need anymore
Black like a sky with no stars
Just find me and fall into my arms


And make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black


I don't wanna see a thing
Baby I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush
I don't wanna see a thing
I just wanna feel your love


Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black


Make my world go black, black
I don't wanna see a thing
(Black, black)
I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush
(Black, black)
(Black, black)

What eyes have put in my head
Wasn't that something that Shakespeare said
Late one night, heart over heels
He was blind in love, well, I know how he feels

Well, I've never been captured by poetry
It always struck me as too flowery
Now I'm love on love torn, lovesick fool
And I've been deep into it
Since I've been in to you

Wanna tell you how it feels
So true, to quote Shakespeare

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Like a golden breeze you got me, blown away
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Thank the wild, wild flowers on the front porch steps

Oh, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet
So wise, so hip, so crazy sweet
So dear, to quote Shakespeare

Look what your love has made of me
I'm bearing my heart on bended knees
And there's no such thing as too much ado
'Cause you're my everything
Yeah, you're my sun and moon

Wanna tell you how I feel
So true, to quote Shakespeare

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Like a golden breeze you got me blown away
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Than the wild, wild flowers on the front porch steps

Oh, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet
So wise, so hip, so crazy sweet
So dear, to quote Shakespeare

I'm feeling words I've never felt before
Need I say more
I finally found the one that I adore
Oh, whoa

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Like a golden breeze you got me blown away
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Than the wild, wild flowers on the front porch steps

Oh, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet
So wise, so hip, so crazy sweet
So dear, to quote Shakespeare


Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer
In the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half
Of your butterfly tattoo


Hey that gives me an idea
Let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park


Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks


I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
Don't worry babe I've got your back
And I've also got your front
Now, I'd hate to waste a night like this
I'll keep you safe you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl
All over you when we get there is me


You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe that ain't what I want


Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks


Ooo, you never know where one might be
Ooo, there's lots of place that are hard to reach
I gotcha


I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you baby way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
I'd sure like to check you for ticks


Back when I was young
Couldn't wait to grow up
Get away and get out on my own
And looking back now
Ain't it funny how
I've been trying to get back home, yea
When my low self esteem
Needs a man loving me
And I find me a perfect catch
Then I see my friends
Having wild weekends
Then I don't wanna get quite so attached
Just as soon as I get what I want
I get unsatisfied
Good is good but could be better


I keep looking, I keep looking for
I keep looking for something more
I always wonder what's on the other side
Of the number two door
I keep looking
Looking for something more


Well, the straight haired girls
They all want curls
And the brunettes wanna be blonde
It's your typical thing
You got ying you want yang
It just goes on and on
They say, hey, it's only human
To never be satisfied
Well I guess that I'm as human as the next one




Just as soon as I get what I want
I get unsatisfied
Hey, good is good but could be better




Girl, well, I don't know what kind of fool he must be
To think that he could leave you alone
And nobody would be taking you home


Girl, I need to talk to you
'Cause I got a question, it's more like a suggestion
And here's the deal
If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
Like you've never been loved before
Up against the wall when you walk in the door
Looking like you wanna leave, you want some more
If he ain't gonna love you, I will


Girl, well, it's obvious that something ain't right
Or else you wouldn't be here tonight
And I don't wanna come on too strong
Don't get me wrong


Girl, I need to talk to you
'Cause I got a question, see, it's more like a suggestion
And here's the deal
If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
Like you've never been loved before
Up against the wall when you walk in the door
Looking like you wanna leave, you want some more
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
Oh, girl, I will


If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you


Girl, I need to talk to you
'Cause I got a question, see, it's more like a suggestion
And here's the deal
If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
Like you've never been loved before
Up against the wall when you walk in the door
Looking like you wanna leave, you want some more
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
Give you something you can hold onto
Never gonna stop 'til the whole night's through
Love you like a lover is supposed to do
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
I will, oh, girl, I will
If he ain't gonna love you, I will

You're no ordinary date
You're like a sunbeam in the rain:
So wonderfully out of place
You're a detour off the map
You match clothes that shouldn't match
An' you sell it all with your style
An' it makes me smile

And I can see a world I never knew
(World I never knew)
I'm finding a deeper blue
Sparkling in your eyes
Yeah, I just come alive
And I'm intrigued by your every move
(By your every move)
The things only you would do
The things you don't see; you say it's just me:
That's so you

You're blessed with luck I can't explain:
You bet a horse 'cause you liked it's name
And man if it didn't win
Your new tattoo says: "Love rules"
You're like Haggard an' Jones and Jude
You say life is all about trust
An' you say that's us

And I can see a world I never knew
(World I never knew)
I'm finding a deeper blue
Sparkling in your eyes
Yeah, I just come alive
And I'm intrigued by your every move
(By your every move)
The things only you would do
The things you don't see; you say it's just me:
That's so you

You're more than fascination
(More than fascination)
My imagination could ever dream

And I can see a world I never knew
(World I never knew)
I'm finding a deeper blue
Sparkling in your eyes
Yeah, I just come alive
And I'm intrigued by your every move
(By your every move)
The things only you would do
The things you don't see; you say it's just me:
That's so you

Baby, that's so you
Yeah, that's so you
That's so you

What I should do is play it cool
In front of you and I just might
Fool ya for a minute or two

But what I can't hide
Is everything I feel inside
Cause the truth is baby my heart
Starts racin when I'm next to you

(Chorus) And Love won't let me
Not go crazy when you come around
Go insane when we get a little closer now
I'd be inclined to chicken out, but love won't let me
Love has a funny way of gettin you in
Somethin that scares you but you can't resist
I'd let you leave without a kiss, but love won't let me

So I took that step, now I'm over my head
And now I'm circling earth and I'm pretty sure
I won't be comin down for awhile

But the trouble is ever since that little kiss
I don't care how late it gets
Don't wanna let you out of these arms of mine

(chorus)
Now I, I only wanna spend my time
Holdin you tight, every night
Baby everytime I think about us
I've loved you from the day we met
The way you get me
I'm so glad that love wouldn't let me

Not go crazy when you come around
Go insane when we get a little closer now
I'd be inclined to chicken out, but love won't let me
Love has a funny way of gettin you in
Somethin that scares you but you can't resist
I'd let you leave without a kiss, but love won't let me
No, No Love won't let me


If I had a weakness
You sure found it tonight
Some hidden desperation
You saw floatin' in my eyes
Moments just like these baby
Wrong can feel so right
And I don't wanna go home tonight
I've held it all together
As long as I can
There's pieces of me fallin'
Right into your hands
And don't the lies come easy baby
When the truth just ain't worth the fight
No I, I don't wanna go home tonight


So lay me down easy
And hold on tight
And tell me I'm the only one you see tonight
Lonely woman, lonely man
There's just some things only lonely understands


I might be just a sinner
Who wants to be a saint
One justifies the reason
Oh, one understands the pain
And I don't know what's wrong baby
And I sure don't know what's right
But I don't wanna go home tonight



(Verse 1)
I used to believe that things would change but here we go again
Riding and spinning carousale this circle never ends
This kitchen table has seen it all before
These walls are tired of standing...Can't hold us anymore

**Chorus**
One Mississippi I close my eyes
Two Mississippi Im beggin' you and we can still survive
Three Mississippi No looking back
Gone for good and i know that
I won't Change my mind...OoOh WooOa yea
Three Mississippi is where I at tonight

(Verse 2)
We're all out of second chances and all out of one more times
Theres not a word we haven't said nothing we have not tried
My bones are aching from the weight im holding down
I took all that im taking
Im breaking....breaking down

**Chorus**
One Mississippi I close my eyes
Two Mississippi Im beggin' you and we can still survive
Three Mississippi No looking back
Gone for good and i know that
I won't Change my mind...OoOh WooOa yea
Three Mississippi is where I at tonight

(Bridge)
Hold My breath, Close My Eyes...
...Goodbye...
WooOOOo WoOooOO

**Chorus**
One Mississippi I close my eyes
Two Mississippi Im beggin' you and we can still survive
Three Mississippi No looking back
Gone for good and i know that
I won't Change my mind...No I Won't Change My Mind
Three Mississippi is where I at tonight

Three Mississippi
Three Mississippi

Lock up your husbands
Lock up your sons
Lock up your whiskey cabinets
Girls lock up your guns
Lock up the beauty shop
No telling if they've heard the news
Call the boys downtown at Neiman Marcus
Tell 'em lock up them high-heeled shoes

When God Fearin' Women Get The Blues
There ain't no slap dab atellin' what they're gonna do
Run around yellin' "I gotta Mustang
It'll do eighty
You don't have to be my baby
I've stirred my last batch of gravy
You don't have to be my baby"

Call all the deacons
Call the ladies' aid
Call all the altos, sopranos, tenors, call every bass
Well, call all the Pentecostals
And bring that anointing oil too
Well call the preacher
He's the only one can reach her
And there ain't no time to lose

When God Fearin' Women Get The Blues
There ain't no slap dab atellin' what they're gonna do
Run around yellin' "I gotta Mustang
It'll do eighty
You don't have to be my baby
I've stirred my last batch of gravy
You don't have to be my baby"

She's on all our prayer lists
She's on all our hearts
As for the Easter cantata
We don't know who'll sing her part

When God Fearin' Women Get The Blues
There ain't no slap dab atellin' what they're gonna do
Run around yellin' "I gotta Mustang
It'll do eighty
You don't have to be my baby
I've stirred my last batch of gravy
You don't have to be my baby"

Little hula girls on the shot glass
All we need's a little salt & lime
We can plug in the hot pepper lights and pretend
That we're livin' on Key West time
I can run to the store and get some charcoal
Buy a tiki torch and fire up the grill
The whole town wants to know when I'm gonna grow up
But you know I never will

Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright

Nothin' wrong with a little excitement
No it makes me forget about work
'Cause I live by the rule that everything's cool
Just as long as nobody gets hurt
Hey I feel like I'm on vacation
Honey you say the word and we'll go
'Cause you're getting to me
In those cut off jeans
And that T-shirt from Sloppy Joes

Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright
Yeah the deep end might be so close
Oh that I'm hangin' on for dear life
Yeah I might be a little bit loco baby
But a little bit crazy's alright
(That's right)

Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright
Yeah the deep end might be so close
Oh that I'm hangin' on for dear life
Yeah I might be a little bit loco baby
But a little bit crazy's alright

Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Well I might be a little bit loco
Baby but a little bit crazy's alright
Get crazy alright
Might be a little bit loco
But a little bit crazy's alright


There was a time
I really used to care about what others thought
And the way they talk
In a crowd
I used to pull away when she would kiss my face
And touch my hair
She didn't care who saw


She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that I love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me


The sky is blue
But from where I stand in the middle of this heartache
It sure looks gray
All alone
What I wouldn't give if I could feel
The familiar touch of her love holding me again


She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that I love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that I love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me

Hey Love No Fair
You don't play by the rules
Sometimes I wonder if you care
You kick me when I'm down
And left my heart up in the air
Hey Love No Fair

Why must you remain a mystery
I still don't have a clue
If I hold a winning hand
Should I bid on you again
Knowing well that there's a chance
That I could lose

Hey Love No Fair
You don't play by the rules
Sometimes I wonder if you care
You kick me when I'm down
And left my heart up in the air
Hey Love No Fair

Whats with all these strange emotions
Moving me this way
I just got used to solitude
Suddenly you're standing there
I don't know if I dare
To get back in this game

Hey Love No Fair
You don't play by the rules
Sometimes I wonder if you care
You kick me when I'm down
And left my heart up in the air
Hey Love No Fair

You were hidin'
While I was seekin'
Now you're creeping into my heart
(Haw)

Hey Love No Fair
You don't play by the rules
Sometimes I wonder if you care
You kick me when I'm down
And left my heart up in the air
Hey Love No Fair


I got miles of trouble spreading far and wide
Bills on the table getting higher and higher
They just keep on coming, there ain't no end in sight
I'm just holding on tight
I've got someone who loves me more then words can say
And I'm thankful for that each and every day
And if I count all my blessings, I get a smile on my face
Still it's hard to find faith


But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me believe


It's just day to day trying to make ends meet
What I'd give for an address out on easy street
I need a deep margarita to help me unwind
Leave my troubles behind




I used to believe in us
When times got tough
But lately I'm afraid that even love is not enough




I see main street closing
Miles of “for sale” signs
And them fields ain’t growing
Fast enough to get us by
I feel the sweet release
Of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry


Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back


So grab the girl you came with
And set her world on fire
And watch her sway and singing to the music
Until it’s all alright
Yeah


Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back


I don’t wanna lose this feeling
And I don’t wanna close my eyes
I don’t wanna remember what I’m here to forget tonight
So tip it on back


Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back


Yeah, I don’t wanna lose this feeling
I don’t wanna close my eyes
I don’t wanna remember what i’m here to forget tonight
So tip it on back
Just tip it on back


Feel the sweet release of a friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry
Tip it on back

I spent years and all this time
Thinking I was better off
'Cuz you were mine
You always said
It was your way or the highway

So I'm shifting my life into drive
I'm getting out
Kissing the past good-bye
Like Toby said
"How do you like me now?"
This conversation has run dry
And I keep telling myself

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
There's more to me than you
Ooooooo, ooooooo
Don't underestimate what I can do

Well, I'm alright
It's okay
I know I'll make it through
'Cuz there's more to me than you

I'm not saying
I'm battered and bruised
But I might as well be with the words you used
I believe in myself
That makes me stronger
Things changed
And so have I

I'm gonna make hay while the sun still shines
You can clip my wings
But I'm still gonna fly
I'm on my own and on my way
And I keep telling myself

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
There's more to me than you
Ooooooo, ooooooo
Don't underestimate what I can do

Well, I'm alright
It's okay
I know I'll make it through
'Cuz there's more to me than you

There was always something
That meant more to you than me
And I'm just sorry
It's taking this for you to see

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
There's more to me than you
Ooooooo, ooooooo
Don't underestimate what I can do

Well, I'm alright
It's okay
I know I'll make it through
'Cuz there's more to me than you

Ooooooooo, ooooooo, oooooo
There's more to me than you

There's more to me than you

Passing through Memphis one night in May
Saw her waiting tables at a Beal Street Blues Cafe
The band was playing strong but she was center stage

Straight from the Delta, off to see the world
This was the big time for a Mississippi girl
Who had a hard life but she’s a Southern pearl

Something about her took my breath away
Her love it hit me like a hurricane

And she’s like
Joy riding in a 57 Coup
She’s like two-stepping in my favorite pair of boots
She’s sky diving in with out a parachute
And girl I’m falling, I’m falling into you

We got to dancing, drinking all night long
She said don’t quit on me now boy won't you come along
And we went down by the river, skinny-dipping till the dawn

Spent the morning fishing fried them up by noon
Spent the evening kissing near the Southern moon

And it’s like
Joy riding in a 57 Coup
She’s like two-stepping in my favorite pair of boots
She’s sky diving in with out a parachute
And girl I’m falling, I’m falling into you

Joy riding in a 57 Coup
She’s like two-stepping in my favorite pair of boots
She’s sky diving in with out a parachute
And girl I’m falling, I’m falling into you

Miss Laura fed the hungry in the church house basement
After she retired from teaching school
She'd pick my son up in her arms on Sundays
To teach him all about the golden rule
I heard those stories about Selma and Tuskeegee
How she helped Martin fill the jail
All I know is she had the strength of te grown men
Even though her hands were small and frail

She was an everyday angel, the kind without wings
Walking around in the world, just like you and me
Angel, living out love
The kind of people we could us a lot more of
Just an everyday angel, everyday angel

Marilyn was waiting outside my old man's office
Trying to hide the bruises on her face
He said, "You don't have to get knocked around anymore"
"You can come and live at our place"
I didn't know till I had kids of my own
But I learn a big lesson that day
What you do means a whole lot more
Then anything you have to say

Go be an everyday angel, the kind without wings
Walking round in this world, just like you and me
Angel, living out love
The kind of people we could use a lot more of
An everyday angel, everyday angel

Dave was gonna meet his wife at a coffee shop in Brooklyn
When he heard the alarm sing out
911, he was running up the stairs then he never got back down
Down, down

He was an everyday angel, earnin' his wings
Trying to save people who are just like you and me
Angel, living out love
The kind of people we could use a lot more of
An everyday angel, everyday angel
Everyday angel, everyday angel

Everyday angel

They said you ain't got a prayer, a chance in you-know-where
But I just didn't care, when I looked in your eyes
You were a long-shot from the start, an easy way to break my heart
But as perfect as you are' you gotta risk it all sometimes

I believe in the underdog
Who chases dreams and breaks down walls
The shy kid who gets the prom queen
Who's never been the star of anything
And those two lovers hitched at city hall
They've got each other, so they've got it all
Call me a dreamer, say I'm a little naive
Oh, but I believe in the underdog

We bought a 4-room fixer up, on the side of town where times are tough
Short on cash, but long on love, yeah, we sure showed it
Then you gave me our little man, so small he fit inside my hands
Two months early, two pounds, the tallest kid in third grade now

Yeah, I believe in the underdog
Who chases dreams and breaks down walls
The shy kid who gets the prom queen
Who's never been the star of anything
And those two lovers hitched at city hall
They've got each other, so they've got it all
Call me a dreamer, say I'm a little naive
Oh, but I believe in the underdog

The bank's still breathin' down our necks
We're still living check to check
Girl, we dig deeper everyday
We still hit our knees and pray
We pray, we pray'

I believe in the underdog
Who chases dreams and breaks down walls
A guy like me could get the prom queen
I've never been the star of anything
We were two lovers hitched at city hall
We still got each other, so we got it all
Call me a dreamer, say I'm a little naive
Yeah you can call me a dreamer, say I'm a little naive
Oh, but I believe in the underdog
Oh, in the underdog
I believe'
Yeah, in the underdog'
I believe'
Oh, in the underdog

Missing Years
By Little Texas

Bet you never thought you'd see me, round these parts again
Cause five minutes after graduation I blew out of here like the wind
Was the first one in four generations to think that there had to be something more
And whatever I was missing, it damn sure worth looking for
So I hit the road, long and lonesome road

I got lost in Arizona, trying to find my place in the sun
Met a girl in Oklahoma, turns out she was not the one
Made my way to the Carolina's, wondered up and down the coast
Till it dawned on me, what I'd left right here
And what I'd been missing, in my missing years

It's the smell of the morning coffee, at the Liberty Cafe
Smile and in a way from old Sunny, like I hadn't missed a day
Well it sure ain't much to look at, just a dusty drive through town
But the roots that run beneath it, are what make it scared ground
I've seen enough to know, what make a place a home

Cause I got lost in Arizona, trying to find my place in the sun
Met a girl in Oklahoma, turns out she was not the one
Made my way to the Carolina's, wondered up and down the coast
Till it dawned on me, what I'd left right here
And what I'd been missing, in my missing years

Made my way from the Carolina's, to this one lane gravel road
Cause it dawned on me, what I left right here


We were golden, we were fire, we were magic
Yeah, and they all knew our names all over town
We had it made in the middle of the madness
We were neon in a grey crowd
Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn’t do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history


Yeah, we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we’d never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I’ll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they’ll remember
We were legends


Like we were written down in permanent marker
Not even the brightest sun could ever fade
Come whichever, Hell or high water
It was always me and you either way
Hey, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn’t do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me


And that’s why we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we’d never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I’ll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they’ll remember
We were legends
Oh, woah


We were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we’d never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember baby?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they’ll remember
We were legends
We were
Yeah, we were legends
Yeah, we wrote our own story

Ripped shirt, suntan
And a camel baseball cap
Doors off, aviators on

A faded pair of blue jeans
He's got a smile like I've never seen
Speakers rocking to a country song

I'm sorry, girls but I just can't stay
Got some better things to do today
He just called and said he's on his way

Beep, beep
Here comes my baby in his jeep, jeep
He drives me crazy, bouncing up and down
All around town in his bucket seat, seat

He wants to take me on a back road
I'll go anywhere he wants to go, go
Tough and sexy that's how he rolls
In his jeep, jeep

Some night go by the river
And run it through some shallow water
I ain't scared of getting wet

And later on if I'm lucky
He'll take me back where the field gets muddy
And getting stuck is a good bet

He likes going where he ain't allowed
Good times is what he's all about
What's that? I think I hear him now

Beep, beep
Here comes my baby in his jeep, jeep
He drives me crazy, bouncing up and down
All around town in his bucket seat, seat

He wants to take me on a back road
I'll go anywhere he wants to go, go
Tough and sexy that's how he rolls
In his jeep, jeep

He don't do nothing by the book
Don't know how far he's off the hook
Just look that's all it took

Beep, beep
Here comes my baby in his jeep, jeep
He drives me crazy, bouncing up and down
All around town in his bucket seat, seat

He wants to take me on a back road
I'll go anywhere he wants to go, go
Tough and sexy that's how he rolls
In his jeep, jeep


I saw a garage sale, pulled up in the yard
Found a statue of Jesus, it was eight feet tall
He held out His arms, and He seemed all alone
So I loaded Him up, and I drove Him home


Out by my driveway, He looks down the street
Long hair and sandals made of rebar and concrete
I painted Him white with a long purple robe
He's a Rock of Ages on our gravel road


He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
Standing taller than a tree
He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
A bigger man than you or me


I thought losing my job was the end of the world
'Til my best pal ran off with my best girl
I felt suicidal with no real friends
So I walked outside with a rope in my hand


Out by the statue there's a big old tree
So I stood on His shoulders and I counted to three
I had every intention of buying the farm
But when I jumped off, He caught me in His arms


He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
Standing taller than a tree
He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
A bigger man than you or me


I wanted to return the favor to Him
'Cause I never had a more solid friend
So I planted some flowers all around His feet
And I bought Him a flock of ceramic sheep


He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
Standing taller than a tree
He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
A bigger man than you or me


He's a bigger man than you or me
Yeah

I've been driving and I've been thinking
For at least a hundred miles
And I'm seeing a lot of things I never saw before
For the first time leaving you doesn't feel quite so wrong
But then again I've never been this far gone

Well I was running flat on empty
Running scared for quite some time
So afraid of what I might do if I stopped ,oh yeah
But I did and I can't believe
I'm back on the highway and not on the phone

But then again I've never been this far gone

All the other times my heart turned me around
But this time I'm not going back
I'm way past that point now

You know I never really thought
I could make it on my own
But then again I've never been this far gone
Oh then again I've never been this far gone

Seeger was singing words I could believe in
Main Street was my street at night
So I called on Samantha and asked her the chance
Of us running out 'neath the moonlight

Well, she's not with me now, she can always be found
When I rewind the radio dial
And like it was then I feel her on my skin
And I'm back there for a while

So I labor for hours cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pouring my soul into stories of life
Hoping someone will hear one tonight

And maybe my own voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams

My eighteenth summer, I was a cocky up-and-comer
Cranking up Born to Run
Turned left out the drive with the pistons open wide
And I came back a prodigal son

My spirit was broken, she threw the door open
I love you, not I told you so
When I hear Mama Tried, I still break down and cry
And pull to the side of the road

And I labor for hours cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pouring my soul into stories of life
Hoping someone will hear one tonight

And maybe my own voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams

So I labor for hours cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pouring my soul into stories of life
Hoping someone will hear one tonight

Maybe my own voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams
The sound of a million dreams

Ella es la mujer mas bella conquista a cualquiera su cara bonita
No te fies de su belleza una rosa tierna tambien tiene espinas
Es callejon sin salida una yena herida experta en venganza
Cuando menos lo imaginas destruira tu vida es Mujer De Doble Cara

Ella es un caso perdido si tu ya has caido cuanto lo lamento
Los hombres se los come vivos es el paraiso o el mismo infierno
Es ladrona de ilusiones deja que te enamores y despues te usa
Es la amante de una noche la bala de un revolver en una ruleta rusa

Es sensual y vanidosa de armas y rosas es trampa mortal
Es la mas linda de todas hiedra venenosa que no deja escapar
Me ama aunque no me lo diga ojos de asesina como navaja
Es verdad y es mentira yo se que es mia aunque duerma en otra cama

Ella es agua entre las manos otro del bocado que nadie domo
Una virgen del rosario cruz de tu calvario muerte y resurrecion
Es la adiccion que te enferma el vicio que no dejas aunque te hace mal
En el engaño es maestra una viuda negra que dormido te puede matar

Que no te enamore su rostro si miras sus ojos te robara el alma
Por ella lo dejaras todo si te vuelves loco te deja sin nada
Es el vicio mas extremo el ardiente fuego tentacion fatal
Droga que le tira el cuerpo pasion y deseo la manzana que comio adan

Ella es un angel sin alas te miente en la cara y te deja contento
Es mujer de doble cara puede ser la mala o la buena del cuento
Es una dama del diablo sus besos son caros como la ceda
Tienes que andar con cuidado si eres atrapado seras otra de sus presas

Yeah, this is your love song baby
This is the part where I must confess
You're looking good in that pretty dress
Consider this fair warning
It's getting kinda hard to say goodnight
Underneath the porch light

Now I'm not saying it sink or swim
Yeah, but I've already jumped in

'Cause tonight's not the night
To play it safe or take it easy
Or waste anymore precious time
No, tonight's not the night
To watch you get in your car and leave me
No, tonight's not the night for goodbye

Sometimes it's not easy
Sometimes love can scare you half to death
But I'll give it my best
Yeah, we'll find a way to make it
Who says we've got to do it their way
Baby what do you say?

'Cause tonight's not the night
To play it safe or take it easy
Or waste anymore precious time
No, tonight's not the night
To watch you get in your car and leave me
No, tonight's not the night for goodbye

Now it's a long way home
Yeah, you got no reason to go
Why don't you stay, stay?

No, tonight's not the night
To watch you get in your car and leave me
No, tonight's not the night for goodbye
No, tonight's not the night for goodbye

No, tonight's not the night
Yeah, the night for goodbye
Yeah, tonight's not the night
Yeah, the night for goodbye
Yeah, the night for goodbye

My breath is short, my heart is beating fast
Every time I smile at her she's smiling back
If I'm dreaming, please just let me sleep
Anyone can see that she's too good for me
Oh, give her time, she'll find out soon enough
Just let me have and hold her 'til she does

What we've got going on is so incredible
This chemistry between us feels so wonderful
But knowing me, I'll probably
Find a way to mess it up
Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love

Don't concern me with reality
Don't convince me she's too heavenly
Forget the future, disregard the past
Those are questions I don't want to ask
To my heart, all that matters is tonight
Just let me live this moment in her eyes

What we've got going on is so incredible
This chemistry between us feels so wonderful
But knowing me, I'll probably
Find a way to mess it up
Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love

What we've got going on is so incredible
This chemistry between us feels so wonderful
But knowing me, I'll probably
Find a way to mess it up
Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love

Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love
Let me be in love
I just want to be in love


Girl I really did mean it when I wished you the best
Good to hear you're killing it way out west
Finding your own way didn't take too long
Baby rock on, rock on


It's getting tough keeping up with where you are
Posting pics like some big Hollywood star
Guess every club in town is playing your song
Baby rock on, rock on


Rock on like you don't miss me
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til you forget me, just like you said you would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on


Yeah, I do a lotta thinking about wanting you back
But I don't know about all dolled up like that
If my homegrown country girl's long gone
Then baby rock on, rock on


Rock on like you don't miss me
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til you forget me, just like you said you would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on
Yeah, rock on


I saw your hashtag, digging on some new dude
Girl, you left me with nothing else to do


Rock on like I don't miss you
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til I forget you, just like I wish I would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on


Baby rock on
Yeah, I should've put a rock on
Yeah, baby rock on
Yeah, I really did mean it when I wished you the best


Maybe I should take that picture off the dashboard
Before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
Yeah, I bet she's still crying on that front porch
Yeah, this time it's gonna take some time to heal


'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
There's more than miles in my rear view


Well, I'm headed north to what I swore I wanted
And trying not to buy into my doubts
But I just can't seem to keep myself from wondering
Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south


'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
There's more than miles in my rear view


Yeah, more than miles
Yeah, I've been changing lanes without my mirrors
Cause every time I look behind me I see her
I think I just realized how much I need her


So I’m turning back for Georgia
Stopping short of Tennessee
I can’t put my dreams before her
Man, I need her with me
Cause that girl’s in every song I sing
She’s in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Can sleep in the back tonight
Now I know what I’m supposed to do, yeah
There’s still more than miles in my rear view


More than miles, yeah
More than miles


Well I'm crazy about fast cars, football and guitars
All them old country songs Daddy used to play
I'm crazy about Friday nights, cold beer and good times
Crazy about a summer day out on the lake


But I'm ten times crazier without about your love, girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you


Well I'm all about a weekend, kicking with my good friends
Every now and then I like to make a little noise
But don't you go thinking' that I won't leave them hanging
Cause even though I'm crazy about them good old boys


I'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you


I know you love me girl that's easy to see
But as crazy as you say you are about me


I'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

I'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you


I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m OK
But that’s not what gets me


What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin’ to do


It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Getting up, getting dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken


What hurts the most
Is being so close
And having so much to say much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do, oh




What hurts the most
Is being so close
And having so much to say (much to say)
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do, oh


Not seeing that loving you
That’s what I was trying to do

(Sam Hogin/Bob Regan/Steve Wariner)

Girl I'm not a saint and I'm a long long way from perfect
And I'm a hand full of trouble but I 'd like to think I'm worth it
Yeah I know I drive you crazy I'm hyper and I'm lazy
But admit it girl you love me like I am

Chorus
I'm your man I'm your boy
I'll give you grief I'll bring you joy
I'll be right there when you want me
Even sometimes when you don't
I'll be your hero with a halo
Be your zero or your scapegoat
I got the goods I got the stuff I got the plan
I'm your man

When you tell me jump I'll ask how high baby
You say absolutely positively I say maybe
When you cry I'll just hold you
And I'll never say I told you
You know it's my pleasure it's my job

Chorus
I'll set you straight when you stumble
Sing your praises keep you humble
And do the things that no one else can do

Chorus


I knew the first time should've been the last time
I ever let the whiskey touch my lips
Cause the devil wears black and he goes by Jack
And he's really good at helpin' me forget

I thought it was cool when I was a kid
Walkin' around with that cigarette lit
On that ol' dirt road, I lit my first smoke
And I knew right then it wouldn't let me go


And it's all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Ain't no stopping, keep on rocking, yeah
It seems I'm always
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put, can't put, can't put down


She looked my way then looked back again
Gotta different kinda high when I touched her skin
When she laid it on me, she rocked my world
I knew I'd never get away from that girl


And it's all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Ain't no stopping, keep on rocking, yeah
It seems I'm always
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put, can't put, can't put down


When I walked into my first smoky bar
Cranked up the amp and played this guitar
Had 'em singing along by the end of the night
And I knew I finally got one thing right


And it's all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Ain't no stopping, keep on rocking, yeah
It seems I'm always
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put, can't put, can't put down
Yeah, yeah, I wanna put it down

That hurts
Your baby told you it was over
And I'm just a friendly shoulder you can cry on
While I ache to take you into my arms
Of all the dreams in all the world
There's nothing worse
Than meant to be and you don't see

CHORUS:
That I wanted to be the one to make your knees weak
Your hands shake
I wanted to be the one that you woke up to
Held on to
But I never knew that touch
And you'll never know how much
That hurts

It's not fair
I have to be the great pretender
As if I don't remember all those sad prayers
That sounded good but got me nowhere
Of all the jokes in all the world
How sad is this
To be so close and not let show

CHORUS

Oh I wanted to be the one to make your knees weak
Your hands shake
I wanted to be the one that you woke up to
Held on to
But I never knew that touch
And you'll never know how much that hurts

Why she had to look so beautiful
Why she had to pick this place?
I hope she brought and explanation
I hope she doesn't look my way

Cause it would be hard to say hello to her
When she never said goodbye
It would take every bit of... I've gained to knock it lost
In those eyes

Oh but I can't take another gone like that
Take another hurt so bad that
I can't breathe, I can't sleep, don't wanna eat
And I won't take another way she go in
Take another all alone
Man I want her back, but I can't take another gone like that
I can't take another gone like that, no

She came up on me like a flood
She wiped out everything I knew
Now just barely... water, last thing I need to do
As a reach for you
Oh but I can't take another gone like that

Can't take another hurt so bad that

I can't breathe, I can't sleep, don't wanna eat
And I won't take another way she go in
Take another all alone
Man I want her back, but I can't take another gone like that
I can't take another gone like that, no

Now she's walking my direction, I might be lonely
And this is tempting
Oh now I can't take another gone like that
Can't take another hurt so bad that
I can't breathe, I can't sleep, I can't even eat
And I won't take another way she go in
Take another all alone
Man I want her back, but I can't take another gone
Yes some times I want her back
But I can't take another gone like that
No, I can't take another gone like that
I can't take another gone, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no yeah, yeah, wo whooo

I can't believe you'd do that to me
Use me
You've fooled around and a'wrecked my heart
She's just a skank rode hard and put up
Well, good luck

I would've given you the finger on my left hand
The one that you use for a wedding band

(But) (And) now I'm givin' you
The one in the middle
The one that's a little bit longer
And I got another one
On my other hand
So I can say it even stronger
If you're askin' if I'm done
Well, I'm sure not sayin' you're number one
(No, now I'm givin' you)
(The one in the middle)
(The one that says we're through)

I hope you're happy with your sad life
That's right
I hope you get what you deserve
And when you're tired of TV dinners
Remember

I would've given you the finger on my left hand
The one that you use for a wedding band

(But) (And) now I'm givin' you
The one in the middle
The one that's a little bit longer
And I got another one
On my other hand
So I can say it even stronger
If you're askin' if I'm done
Well, I'm sure not sayin' you're number one
(No, now I'm givin' you)
(The one in the middle)
(The one that says we're through)

Well, you made your bed
So go lay in it
And you forced my heart and hands
To the limit

Ah, yeah, I've had it with you, darlin'
That's right

(But) (And) now I'm givin' you
The one in the middle
The one that's a little bit longer
And I got another one
On my other hand
So I can say it even stronger
If you're askin' if I'm done
Well, I'm sure not sayin' you're number one
(No, now I'm givin' you)
(The one in the middle)
(The one that says we're through)

Oh, yeah, read between the lines, baby


Drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight


Got a Tennessee girl, a Rocky Top breeze
And a big ol' yellow moon
A new set of strings on my '69
And a Yeti full of iced-down booze
Everybody 'round this sleepy little town
Heading down Pinetucky Road
Gonna leave our worries in a cloud of dust
Right there by the old fence post


Yeah, we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight


Got a pig in the ground, stars in the sky
And a jar full of lightning juice
Got a worn-out path to the river bank
Everybody coming out of them boots
Gonna pick a few songs all night long
Ones that we grew up on
Some fishing in the dark, some Copperhead Road
Everybody just sing along


Gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight


Yeah, we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
Yeah, we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight


Drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
That's right


Ah, come on boys, whoo
This is so weird having my dad on a song right now
Considering he's 50
Uh, 47
I think he's gonna make a comeback album and this is the start of it
I taught you everything you know, son
But not everything I know
We through playing now


She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...


He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, "I'll love her 'til I die"
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby


La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa


The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night...


She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby


La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

Who is the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in a field near the big old highway
Rollin' down the highway in my Jimmy, haulin' freight
From Chicago to St Louis, Lord, I see her every day
Oh, a double clutchin' weasel like me can hardly ever get
A girl to look at him that way
Smilin' like the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Wow, what a girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I bet it wouldn't take her very long to be gone
If someone would pull a dirty trick, take her towel away
I'd slow my Jimmy to 20
That's how many wrecks I see there every day
Caused by the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Oh, I love the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
And I guess I'm gettin' bolder 'cause I'd rather kiss and hold her
Than just keep lookin' at her every day
At 4:45, coffee-drinkin', eatin' time
Jimmy shimmied, while I woke up the artist that painted the display
Of the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

All right

---- Instrumenta Interlude ----

Doggone, that girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Sleepy headed, painter said the girl wasn't real and I better get on my way
On Route 66 from the billboard to Chicago
You'll find tiny pieces of my heart scattered every which a-way
Shattered by the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Who was the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Who is the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Who is the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Well, who is the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Yeah, who is the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Yeah


A gun goes off in a far off city
A siren wails right here at home
Well sometimes life ain't all that pretty
When you're watching it all alone


You build a wall around your feelings
Just another heart afraid to break
And you don't wanna let me in cause really
What difference can I make?


I can't change the world
Baby, that's for sure
But if you let me, girl
I can change yours
I bet I can change yours


So let Jesus look down on this mess
And let the powers that be just fuss and fight
Cause everyone needs to pick their battles and
We all realize


That I can't change the world
Baby, that's for sure
But if you let me, girl
I can change yours
I bet I can change yours


And every time you light a flame
You just get burned and you feel like
It's all in vain
You feel like
You need to learn that no one's gonna save you
No, no one's gonna save you
But I'm standing here
My heart's on my sleeve
Never gonna let you down
Never ever gonna leave you


Baby, that's for sure
Oh I can't change the world
But I can change yours
I bet I can change
Yours


I get this feeling that I can’t explain
Every time I see your face or hear your name
I just go crazy
Thinking baby this may be my chance
What would you say to me
If I said baby let’s lay down and dance?


I got to tell you girl, you drive me wild
Every time I see you dance I see that smile
My world gets hazy
And I’m moving like I’m in a trance
Whoa, I know it’s crazy
But baby let’s lay down and dance


When it comes to love
My heart is black and it’s blue
Swore I was through with romance
But girl you’re something
And I'm counting on you
You’re my brand new second chance


My friends all tell me that I’m not your kind
They say I better pray your love is blind
You got to save me
I’m a victim of your circumstance
Whoa, I know it’s crazy
But baby let’s lay down and dance


When it comes to love
My heart is black and it’s blue
Thought I was through with romance
But girl you’re something
And I have nothing to lose
You’re my brand new second chance


I got to tell you girl you drive me wild
I’ve never known no one with quite your style
I’m going crazy
Thinking baby this may be my chance
What would you say to me
If I said baby let’s lay down and dance?
Girl, I know it’s crazy
But baby let’s lay down and dance


I got a piece of land out in the countryside
Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine
Feels so good to be taking it easy
Why would I ever leave? Cause I know


I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Homegrown


We got a fire going down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle, living like we'll never die
Come on and stay a while if you don't believe me
Why would I ever leave, cause I know


I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Homegrown
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need
Homegrown
And nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need
Homegrown
And nothing I don't
Homegrown


It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
Weight you carry
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want


I've got everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Oh, everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown


I wasted so much time believing
That in this life
You'd try and get all you can take
But all along what I've been needing
Was to find just one good reason
To give myself really give myself away


Every smile that lights my face
Every teardrop every trace
Every secret hidden place
Belongs to you
Anything that's good in me all I ever hope to be
Every drop of every dream belongs to you


You know the me that I remember always thought you had to keep it all inside
Getting trouble being tender
So you never say surrender
It took you finally prove me wrong




I'm letting go
I'm letting go now
But everything I ever held on to
Every place I've ever been
Every chance I'll get again
Every secret every sin belongs to you
Anything that's good in me
All I ever hope to be
Every drop of every dream belongs to you
It all belongs to you


Got the news on Friday morning
But a tear I couldn't find
You showed me how I am supposed to live
Now you showed me how to die
I was lost til Sunday morning
I woke up to face my fear
While writing you this good bye song I found a tear


I'm going to miss that smile
I'm going to miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
Id do it all again

So play it sweet in heaven
Cause that's right where you want to be
I'm not crying' cause I feel so sorry for you
I am crying' for me


I got up and dialed your number
Your voice came on the line
That old familiar message
I have heard a thousand times
It just said, sorry that I missed you
Leave a message and god bless
I know that you think I am crazy
But I just had to hear your voice I guess




Oh
So play your upside down, left handed
Backward bass guitar
I'll see you on the other side superstar




I'm still crying'
I'm crying' for me
Oh
I'm still crying'

I knew when you left me
That you'd be back someday
And I know there's a chance
You'll leave again
But thats one i've gotta take..

Girl after all
What have I got to loose?
The worst that you can do
Is break my heart into

-Chorus-
Smaller pieces
Bigger tear drops
Colder lonely
Hell why not
What's another good bye
Might as well give it one more try
The worst that you can do
Is break my heart into
Smaller pieces

Darlin come on in
What are you waitin for
You might hurt me again
But you can't hurt me any more
So tell me that you love me
And I'll tell myself its true
The worst that you can do
Is break my heart into'

-Chorus-
Smaller pieces
Bigger tear drops
Colder lonely
Hell why not
What's another good bye
Might as well give it one more try
The worst that you can do
Is break my heart into
Smaller pieces

Hell why not
What's another goodbye
Might as well give it one more try
Girl the worst that you can do
Is break my heart into smaller pieces

I knew when you left me
That you'd be back someday


They say when the last tear falls
You can tell by the way it falls
It's like seeing everything for the first time again
It's not like the pain is gone
Just hurts a little bit less
You know you're going to cross that line
Who knows what you're going to find
It's only a matter of time in the end


I'm all cried out
I'll let it run like a river
But it's empty now
And the only consolation is that
I can lie here in this bed
And put these memories to rest somehow
'Cause I'm all cried out


I never knew I had the strength
'Til I finally hit the ground
Now I have to make a choice to get up
Or stay down
For crying out loud


I'm all cried out
I'll let it run like a river
But it's empty now
And the only consolation is that
I can lie here in this bed
And put these memories to rest somehow
'Cause I'm all cried out
And the only consolation is that
I can lie here in this bed
And put these memories to rest somehow
'Cause I'm all cried out
I'm all cried out




Don't bother telling me what I got coming in the morning
I already know
I got some feel-good pills and a red gatorade by my bed
Ready to go

I'm going to do my best to dance with every girl in this bar
Before they shut it down
Then I'll pay my tab climb in a cab
Heading to a spot downtown


It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight


Hey pretty thing
I've been looking at you since the moment that you walked in
I got some wildest buddies that love spending money
And I see you brought a couple of friends

Just tell me your name
I don't need your number or a date next Saturday
Baby let's act like fools break a few rules
Party the night away



Ha-ha slide


It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
I said tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight


Yeah it's all about tonight
Come on it's all about tonight
We're going to get our swerve on a buzz on
It's all about tonight
Come on baby I wouldn't worry about that
It's all about tonight


I got a house down a back road
I got a flag on the front proch
I got a dog named Waylon
I got a driveway that needs pavin'
I got a boat with two stroke
I got some 'guaranteed make ya laugh' jokes
I got friends in low places
Yeah, life is what you make it


I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honkytonk


I got a girl, her name's Shelia
She goes batshit on tequila
I got a job, it gets the job done
I got a loan at the bank; it's a big one
The only place you might see my name
Is on the wall for a good call
I'm a local legend on Friday night
With past blue ribbon and a neon light


I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honkytonk


I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down
I go down to the honkytonk


I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honkytonk


I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down
I go down to the honkytonk


I don't wanna close my eyes
Why pretend I'm going to sleep
When I know damn well I'm gonna keep lying here wide awake?
Waiting for the breath you take, to come back
I can't relax, I'm a tiger pacing in my cage
Cocked like a twelve guage
Feeling like a teenage crush
You're the habit that I can never get enough of


Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal


I, have the right to remain silent
But there ain't no way that I can
'Cause I'm wired like a ticking time bomb
It's so wrong, but it feels right
Tonight you repeating like an echo
Baby I can't let go, got me going klepto like a thief
Yeah I'd steal, just to keep on feeling what I feel


Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal


Oh, don't try to save me
Oh, you never gonna save me


Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal
Yeah, what you do to me is criminal
Yeah, what you do to me is criminal
What you do me is criminal, criminal

Well Bobby had everything
He thought he'd ever need
A fancy new car
And a master's degree
Still he's feelin lost
With no purpose in life
And nothing seems to fill the empty space inside
He sees an ad on late night TV
It says "Change your kids' life with just a couple hours a week"
Normally he'd keep clicking
Just surfin around
But something makes him stop and write that number down
Oh it's amazing
How love changes everything..

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Love changes everything

Well Sarah does her best just to keep the faith
But ever since he left
It's hard to find the strength
She wipes the tear from her eye
As she puts the groceries on the shelf
Cuz after dinner, baths and homework
There's no time for herself
Two jobs, two kids
Too tired to fight
No money, no romance
No end in sight
Just when she thinks she can't go on
She sees a painting on the fridge that says
"I Love You Mom"
Oh it's amazing
How love changes everything

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na

Well I know we've got problems(I know we got problems)

And I know we haven't been talkin
Or touchin much lately
But I know this love(I know this love)
Has got alotta life left in it(Has got alotta life left in it)
So let me hold you close
I don't wanna let you go
Baby let me know we won't wait another minute

It can change the world
It can change your mind
It can change your tire in the middle of the night
It can change your name
It can change your heart
It can change your tune
It can change your life
Love changes everything...

'Bout ten years old, hide and seek
I found me in the closet
Ready or not I stumbled on
And opened up that box of
Yearbooks, letters, black and whites
A hundred, maybe more
Next thing I know my brothers and me
Got 'em scattered on the floor (Yeah)

There was one of her, flippin' the bird
Sittin' on a Harley
And a few with some hairy hippie dude
Turns out his name was Charlie
Her hair, her clothes, her drinkin' smokin'
Had us boys confused
I'll never forget the day us nosey kids got introduced

To Mama, 'fore she was Mama
In a string bikini, in Tijuana
Won't admit she smoked marijuana
But I saw Mama, 'fore she was Mama

We put that box right where it was
And never said a word
But growin' up got hard just tryin'
Not to picture her
In anything but aprons, dresses
Mini-vans and church
Oh and Daddy would have whooped our butts
For diggin' up that dirt

On Mama, 'fore she was Mama
In a string bikini, in Tijuana
She won't admit she smoked marijuana
But I saw Mama, 'fore she was Mama

We laugh and hang it over her head
Right above her halo
Her face turns red when we bring up
That tie-dyed Winnebago
She runs and hides and still denies
That hip high rose tattoo
She burned that box of forget-me-nots
When she found out we knew

About Mama, 'fore she was Mama
In a string bikini, in Tijuana
Won't admit she smoked marijuana
But that was Mama, 'fore she was Mama

And there's that one down in the Bahamas
But that was Mama, 'fore she was Mama


There wouldn't be no Alamo
No Cowboys in the Superbowl
No "Lonesome Dove", no "Yellow Rose"
If it wasn't for Texas


I wouldn't be a Willie fan
Nobody'd swim the Rio Grande
I wouldn't be an American
If it wasn't for Texas


Fort Worth would never cross my mind
An' there'd be no Austin City limits sign
No Lonestar of any kind
If it wasn't for Texas




I'd never've gone to Tennessee
To sing my songs an' chase my dreams
Only Heaven knows just where I'd be
If it wasn't for Texas




It made me the man I am
Thank God for my old stomping' ground
I wouldn't be standing right here, right now
If it wasn't for Texas
If it wasn't for Texas
If it wasn't for Texas


They boarding up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging 'round
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay


If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
'Stead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her (on her)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime


I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough


If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer (longer)
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
'Stead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her (on her)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime
Just a little more summertime

If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer (longer)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime


When I lose my smile
When my thoughts get jumbled
When the air and BS get too thick
Can’t take a breath
Without getting sick
I’ve had enough
With this concrete jungle
I drop my truck in drive
I pick up my baby
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey
We exit off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go
Beyond the pavement


You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo


It ain’t on no map
And I’m glad it isn’t
Leave the phone
And the GPS
Those satellites
Ain’t found it yet
Got our own little
Piece of heaven hidden


You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo


It's not easy saying this to you
It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
But, boy, before you go
I want you to know


I wish you strength when times are hard
Oh, I wish with all my heart you find just what you're looking for
I wish you joy, I wish you peace
And that every star you see's within your reach
And I wish you still loved me


I wish things were different, you know that
But I'm still happy for the times we had
You mean the world to me
Oh, baby, please believe


I wish you strength when times are hard
Oh, I wish with all my heart you find just what you're looking for
I wish you joy, I wish you peace
And that every star you see's within your reach
And I wish you still loved me


Losing you is tearing me apart
But a part of me will be with you, no matter where you are


I wish you strength when times are hard
Oh, I wish with all my heart you find just what you're looking for
I wish you joy, I wish you peace
And that every star you see's within your reach
And I wish you still loved me
Oh, I wish you still loved me
Mmmhmm, mmmhmm

I was born a dreamer
Seemed like every day
My mind came up with something new
But this time it's my heart
With a dream that's here to stay
There's a chance this one might come true

I could see me being with you
For the rest of my life
Two hearts, One love
And I could see you loving me too
Sure would be nice
Two hearts, One love, That's us

I can see my lucky stars when I gaze into your eyes
Twilight shadows hold as tenderly
It's so easy to imagine
You here by my side

As I turn out the lights and fall asleep

I could see me being with you
For the rest of my life
Two hearts, One love
And I could see you lovin me too
Sure would be nice
Two hearts, One love, That's us

I could see me being with you
For the rest of my life
Two hearts, One love
And I could see you lovin me too
Sure would be nice
Two hearts, One love, That's us
Two hearts, One love
Two hearts, One love, That's us


All I saw was smoke and fire
I didn’t feel a thing
But suddenly I was rising higher
And I felt like I just made
The biggest mistake
When I thought about my unborn child
When I thought about my wife
And the answer rang out clear
From somewhere up above
No greater gift has man
Than to lay down his life for love


And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you


Maybe you don’t understand
I don’t understand it all myself
But there’s a brother on my left and another on my right
And in his pocket just like mine
He’s got a photograph
And they’re waiting for him back home
It’s weighing on my mind
I’m not trying to be a hero
I don’t wanna die
But right now in this moment, you don’t think twice


And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you

You don’t think about right
You don’t think about wrong
You just do what you gotta do, to defend your own
And I’d do the same
For you
Yes I would

I would give my life
I would make that sacrifice
Cause if it came down to it
Could I take a bullet
For you
Yes I would

I’d do it for you


It's good to be out again, good to see all my friends
I had to get out of that house
Cause feeling sorry for myself, wasn't working out so well
Awe but baby look at me now
Well it took three months but better late than never
And to think I thought I would hurt forever


But baby tonight I'm alright yea I finally got you off my mind
I'm not here fighting back tears
I'm having the time of my life
Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think I'm drowning in my sorrows
But I swear I'll never love you again til tomorrow


The hangover I'll go through, won't have nothing on you
So bartender, how 'bout another round?
Yea, I know that I'm ignoring all the warnings
But I'll worry about the morning in the morning


Cause baby tonight I'm alright yea I finally got you off my mind
I'm not here fighting back tears
I'm having the time of my life
Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think I'm drowning in my sorrows
But I swear I'll never love you again til tomorrow


When this temporary whiskey fix is over
And it dawns on me that I need you when I'm sober
So maybe you're right, it's time
To get over you and get on with my life


But baby tonight I'm alright yea I finally got you off my mind
I'm not here fighting back tears
I'm having the time of my life
Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think I'm drowning in my sorrows
But I swear that I'm not drowning in my sorrow
Girl I know I'll never love you again, til tomorrow
Til tomorrow


Do not move, baby Do not move
Ah, look at you; I just want to take this in
The moonlight dancing off your skin

Our time let us take our time
I just want to look in your eyes and catch my breath
Because I got a feeling


This could be a one of those memories
We want to hold on to, cling to, the one we cannot forget
Baby this could be our last first kiss, the door to forever
What if this was that moment, that chance we are taking?
History in the making


Inside, baby inside
Can you feel the butterflies floating all around?
Because I can sure feel it now

Tonight, maybe tonight
Is the start of a beautiful ride that will never end
And baby I got a feeling




Right here, right now
Holding you in my arms



From the time she was thirteen
Julie Thompson had a dream
That someday she would see her name in lights
And after every high school play
The grown-ups all would say
That Julie's future sure was looking bright

Well, I saw her selling videos at a store in Eastland Mall
I said
Why aren't you in Hollywood taking casting calls
And she handed me my change
And started laughing

And said
Life happened
Me and Bobby Chaplain fell in love
Daddy passed away and the babies came
And drama school was just too much
Now there's little league and mouths to feed
And I directed the kindergarten Christmas pageant
Life happened

Curtis had an old Chevelle
The cops knew that car well
He never lost a race on Windy Hollow road
By the time he turned eighteen
He was a Georgia dirt track king
Proudly sponsored by the local Texaco

I bumped into him at Murphy's bar
And he ordered us a round
I said
Why aren't you in Rockingham, chasing Gordon down
He killed his drink and tore the corners off his napkin

And said
Life happened
I was driving home from Athens
Late one night
A trucker fell asleep and swapped paint with me
Said I rolled that 'velle at least five times
Now I thank my stars and I sell used cars
And I teach driver's education at St. Catherine's
Yeah, life happened

I saw the rest of my old friends
At our reunion at the Holiday Inn
And it seemed like it was only yesterday
Standing in the gym in our cap and gown
Full of wonderlust and glory bound

We set out to chase our dreams
On wings of passion
But somewhere along the way
We got distracted
Life happened

Our clothes went out of fashion with our songs
We started families and bought SUV's
Became step-dads and soccer moms
I finally realized we turned alright
And we spent the night just catching up and dancing
And life happened

I won't be ignored
I won't be bored
Hey!

I won't be your dirty secret
I won't be your cure-all pill
And I won't run to fetch the water
Just to tumble down the hill

I won't be your Friday paycheck
I won't be the prize you flaunt
And I won't be your Martha Stewart, baby
Or your all night restaurant

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will...but

I won't be your crutch to lean on
I won't wear stiletto heels
I won't walk a mile in your shoes
Just so I know how it feels

I won't be your obligation
I won't be your Barbie doll
I won't be the portrait of perfection
To adorn your wall

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will...but

Bridge:
Hey - you know I will
All right

I won't be your lifetime girlfriend
I won't be just one of the guys
I won't be your mama's favorite
I refuse to be the last in line

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will...but

Yeah, I will, I will, I wll be your everything
I will, I will be the whole shebang
I will, I will be your everything
I will, I will, I will, I will- yeah

You know I will
You know, you know I will
You know I will
You know, you know I will - yeah

You Don't know who I am
But I know all about you
I've come to talk to you tonight
About the things I've seen you do
I've come to set the record straight
I've come to shine the light on you
Let me introduce myself
I'm the cold hard truth
There is a woman we both know
I think you know the one I mean
She gave her heart and soul to you
You gave her only broken dreams
You say your not the one to blame
For all the heartaches she's been though
I say you're nothing but a liar
And I'm the cold hard truth
All your life that's how it's been
Lookin' out for number one
Takin' more than you give
Movin' on when you're done
With her you could have had it all
A family and love to last
If you had any sense at all
You'd go and beg her to come back
Instrumental
You think that you're a real man
But you're nothing but a fool
The way you run away from love
The way you try to play it cool
I'm gonna say this just one time
Time is running out on you
You best remember me my friend
I am the cold hard truth
You best remember me my friend
I am the cold hard truth....


I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams


Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams


Merry Christmas everybody

Sometimes the road just ends
Changes everything you've been
And all that's left to be
Is empty, broken, lonely, hopin'

I'm supposed to be strong
I'm supposed to find a way to carry on

I don't want to feel better
I don't want to not remember
I will always see your face in the shadows of this haunted place
I will laugh, I will cry, shake my fist at the sky, but I will not say goodbye

They keep saying time will heal
But the pain just gets more real
The sun comes up each day
Finds me waiting, fading, hating, praying

If I can keep on holding on
Maybe I can keep my heart from knowing that you're gone

I don't want to feel better
I don't want to not remember
I will always see your face in the shadows of this haunted place
I will laugh, I will cry, shake my fist at the sky, but I will not say goodbye

I will curse, I will pray, I'll relive every day, I will shoulder the blame
I will shout out your name
I will laugh, I will cry, shake my fist at the sky, but I will not say
Will not say goodbye
(Goodbye)

Will not say goodbye
(Goodbye)
Will not say

Have you ever rode a dirt road with the windows rolled down
Smelling that honeysuckle vine
Riding for no reason and you're lookin' not seeing
A house but every few miles
Have you ever been rockin' on the porch with your daddy
Watchin' the world turn slow
That's where country grows

It's in the hearts of those who know what life's all about
It's laying your head on your pillow and fallin' to sleep proud
You bow your head to Jesus 'cause He's where it all comes from
And you know He'll forgive you for the wrong you've done
Ooh, it's in the earth and the church and the words that we speak slow
That's where country grows

Have you ever seen a young boy open up the door
For an old lady walkin' in slow
Or a shoe polish heart on a second hand car
Saying "Shelly loves Billy" on the window
Have you ever heard a mama cry saying goodbye
But she knows her soldiers gotta go, oh
That's where country grows

It's in the hearts of those who know what life's all about
It's laying your head on your pillow and fallin' to sleep proud
You bow your head to Jesus cause He's where it all comes from
And you know He'll forgive you for the wrong you've done

Ooh, it's in the earth and the church and the words that we speak slow
That's where country grows

You bow your head to Jesus cause He's where it all comes from
In the end He'll forgive us for the wrong we've done

Ooh, it's in the earth and the church and the words that we speak slow
That's where country grows
That's where country grows

Have you ever heard a song that changed your life
Coming through the radio
That's where country grows

Its undeniable...that we should be together...
Its unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis you need to know, if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real...
If all things in time, time will reveal...
Yeah...

One...you're like a dream come true......
Two... just wanna be with you...
Three... Gurl its plain to see...that you're the only one for me...and
Four...repeat steps one through three...
Five... make you fall in love with me...
If ever I believe my work is done....then I start Back at One.(yeah)

So Incredible...the way things work themselves out...
And all emotional, once you know what its all about babe...
And undesirable...for us to be apart...
Never would of made it very far...
Cause you know you got the keys to my heart
Cause...

One...you're like a dream come true
Two... just wanna be with you
Three... Gurl its plain to see..that you're the only one for me
Four...repeat steps one through three
Five... make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done....then I start Back at One......

Say farewell to the dark night...I see the coming of the sun...
I feel like a little child..whose life has just begun...
You came and breathed new life
Into this lonely heart of mine...
You threw out the life line...just in the Nick of Time

One...you're like a dream come true
Two... just wanna be with you
Three... Gurl its plain to see..that you're the only one for me..and...
Four...repeat steps one through three
Five... make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done....then I start Back at One

So you had some bad luck, life sucks, can't do nothing right
You took some wrong turns, got burned way too many times
And so you fall back with all that hurt that just don't wanna heal

So then you do the, "Why me? This can't be happening again
Hey, what's the deal? Man, I can't take much more of this"
You put your time in, paid your dues, believe me, I know how you feel

I guess you gotta make a choice when it hits the fan
You can get a little down or get a little mad
When there's stones in the road only one thing to do
You gotta learn to walk with rocks in your shoes, come on!

I heard some good lies from bad guys making their mark
They did a drive by, bang bang, big hole in my heart
Needed a crash cart, CPR sister, I was fading fast

I had a poor me trophy, kept it on a shelf
Did the too proud, too cool to ask for any help
For when I gave in praying I only got one answer back
And he said

I guess you gotta make a choice when it hits the fan
You can get a little down or get a little mad
When there's stones in the road only one thing to do
You gotta learn to walk with rocks in your shoes

It bitters like a weed if you let it grow
It's gonna trip you up, yeah somewhere down the road
To get where you're going there's only one thing to do
You gotta learn to walk with rock's in your shoes
You better learn to walk with rocks in your shoes, come on!

You gotta learn to walk




I wanna drive until my cell phone
Runs out of range and every bar is gone
Cut through the woods another hundred miles
And disappear for a while


I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette, in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low


I wanna end up nowhere on a map
A little cabin sitting so far back
Out in the country just the moon and stars
Are gonna know where we are


I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette, in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low




Just lay low, slow it down
Girl, let's go... and get outta town!..
I wanna hear raindrops falling down


I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette, in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low...


Oh just lay low
Just lay low...


I'm standing in my savior's shadow
He is watching over me
I feel the rain, I hear the thunder
As he cries for me
And standing in my savior's shadow
Grace will lead to where I'm free
I take his hand, we walk together
And his light shines on me


Though the devil tried to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be


I'm standing in my savior's shadow
Following his footsteps there
Every mountain, every ocean
Here's my every prayer


Though the devil tried to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be


Though the devil tried to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be
When I'm in my savior's shadow
Who I'm supposed to be


That night in Phoenix when you stole my Jeep
Then you brought it home with a new stereo, baby, that was sweet
Oh and how can I forget the day you gave me my red guitar
The best gift by far, was you babe I'm sending all that love that you gave


Right back atcha babe
Right back atcha babe just like a boomerang
Everything good you threw my way
Right back atcha babe
Best that you get ready
There's a whole lotta loving that's gonna be coming
Right back atcha babe


First things first, I want you to close your eyes
This may not even come close to that first kiss you gave me
But I'm gonna try
Oh and here's that ring you've been waiting for all these years
As for the tears, that you've cried
When we made love the first time
Yeah I see ya cry

Right back atcha babe
Yeah, right back atcha babe
Right back atcha babe, yeah

I get tears on my pillow
When I get you on my mind
And theres no one to see me when I cry
No one knows how I miss you
When I reach out to kiss you
And theres no one to whisper good nite
Are you lonely, are you lonely
Just like me eee eee eee
Can't you see eee eee
No one will love you the way that I love you
So won't you come back
Because your too much, too much to loose oooose

Do you think theres a chance
To renew, old romance
Why won't you please
Bring your sweet love home to me
Cause I've searched the past forever
And I know there will never be another
Who will set my soul free

Are you lonely, are you lonely
Just like me eee eee eee
Can't you see eee eee
No one will love you the way that I love you
So why won't you come back
Because your too much, too much to loose oooose


A river in July, two kids on summer break
Another record high, clothes scattered on the bank
The rush of jumping in, I want to feel that again


Sun going down, build a fire in the dirt
You're dancing all around, wearing my t-shirt
The way you pull me in, I want to feel that again


Guitar coming through the speakers
That song you never want to end
Gimme some of that you and me
Some of that way back when
A little bit of wild and free
I want to feel that again


Nothing but a blur, gravel road, a flatbed Ford
Always was the cure, ooh whenever we got bored
Sideways 'round the bend, yeah I want to feel that again


Guitar coming through the speakers
That song you never want to end
Gimme some of that you and me
Some of that way back when
A little bit of wild and free
I want to feel that again, yeah

Guitar coming through the speakers
That song you never want to end
Gimme some of that you and me
Some of that way back when
A little bit of wild and free
I want to feel that again
Feel that again


I don't need a lot of things
I can get by with nothing
Of all the blessings life can bring
I've always needed something
But I've got all I want
When it comes to loving you
You're my only reason
You're my only truth


I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you


You're the hope that moves me
To courage again
You're the love that rescues me
When the cold winds rage
And it's so amazing
Cause that's just how you are
And I can't turn back now
Cause you've brought me too far


I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you
Oh yes I do
I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you
Oh, yes I do
I need you
I need you, oh
I need you


Kinda selfish
A little crazy
But you love me anyway, baby
I'm hard to handle
I'm sometimes reckless
With a heart that's always restless


You're the only one
The only one who gets me good
Who knows me like nobody ever could
Who holds me, strong
Who puts me back together when it all goes wrong
Yeah I want you to know you're the only one who gets me


You're timeless
A little glamour
With a little wine you're my tiny dancer
You're the calm
You're the steel
When my mind starts spinning those wheels


You're the only one
The only one who gets me good
Who knows me like nobody ever could
Who holds me, strong
Who can put me back together when it all goes wrong
Yeah I want you to know you're the only one who gets me


Yeah we're home
That's what you feel like
Home


Yeah girl you're the only one who gets me
I, oh who could steal all my attention
Even after all this time
Who loves me so strong
Who can put me back together when it all goes wrong
And I want you to know you're the only one who gets me


You're the only one

One person refused to sit on the back of the bus
She changed the right for all of us
Oh, that's the power of one

Her diary found a light in the dark
A young girl's hope touched millions of hearts
Oh, that's the power of one

One grain of sand can turn the tide
One single spark can light the night
One simple dream, one gentle word
One act of love from someone
Can start a chain reaction
It all begins in the heart
In the power of one

While the others threw stones, he didn't judge
He moved the world with the strength of his love
Oh, that's the power of one

One grain of sand can turn the tide
One single spark can light the night
One simple dream, one gentle word
One act of love from someone
Can start a chain reaction
It all begins in the heart
In the power of one, oh

All the little things we do everyday
The smallest step can bring on a change
Oh, that's the power of one

'Cause one grain of sand can turn the tide
One single spark can light the night
One simple dream, one gentle word
One act of love from someone
Can start a chain reaction
It all begins in the heart
And the power of one
The power of one
The power of one

It's the power of one
Oh, it's the power of one
It's the power of one
The power of one
Hey, yeah, yeah, oh oh


Some people don't know when to quit, and that's why they quit
Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they can't handle it
But that ain't why I started cleaning up my life
Wish it was but, ooh, that would be a lie


I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you girl
No, no, no
Baby can you come over
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you (There ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over (There ain't no hangover like you)
Oh, no, no, no


All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound
One sip and I'm picking up the phone trying not to go home without you
And that ain't nothin' but a whole lotta pain
And that kind of hurt, ooh hers, it ain't worth another drink


I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no
Baby, can you come over
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do I just end up
Head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you, no
Can't get over you, oh, no, no, no
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, no, no, no

Can you come over
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do I just end up
Head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me, yeah drunk me, yeah drunk me
Can't get over you, no (there ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over
(There ain't no hangover like you), oh, no, no, no


It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong


You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"


You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me


You can see that I've been crying
Baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?


You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"


You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me


I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No no, no, no


You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

I don't miss you like I used to
I've pulled your pictures from the wall
I go just where and when I want to
I'm better off now, all in all

My heart ain't broken
It's through aching
And I'm movin on...

CHORUS:
But I cry a little bit everyday
At least one teardrop falls
It doesn't matter rain or shine
I try to leave it all behind
I swear that I'm alright
But in the middle of the night I cry

I used to hear your ghost calling
You'd never let me go to sleep
You always got your way now darling
But you won't get the best of me any longer
I'm stronger, I'm free...

CHORUS

Still I cry a little bit everyday
At least one teardrop falls
It doesn't matter rain or shine
I try to leave it all behind
I swear that I'm alright
But in the middle of the night I cry
I cry
I cry

I gave you everything I had
Oh, but it wasn't enough
It don't seem right to hurt so bad
When all you're giving is love
You wouldn't let me love you
You're just too hard to hold
I gotta break the chains that bind me
So I'm

Gonna take a cab, take a train
Maybe a limousine
Anything to get me out of here
Ain't no way around it
Oh, no doubt about it
One thing is clear
Oh, there's no time for tears

Oh no

A wall too steep
Too high to climb
Is protecting your heart
I tried to break through
Time after time
Oh, but it keeps us apart
I've cried enough to know that
It's killing me to stay
I'd rather be alone
Than hurt this way

Gonna take a cab, take a train
Maybe a limousine
Anything to get me out of here
Ain't no way around it
Oh, no doubt about it
One thing is clear
Oh, there's no time for tears

The time has come
To move ahead
And find what waits for me
Ooh, whoa, whoa

Gonna take a cab, take a train
Maybe a limousine
Anything to get me out of here
Ain't no way around it
Oh, no doubt about it
One thing is clear
Oh, there's no time for
No time for no time for
There's no time for tears
Oh no
No time for tears
Yeah
No time for no time for tears
No time for tears
Oh no no no no


Sometimes I think about you
Wonder if you're out there somewhere thinkin' 'bout me
And would you even recognize
The woman that your little girl has grown up to be?


'Cause I look in the mirror, and all I see
Are your brown eyes, lookin' back at me
They're the only thing, you ever gave to me at all


Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
There's sunny skies as far I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me


I think about how it ain't fair
That you weren't there to braid my hair like mothers do
You weren't around to cheer me on
Help me dress for my high school prom like mothers do


Did you think I didn't need you here?
To hold my hand, to dry my tears
Did you even miss me, through the years at all?


Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
There's sunny skies as far I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me


Forgiveness
Is such a simple word
But it's so hard to do
When you've been hurt


Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
And just in case, you're wonderin' about me
From now on, I won't be in Carolina
Your little girl is off... your little girl is off...
Your little girl is off to Tennessee


If I could have a beer with Jesus
Heaven knows I’d sip it nice and slow
I’d try to pick a place that ain’t too crowded
Or gladly go wherever he wants to go
You can bet I’d order up a couple tall ones
And tell the waitress put ‘em on my tab
I’d be sure to let him do the talkin’
Careful when I got the chance to ask


Tell me, how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
Do you hear the prayers I send?
What happens when life ends?
And when you think you’re comin’ back again?
I’d tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus


If I could have a beer with Jesus
Yeah, I’d put my whole paycheck in that jukebox
And I'd fill it up with nothing but the good stuff
Sit somewhere we couldn’t see a clock


And ask him, how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
Have you been there from the start?
How’d you change a sinner’s heart?
And is heaven really just beyond the stars?
Yeah, I’d tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus


He can probably only stay, for just a couple rounds
But I hope and pray he’s stayin’ till we shut the whole place down


Ask him, how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
What’s on the other side?
Is Mom and Daddy alright?
And if it ain’t no trouble, tell them I said hi
I’d tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
I’d tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus


I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And he's taken just all that I have
But if you want I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know


The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst


I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
If you want I'll try to love again, (try)
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know


The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst


I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
But I'm sure gonna give you a try
Cuz if you want I'll try to love again
(Try to love again, try to love again)
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know, Ohhhh


The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know
The first cut is the deepest
When it comes to bein' lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst


Ohhhh, the first cut is the deepest
Baby I know (baby I know)
The first cut is the deepest
Try to love again

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

She started her new life ten dollars in debt
That's all it took to get started back then
A trip to the courthouse across the state line
No one could stop her, she'd made up her mind
He was eighteen, she wasn't

But she said she was and never thought twice
Came back home as my daddy's wife
She just shook her head when her momma said
"Are you sure he's the one?" She was

He took a job and farmed on the side
He made the ends meet, but she kept 'em tied
Changes were coming to their little world
She said "What would you like, a boy or a girl?"
He said "Are you?"

She said she was and never thought twice
'Bout takin the next step in building their lives
Soon there were three and she tried to be
Everything to us And she was

Those precious moments turned into years
In what seemed like the blink of an eye
I held her hand as I leaned down to ask her
"Momma, Are you ready to say goodbye?"

She said she was but she thought twice
Holdin' my hand as she let go of life
Daddy always said a woman like her
Would be hard to give up
And she was

She was

If there ever was a picture of love
She was


To the teller down at the bank
You're just another checking account
To the plumber that came today
You're just another house
At the airport ticket counter
You're just another fare
At the beauty shop at the mall
Well you're just another head of hair
Well that's alright, that's ok
If you don't feel important, honey
All I've got to say is


To the world
You may be just another girl
But to me
Baby, you are the world


To the waiter at the restaurant
You're just another tip
To the guy at the ice cream shop
You're just another dip
When you can't get reservations
Cause you don't have the clout
Or you didn't get an invitation
Cause somebody left you out
That's alright, that's ok
When you don't feel important honey
All I've got to say is




You think you're one of millions but you're one in a million to me
When you wonder if you matter, baby look into my eyes
And tell me, can't you see you're everything to me

That's alright, that's ok
When you don't feel important honey
All I've gotta say is



Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
Right now I think you see
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

Tried a thousand times, used a million lines
Tryin' to explain
'Cause they don't have a word
For the kind of hurt that never goes away

When I try to think it though, it all comes back to you
I don't know why goodbye's so hard to understand
This pain I have is real an' I'll tell you how it feels
If I ever get the chance

It's like a lonely Friday night downtown
Where everyone I know is out
The radio's my only friend around
And all I do is think of you

It's a little like an old sad song
It kills you but you sing alone
The melody just tears you all apart
It's something like a broken heart

I could drive a hundred miles an' never touch that dial
Till the station fades
'Cause nothin' that I hear
Will ever make it clear words just slip away

And the more I think it through, the more I think of you
I don't know why goodbye's so hard to understand
You're never hard to find, 'cause you're always on my mind
No matter where I am

Just like a lonely Friday night downtown
Where everyone I know is out
The radio's my only friend around
And all I do is think of you

It's a little like an old sad song
It kills you but you sing alone
The melody just tears you all apart
It's something like a broken heart

It's like a lonely Friday night downtown
Where everyone I know is out
The radio's my only friend around
And all I do is think of you

It's a little like an old sad song
It kills you but you sing alone
The melody just tears you all apart
It's something like a broken heart


I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottle
Laying down on the bathroom floor
My loneliness was rattling the windows
You said you don't want me anymore


And you left me standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh, finally I'm through wasting all these tears on you


You ain't worth another sleepless night
And I'll do everything I gotta do to get you off my mind
Cause what you wanted, I couldn't give
What you did boy, I'll never forget


And you left me standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh, finally I'm through wasting all these tears on you
These tears on you
And you left me standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why i'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh finally I'm through wasting all these tears on you
Oh, these tears on you


I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottle
Laying down on the bathroom floor

Baby why you wanna cry?
You really oughta know that I
Just have to walk away sometimes
We’re gonna do what lovers do
We’re gonna have a fight or two
But I ain’t ever changin’ my mind

Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

Wouldn’t last a single day
I’d probably just fade away
Without you, I’d lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was livin’ life all wrong
Smartest thing I ever did was make you all mine

Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

Crazy girl

Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately
I love you like

Crazy, girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

Like crazy
Crazy girl
Like crazy
Crazy girl
Like crazy


I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days


But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to


You're like second nature, baby, you're just like breathing
Melody that you hear and you can't forget
Time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you're worth the heartbreak and the regret


But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to


How not to
Mmmmmm
Oh-oh-oh-oh


I've been your lover, I've been your friend
I've been your faithful one-woman man
I've been your diamond in the rough
Now you say you wanna polish me up


Why, why, why do you want to change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missing the old me around
So why, why, why do you want to change me now


I remember you used to like
Walking with me on my wilder side
My kind of crazy turned you on
Do you really want that part of me gone?


Why, why, why do you want to change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missing the old me around
So why, why, why do you want to change me now


Why, why, why
Ain't I the one?
You might start missing


Why, why, why do you want to change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missing the old me around
So why, why, why do you want to change me now


First I get cold and hot
Think I'm on fire, but I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm going through
It must be love


It must be love, it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Oh what a feeling, it must be love


Something is wrong or right
I think of you all night
Can't sleep 'til morning light
It must be loveSeeing you in my dreams
Holding you close to me
Oh, what else can it be?
It must be love


It must be love, it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Oh what a feeling, it must be love


It must be love, it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove


Woke up late today and I still feel the sting of the pain
But I brushed my teeth anyway
I got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger


Riding in the car to work and I'm
Trying to ignore the hurt so I
Turned on the radio
Stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for minute
But then I changed it
I'm getting a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger


And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger


It doesn't happen overnight but you
Turn around and a month's gone by
And you realize you haven't cried
I'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer
I'm busy getting stronger


And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger


Getting along without you baby
I'm better off without you baby
How does it feel without me baby?
I'm getting stronger without you baby


And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger


And just a little bit stronger
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit stronger
Get a little bit stronger

Usually take one last pass through town
Stop the car and touch the ground
Watch those streetlights swayin' in the breeze
Decorated store fronts
Rusty old gas pumps
Try to fill my mind up
With somethin' before I go
Picture postcard memories
You know they always make for good company

I don't know no town
Like the old town
Even when the miles are many
I feel like I'm still around
Deep inside me
Like rings through an oak tree
Yeah, there something 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone
That keeps me turning home

I'm standin' here beneath these billboard lights
Takes me back to those autumn nights
Hometown bleachers packed real tight
As we marched down the field
My feet would swing from a dropped tailgate
Out on Airport Road real late
No one could walk a line too straight
We usually made it home alright
And glory days I can't re-live
Stories I'll never forget

And I don't know no friends
Like the old friends
I never seem to laugh now
Like I did with them
But deep inside me
A piece of history
Yeah, I hear their voices even though they're gone
And it keeps me turning home

Never twice the same way does it start
And sure enough she stole my heart
On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night
And though we both tried hard to wait
We sure did love the taste
Of the sweet love being made and prayin' I got it right
Graduation came and went
Along with all the time we spent

And I don't know no love
Like the first love
When I think about the best times
She's the one I think of
Deep inside me
All though the taste is bittersweet
I see her smilin' even though she's gone
And it keeps me turning home, yeah


My old friend, I recall
The times we had hanging on my wall
I would not trade them for gold
Because they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
They are woven in the stories I have told
And tell again


My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races
The people and the places
There is always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets slim, my old friend


Do not know why, do not know why
Do not know why, do not know why


My old friend, this song is for you
Because a few simple verses
Was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
Because the love and the laughter
Will live on long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We will meet again, my old friend


Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

My old friend, my old friend
Goodbye, goodbye

Me
It was always all about me
My job, my life, my time was all I cared about
Myself
I only needed myself
To get me though my life
Then suddenly I found that

I want
I need
I crave
I breathe
I feel
I hope
I dream
I know
I trust
I love you

The night I just discovered the night
How magical it is since you're in my arms
Oh, all these days I wake up and I'm amazed
How much I want to give
Since you've touched my heart, and now

I want
I need
I crave
I breathe
I feel
I hope
I dream
I know
I trust
I love you

It wasn't luck
It wasn't fate
There's just one reason our world's changed
Girl, it's you

I want
I need
I crave
I breathe
I feel
I hope
I dream
I know
I trust
I love you


Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like "'Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over


There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
Whatd'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true


Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about


There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true, baby?


Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?


There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
Whatd'you say we make it-
Make it true?
Whatd'you say we make it true?
Come on over here
Let's really give them something to talk about, baby
There's a rumor going round


Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round young virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace


Silent night
Holy night
Shepards praying at the sight
Glory stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hole sang halljaulah
Christ the savor is born
Christ the savor is born


Silent night
Holy night
Shout out god
Loves pure light
Rage of beings from the holy face
With the dawn of amazing grace
Jesus lord at the verge
Jesus lord at the verge


Dontcha look now oh the parking lots full
Gonna ride that cow with a Dallas bull
Everybody in the ATL is coming
DJs got those speakers thumping
Got a Black Ford not a White Mercedes
Walking in the front door checking out the ladies
My buddy says "hey boys, I'm buying"
The hottest girl in here's giving me the eye and


Everybody knows, it's gonna be one of those

That's the stuff I like
That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high

Talking gone gone gone
Turning all the wrongs into right

Workin on the sweet thing sittin on a bar stool
Doin shots of Jack, girl gonna take it old school
Singin hell yeah to every song their playing

You can't raise it high enough
Take your cup, fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
Take your cup, fill it up
You can't raise it high enough


Wasn't really looking when you caught my eyes
Just another town, just another night
Didn't say much, I was scared for my life
I didn't catch your number and didn't know your name
Tried to move on, couldn't help to think of you
And I knew that you'd change everything


What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours


Now there's make up my counter
Your shoes on my floor
Taking my side of the bed and more
But it’s fine, I don’t mind, 'cause you changed everything


What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah, yeah


Take this ring
Forever now
Til death do us apart
And take this vow


What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah, yeah


Last night I had a crazy dream
A wish was granted just for me
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished for one more day with you


One more day, one more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again, I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day


First thing I'd do is pray for time to crawl
I'd unplug the telephone and keep the TV off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do with one more day with you





Leave me wishing still for one more day
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day, one more day

Sailors sail
Cowboys ride
Lovers love when they get the chance
Take it slow
Turn down the light
Soft and low
Let the shadows dance
Baby dont hold back

Chorus:
Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark

Lets strip away everything
Tonight theres nothing getting in our way
The ties that bind, the wheres and whys
Take em off and leave them all outside
Lock it all outside

Chorus:
Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark

Without a single a word
Baby we can say so much
Reveal everything with just one touch
Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark
Kiss me in the dark
Yeahhhh


Was it the pull of the moon now baby
That led you to my door
You say the night's got you acting crazy
I think it's something more
I've never felt the Earth move honey
Until you school my tree
Nobody runs from the law now baby
Of love and gravity it pulls you so strong
Baby you gotta hold on


If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall
You can't take back every little chill you give me
You're going down with me baby heart and all ooh yeah


We're hanging right on the edge now baby
The wind is getting stronger
We're hanging on by a thread now honey
We can't hold on much longer
It's a long way down but it's too late


If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall
You can't take back every little chill you give me
You're going down with me baby heart and all ooh yeah


Ooh baby I couldn't get any higher
This time I'm willing to dance on the wire
If I fall, If I fall


If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall
You can't take back every little chill you give me
You're going down with me baby heart and all ooh yeah


If I fall
If I fall


Like a cloud full of rain shouldn't hang in the sky
Ice shouldn't burn or a bumble bee fly
If you feel so happy, then why do you cry
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense
Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea
A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas
Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me
Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense


Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusin'
You can win when you're losin'
Stand when you're fallin'
I can't figure it out
Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation
Nothin' short of amazin'
Wish I could explain it
But I don't know how


The way that we dance
The reason we dream
That big Italian tower
Oh, how does it lean
Somethin' so strong
Shouldn't make me this weak
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense


Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusin'
You can win when you're losin'
Stand when you're fallin'
I can't figure it out
Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation
Nothin' short of amazin'
Wish I could explain it
But I don't know how


Like the lights of Las Vegas glowin' out of the sand
A jumbo shrimp or a baby grand
How you touch my heart when you hold my hand
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense


Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense


All the pretty girls said pick me up at eight
All the pretty girls said I'm going to L.A
All the pretty girls said I hate my hair
Talking to the mirror in their underwear

All the lost boys said I just got paid
All the lost boys said I wanna get laid
When the town goes blue and the lights blink red
All the lost boys do what all the pretty girls said


I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said


All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said


All the sheriffs said kid, you better slow down
All the preachers said it's the devil's playground
I wonder if they knew they were wasting their breath
All I ever heard was all the pretty girls said


I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said


All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said


All the seventeens said I'm getting outta dodge
All the big dreams said I'm selling all I got
All the high rollers busy placing their bets
Me, I'm heading south cause all the pretty girls said


I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said


All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said


All the pretty girls said

Bottom of my boots sure are gettin' worn
There's a lot of holes in this faded uniform
My hands are black with dirt and so is my face
I ain't never been to hell
But it couldn't be any worse than this place
Tell my wife don't worry 'cause I know what to do
It makes you feel better sometimes, but don't know if it's true
I know if I die it's just my time to go
But I pray to God every day that I may get back home

Well when you've seen what I've seen
Things don't seem so bad
Quit worrying 'bout what you ain't got, thank God for what you have
'Cause I could be raising my family in this place
But I was born an American
By Gods Amazing Grace

For the last twelve months I've had a new address
The neighborhood smells like sewerage and the streets are lined with trash
You never know what's gonna be the next thing to explode
But unlike these people, I have another home
It breaks my heart to see these kids out on the streets
Walking barefoot through the trash, diggin' for something to eat
I give them what I got, just to let them know I care
And I thank God it's not my son that's standing there

Well when you've seen what I've seen
Things don't seem so bad
Quit worrying 'bout what you ain't got, thank God for what you have
'Cause I could be raising my family in this place
But I was born an American
By Gods Amazing Grace

You want to talk about it, you better keep it short
Cause I got a lot of lost time I gotta make up for
Really don't care why Bush went in to Iraq
I know what I done there and I'm damn sure proud of that
You got somethin' bad to say about the USA
You better save it for different ears 'less you want to crawl away
And I laugh in your face when you say you've got it bad
Until you've spent some time on the streets of Baghdad

Well when you've seen what I've seen
Things don't seem so bad
Quit worrying 'bout what you ain't got, thank God for what you have
'Cause you could be raising your family in this place
But you were born in America, By God's Amazing Grace!!!!


Nah, nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home, home, home, home


It's been a long night here and a long night there
And these long, long legs are damn near everywhere
Hold up now
You look good, I will not lie
But if you ask where I'm staying tonight, I gotta be like


Oh baby, nah baby
You got me all wrong, baby
My baby's already got all of my love
So nah, nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home and if I stay I might not leave alone
Nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu, to another I will stay true
I will stay true, I will stay true


Now, better men than me have failed
Drinking from that unholy grail
Now check it out
I got her and she got me and you got that ass
But I kindly gotta be like


Oh baby, nah baby
You got me all wrong, baby
My baby's already got all of my love
So nah, nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home and if I stay I might not leave alone
Nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu, to another I will stay true
I will stay true, I will stay true


Oh, I'm sure you, sure you will make somebody's night
But oh, I assure you, assure you it sure as hell's not mine


Oh no, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home and if I stay I might not leave alone
Nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu, to another I will stay true
Nah, nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home and if I stay I might not leave alone
Nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu, to another I will stay true
I will stay true, I will stay true, I will stay true


I almost said I love you
Could I really be that kind of guy
See one candle burning in your eye
And watch my heart fill up with butterflies
I almost said I need you
Girl I should not go there anymore
Act like I never been in love before
You probably think it is my first time
Is this what love is all about
Am I getting in too deep
Would not want to freak you out
Make a promise I cannot keep


So close your eyes and hum along
And I will sing you one more love song
If everything is still alright
Why do not you just crash here tonight


Girl if everything is still alright
Why do not you just crash here tonight


Connie came back for her second cousin's wedding
First time she'd been home in a year or two
Just in time for the rehearsal dinner
That crazy Connie wasn't wearing any shoes


She lives in L.A. she flies to New York City
That woman's been around the world
You can take the girl out of the honky tonk
But you can't take the honky tonk
Take the honky tonk out of the girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Well the dinner broke up at around 11:30
Boys went out to do what boys do
And Connie said hey girls lets huddle up
Around something 'bout a hundred proof




Well at nine a.m. out in front of that church
People are going nuts looking for the groom
And somebody says hey Bonnie by the way where is Connie
She's run off with that boy to Cancun



I get up on Sunday, about eight-fifteen
Just to get the paper that I never read
'Cause I know she'll be there barely in her robe
Sittin' on her front porch paintin' on her toes
Her husband's always on the road

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Sometimes Mrs. Rudy calls cryin' late at night
'Cause her and Mr. Ugly have had another fight
We talk a while, and I hear her smile
When she says thank you, I tell her that she's welcome
Like any friend would do
I only wish she knew

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Imagination, infatuation
I'm what she deserves
I wonder if she thinks about me
The way I think about her

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Hey
Oh Mrs. Rudy
That wedding ring is as ugly to me
As your husband is to you
Mrs. Rudy
You don't know
You don't know what you do
To me


I borrowed some money I sold my car
I put an airstream trailer up on blocks
That satellite dish was my first mistake
She started watching Oprah Winfrey and Rikki Lake
She cut me down to once a week
At supper time there wasn't nothing to eat
I was paranoid and scared to death
She came home with Aqua Velva on her breath


Burn down the trailer park
Shoot the pink flamingos out in the yard
I can't live here since you broke my heart
I'm gonna burn down the trailer park


She hired the neighbor's son to cut our grass
She gave him cold ice tea and a piece of pie
My landlord came while I was out of town
Our pipes got fixed and the rent went down
We fell asleep with the late show on
Now it's the a.m. I wake up and she's gone
I've got a strong suspicion she's at it again
And since I don't know which trailer she's in




Jenny Jones don't understand Geraldo don't understand
Maury Povich sure don't understand
I've got a can of gas and I'm a dangerous man




Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know


I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats


Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying "I'm drunk"
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
Oh, and he don't know


That I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats


I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me


'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats


Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Oh


She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night


She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are


So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child


She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain


She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold


She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain


So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes


She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain


She's my kind of rain
Oh, rain on me
She's my kind of rain

Just got paid I got a little money
Aftershave and after a honey
Got my name on a shot of Jack whiskey
Gonna roll with me, you gotta roll quickly
Get in, sit down, shut up and hold on
Can't wait, too late, it's time to get gone
Show up downtown, get us a buzz on
Get in, sit down, shut up and hold on
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Shoot a little pool, shoot a little 8 ball
Ain't goin' home
Make a little phone call
Feelin' pretty good
Stumble out the front door
She pulls up in a farm girl Ford singin'
Get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on
Can't wait, too late, it's time to get gone
Find us a dirt road get a groove on
Get in, sit down, shut up and hold on
There's no time like a night time and the moonlight
To have a good time
Baby let's throw down, don't slow down
If I'm gonna go down
I'm gonna go down crazy
Get in, sit down, shut up and hold on
Can't wait, too late, it's time to get gone
Find us a dirt road and get a groove on
Get in, sit down, shut up and hold on
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Get in
Sit down
Shut up
Hold on!
There's no time than the night time
In the moonlight, to have a good time
Baby lets throw down, don't slow down
If I go down, I'm gonna go down crazy
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh)


I kept waiting on a reason
And a call that never came
No, I never saw it coming
Something in you must have changed


All the words unspoken, promises broken
I cried for so long
Wasted too much time, should've seen the signs
Now I know just what went wrong


I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now, I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more


All the nights we spent, just talking
Of the things we wanted out of life
Making plans and dreams together
Wish I'd seen, I was just too blind


My heart was open, exposed and hoping
For you to lay it on the line
In the end it seemed
There was no room for me
Still, I tried to change your mind




Oh, I don't need you
I don't need you anymore




I don't need you
I don't need you anymore


I heard you had to drive him home after two umbrella drinks
I heard he's got a Prius, because he's into being green
My buddies said he saw y'all, eating that sushi stuff
Baby that don't sound like you, that don't sound like love
Sounds like it sucks


He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook


Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down?
Has he took you to meet his mama, back in his home town?
Does he drive the interstate, or does he take them old back roads?
Can he melt your heart with a country song, every good old boy should know?
I didn't think so


He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook


It won't be that long, until you start getting bored
I'll be smiling on the river, reeling in one more


He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook


No baby I ain't even worried
He can't even bait a hook


Bought it with cash
Weeks’ worth of cuttin’ grass
From a senior in the parking lot
That faded ID
Looked a little like me
But honestly it’s still a long shot
So, I studied every word
Memorized every line
Till I worked up the nerve one Friday night
Threw a case of beer up on the counter
At a Circle K
And I became

Said all the right things
Showed up with the smokes
And I bought all the drinks
Whadn’t who I was
But every now and then I got to be
David Ashley Parker
From Powder Springs


That little plastic card got me into bars
Made me friends at the liquor store
Yeah, and I was a hit with the good-looking chicks
Every time I shot, I scored
From Macon to Athens to Daytona Beach
Yeah, I was the guy that could get what you need
It didn’t even matter I whadn’t 21
I had a Georgia license that said I was

Don't my baby look good in them blue jeans?
Tight on the top with a belly button ring
A little tattoo somewhere in between
She only shows to me

Hey we're going out dancing she's ready tonight
So damn good-looking boys it ain't even right
And when bar tender says for the lady
What's it going to be?
I tell him man


She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose
And, she can't stand the thought of sipping' champagne
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs something' with a little more edge and a little more pain
She's my little whiskey Girl
My Ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like them rough


Baby got a '69 mustang
Four on the floor, and you ought to hear the pipes ring
I jump behind the wheel and it's away we go
Hey, I drive too fast, but she don't care

Blue bandana tied all up in her hair
Just sitting there singing every song on the radio




Whoa she's my little whiskey girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like them rough
Yeah, I like them rough
I like them rough


A lot of people called it prison when I was growing up
But these are my roots and this is what I love
Cause everybody knows me and I know them
And I believe that's the way we were supposed to live
Wouldn't trade one single day here in small town USA


Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and ill be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA


Around here we break our backs just to earn a buck
We never get ahead but we have enough
I watch people leave and then come right back
I never wanted any part of that
I'm proud to say that I love this place
Good ole small town USA


Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and ill be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA


I wouldn't trade one single day
I'm proud to say I love this place


Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and ill be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA

Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said, honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain

'Cause I've got friends in low places

Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

Well, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

'Cause I've got friends in low places

Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places


The farmers rise up every morning at five
The truckers drive them eighteen wheelers all night
The factory workers they build it with pride
Twenty-four seven down the assembly line
In every city in every town
Somebody's got to make the world go round


We the people move it we the people know
We the people we run the country
We the people prove it we're the heart and soul
We the people we are the country


Here's to every salesman on the telephone line
And every waitress working hard for those dimes
The middle managers who punch overtime
And anyone fighting wars fires and crimes
Day after day year after year
The mint might print them but the buck stops here




We pay the taxes we pay the bills
So they better pay attention up on Capitol Hill




We the people choose it we the people vote
We the people we run the country
We the people rock it we the people roll
We the people we are the country




God, I'm down here on my knees
Cause it's the last place left to fall
Beggin' for another chance
If there's any chance at all
That you might still be listenin'
Lovin' and forgivin' guys like me
I've spent my whole life gettin' it all wrong
And I sure could use your help, cause from now on


I wanna be a good man
A "do like I should" man
I wanna be the kind of man the mirror likes to see
I wanna be a strong man
And admit that I was wrong, man
God, I'm asking you to come change me
To the man I wanna be


There's any way for her and me to make another start
Could you see what you could do
To put some love back in her heart
Cause it's going to take a miracle
After all I've done to really make her see


That I wanna be a stay man
I wanna be a great man
I wanna be the kind of man that she sees in her dreams
God, I wanna be your man
And I wanna be her man
God, I only hope she still believes
In the man I wanna be

Well, I know this late at night that talk is cheap
Lord, don't give up on me

I wanna be a givin' man
I wanna really start livin', man
God, I'm asking you to come change me

She comes rolling right off the tip of my tongue so easy
She'll be the first damn thing I want when I start drinking
I'm breathing her in, breathing her out, once I pick her up I can't put her down

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

She'll go floating around like a downtown ballroom gypsy
She goes great with ice cold beer or a shot of whiskey
Put one in my hand, her on my lips
Man, that's as good as it gets

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

When the night burns out
And we all go home
Smell of sweet perfume
All over your clothes
Like smoke, ooh, ooh
Like smoke ooh, ooh

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke
She's smoke

When the night burns out
And we all go home
Smell of sweet perfume
All over your clothes
She's smoke, ooh, ooh
She's smoke, ooh, ooh


She hit the door 6:55 sack full of groceries split down the side
Can goods scattered all the way to the curb
Look on her face saying don't say a word
So, it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing
Western sky all turning red
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said


Been gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman
Coffee maker, Copy repairman
Anymore there ain't nothing I swear man that I don't do
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels
Just when it feels like i can't make it through
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you


She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize me
I was gonna run the bank
I was gonna run the math
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath
Back then you know I had this plan
Before all of this reality set in
Here comes life boy ready or not
Hey I wanted it all and that's what I got


Because I'm gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman
Coffee maker, Copy repairman
Anymore there isn’t nothing I swear man that
I don't do
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels
Just when it feels like I can't make it through
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you


She said I'm gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman
Coffee maker, Copy repairman
Anymore there isn’t nothing I swear man that I don't do
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels
Just when it feels like I can't make it through
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman the woman with you


La, la, la, la, la, la


The woman with you


So this is how it ends
This is where it all goes down
This is what "I don't love you" feels like
It ain't the middle of the night
And it ain't even raining outside
It ain't exactly what I had in mind, for goodbye


At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light


I thought she was gonna say
Something 'bout that couple kids and crossing the street
Or something about this beautiful day
But she just looked me in the eye
Said "it's over", didn't try to lie or pick a fight
I might have seen it coming that way


But at a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light


There's a mama calming down a little baby
In the backseat in front of me
There's an old man dressed in his Sunday best
Just waiting on green
But I can't see getting past


This red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine


At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine


At a red light
At a red light
At a red light
At a red light


Red red red red red red red red redneck


Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At the honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night, what
That's right
Yea, and what they call work, digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
And your 4 wheel drive
A country boy can survive


Yea the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aw heck
Red red red red red red redneck


Well the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
You don't do the dougie?
No, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here yep, they still love me
Yea, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'


Yea the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust

Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

Come on through the country side
Down to the river side


We're just back porch sitting
Doing some old school picking
Got some brand new strings on my Gibson

The cooler's down to the last drop
But it won't last that way long
Cause Tommy's making a beer run
So baby, come on

I've been holding this in
From the very first kiss
And I've been losing my mind
Tryina' keep up like this


But we both know that there comes a time
And I hate to sound harsh, or unkind


Love me or leave me alone
Hold me or just let me go
Cause I’ve felt this fire for so long
So baby love me, love me
Love me or leave me alone


If we’re just playin' along, then we’re just playin' ourselves
And I don't want you to know where somebody is
Cause there’s magic between you and I
And I hate this impatience of mine


Love me or leave me alone
Hold me or just let me go
Cause I’ve felt this fire for so long
So baby love me, love me
Love me or leave me alone


Cause we both know that there comes a time
And I hate to sound harsh, or unkind


Love me or leave me alone
Hold me or just let me go
Cause I’ve felt this fire for so long
So baby love me, love me
Love me or leave me

Just love me, love me, love me or leave me alone


I wanna buy you a drink, maybe one for this whole town
I may not have that much, but I don’t mind spreading it around
Everybody chasing something, I don’t know why they’re running
I take my time to the finish line, cause we all end up with nothing


I don’t know why, know why
Everybody wanna die rich
Diamonds, champagne
Work your way down that list
We try, everybody tries
Tries to fit into that ditch
You can’t take it with you when you go
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch


Started my day, giving away
All of my baseball cards
It felt so good by the afternoon, I gave some guy my car
It ain’t about what you’re driving
Or about the gold you’re piling
The less I have to worry about
The more time I got for smiling


Don’t know why, know why
Everybody wanna die rich
Champagne, new plane, work your way down that list
We try, everybody tries
Tries to fit it into that ditch
Can't take it with you when you go
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch


You can stack it up, pack it up
Tie it with a big red bow
Get a great big truck
Back it all up, but you can’t take it with you when you go
Can't take it when you go


I don’t know why, know why
Everybody wanna die rich
Diamonds, champagne, newest of the new planes, work your way down that list and
We try, everybody tries
Tries to fit it into that ditch
Can't take it with you when you go
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch

Hey ey
Hey ey
Give it away
Hey ey
Give it away


They say it takes more now
To do what our Mom & Daddy's did
They made it look so easy
Working hard and raising kids
If you get in trouble at school
You got in trouble at home
You can't outrun mommas wooden spoon
Or the principles telephone
Raise your hand if you only had
Three channels on TV
And that little town
That kept you down
Is where you wanna be


Yeah I'm one of you 
Yeah I'm one of you
No your not by yourself
There's somebody else
Who's been there too
If you still wish you still had
Some growing up to do
Your one of me
And I'm one of you


Tell the truth
Do you still wonder
How fast your car will go
When Sweet Home Alabama
Comes on the radio
I bet Jesus, and your momma
Now their way up there
On your mind
Anytime you take a sip
Or you walk across the line
If you understand why your old man
Said the whole worlds gone to hell
But you still believe the American Dream
Is alive and well


I'm one of you
Yeah I'm one of you
No your not by yourself
There's somebody here
Who's been there too
I know what ya thinking
What ya drink
And I know why you do
Your one of me
Yeah and I'm one of you


Do you feel a little bit
Out of touch
Or politically incorrect
Then you and me both agree
What did you expect


I'm one of you
Yeah I'm one of you
No, No your not by yourself
There's somebody else
Who's been there too
I know what you think
About the good 'ol
Red, White, and Blue
You're one of me
And I'm one of you


You're one of me
And I'm one of you


Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Or get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare


This is where the rubber meets the road
This is where the cream is gonna rise
This is what you really didn't know
This is where the truth don't lie


You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think "What's in it for me?"
Or "It's way too far"
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are


Everybody wants to slap your back, wants to shake your hand
When you're up on top of that mountain
But let one of those rocks give way, then you slide back down
Look up and see who's around then


This ain't where the road comes to an end
This ain't where the bandwagon stops
This is just one of those times when
A lot of folks jump off


You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think "What's in it for me?"
Or "It's way too far"
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are


When the water's high
When the weather's not so fair
When the well runs dry
Who's gonna be there?


You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think "What's in it for me?"
Or "It's way too far"
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are, yeah
You find out who your friends are


Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Man I've been there
Or get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare
Man I've been there
Man I've been there


Where do we start?
How 'bout right here where we are?
You've been carryin' this weight around
Walk in the door and lay it down
Life goes fast
It's been a while, I have to ask
Where have you been? How did that feel?
Where are we now? 'Cause that's what's real, yeah


All the space and the time between us
Man, you should have seen us
This ain't no mystery
Our future is our history


I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same


What comes next
We don't know, we're not there yet
But I bet it's gonna shine
Brighter than all we left behind


In a room in a blink and now it's
Like we never went a day without it
Pick it back up where we left off
This is liftoff (three... two... one)


I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same


Ooh-ooh, watch it spinnin'
And ooh-ooh, jump right in an'
And ooh-ooh, let's begin
And we can see, don't have to be
A big step, just imagine
Take a breath, let it happen
When I hear you laugh
It sets me free, it sets me free


I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same


I feel alive  (here we are), and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same

Thumb stuck high in the air
Destination anywhere
This road decides to go
Underneath the desert sky
I find a place to hide and rest my weary bones
This underpass will shade the heat
As my mind drifts off to sleep...

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You would always be my only girl
But that's another place in time
Back when you were mine
In another world

A car stops way up ahead
I climb inside her hair is red
I thank her for the ride
She talks the miles away
I nod and smile and try to say
Anything to be polite
But as the darkness ends the day
Another voice whisper's my name

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You would always be my only girl
But that's another place in time
Back when you were mine
In another world

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight (beautiful sight)
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You would always be my only girl
But that's another place in time
Back when you were mine
In another world

In another world
In another world


I worked all week
Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
I got the cover off the '68
I fire it up and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She’s a rocking them holey jeans
Baby what you got going on Saturday?
You know words got it there’s gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine


Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party


If you wanna drink
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sipping on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
You can be my tan-legged Juliet
I’ll be your Redneck Romeo


Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party




Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party


Y'all ready for this?
Y'all gonna turn it on up

You're not just someone that I
Think about from time to time
Girl you're on my mind a lot, nonstop
You're not just a picture on my wall
Not just womeone that I call
Right before I fall asleep, baby

You are the song that's playin' in my head
The best book I ever read
And all the passion that exists in every kiss
You are the little whisper in my ear
That says the things I love to hear
It's obvious who's in my heart
You are

Your'e more than just someone I see
When I need some company
I want you with me a lot, nonstop
You're more than words could ever say
More than a poet could convey
But I'll try anyway just so, you'll know

You are the song that's playin' in my head
The best book I ever read
And all the passion that exists in every kiss
You are the little whisper in my ear
That says the things I love to hear
It's obvious who's in my heart
You are

You are the song that's playin' in my head
The best book I ever read
And all the passion that exists in every kiss
You are the little whisper in my ear
That says the things I love to hear
It's obvious who's in my heart
You are

Oh girl, you are

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

Well, ask anybody I'm a pretty good guy
And the looks decent wagon didn't pass me by
There ain't nothin in my past that I'm tryin hard to hide
And I don't understand why I gotta wonder why

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

Cruise all around the right parking lots
Little time gets killed alotta bull gets shot
One who'll think I'm kinda cute and laugh at every joke I got
When I get to thinkin maybe she's athinkin maybe not

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

Had an old man tell me "Boy if you were smart
You'd hit the produce isle at the Super Walmart"
So I bumped into a pretty girl's shopping cart
But all I did was break her eggs and bruise her artichoke hearts

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town...

Well I heard he needed some help on the farm
Somebody with a truck and two strong arms
Not scared of dirt and willin' to work
Till the sun goes down
So I pulled up and said I'm your man
I could start right now and we shook hands
He said the fence needs fixin',
The peaches need pickin'
And the cows need bringin round

I was haulin hay, I was feedin the hogs
And that summer sun had me sweatin like a dog
So I cooled off in the creek
Then it was back to work in the daggum heat
I was cussin' out loud, thinkin bout quitin'
Lookin' back now I'm sure glad I didn't
Cuz just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I caught glimpse of the farmer's daughter

She was just gettin' home from Panama city
She was all tanned up and my kinda pretty
When her eyes met mine
I was thinkin that I would sure love my job
As the days got shorter our talks got longer
The kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger
So we'd hop in the truck and get all tangled up
Every chance we got
We were down by the river all night long
When the sun came up I was sneakin' her home
And draggin my butt to work
With the smell of her perfume on my shirt
I'd be on the tractor she'd be on my mind
With that sun beatin' down on this back of mine
Just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I fell in love with the farmer's daughter
We got married last spring
Woah and there ain't no better life for me

I'm still haulin' hay and feedin' the hogs
And that summer sun has me sweatin' like a dog
So I cool off in the creek
And she brings me outta glass of sweet ice tea
I'm on the tractor and shes on my mind
And I can't wait till its quitin' time
And just when I think it can't get no hotter
I come home to the farmer's daughter
Yeah the farmer's daughter


If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen
First I'd prove it's me by sayin' look under your bed
There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah, I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare


And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife
Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me


At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full
On second thought forget it, that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and daddy is right
And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman, she spends so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath and she's polishing you 'til you shine


And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally but you're stayin' home instead
Because if you fail Algebra, mom and dad will kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me


You've got so much up ahead, you'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end up sayin' have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life


I guess I'll see you in the mirror, when you're a grown man
P.S.: Go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can


And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish, I wish you'd taken typin' class
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be, I'd say have a little faith and you'll see


If I could write a letter to me
To me

Well the party started early
About a quarter to three
Just a few close friends
Charlie, Troy, and me
We just got started when somebody asked
How long you think this party's gonna last?

I said all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long

Well the next door neighbors started raising a fuss
Said you had a party and you didn't call us
I said put on your dancing shoes and come along
We'll be here till the cows come home

I said all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long
(and that's all night long)

(Ahh, guitar)

We'll be jumping through the windows and sneaking down the halls
Dancing on the ceiling, dancing on the wall
The last thing I remember 'fore the lights went out
I jumped up on the table and I started to shout

I said all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long
(I mean all night long)

I said all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long

Passenger side, I slide on in
Vinyl seats soft from the heat of the sun
Chewin' on a Slim Jim, can't stop thinkin' 'bout him
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's the one
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's the one

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet
When I look to my left see his suntanned hands
His muddy river hair and his thousand acre plans
I'm all shook up like a quarter in a can
Ain't life sweet in the passenger seat, yeah

I daydream of me an' a cold cotton pillow
And the feel of his skin
The window sill smiles and before I know it
I'm miles away a-sittin' next to him
Miles away a-sittin' next to him

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet
When I look to my left see his suntanned hands
His muddy river hair and his thousand acre plans
I'm all shook up like a quarter in a can
Ain't life sweet, yeah

Shiftin' those gears, baby, 1, 2, 3
Then he shifts those ocean eyes back to me
Can't imagine a moment any better than this
Then we kiss

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, oh yeah, life's so sweet, it's...
Life's so sweet, it's...
Life's so sweet, it's...
So sweet in the passenger seat

Life's so, life's so, life's so sweet
Right here

I've got a cold beer in my right hand
In my left, I got my wedding band
I been wearing it 'round now for way too long
And I'm more than ready to see it gone
And I'm the only one who can set myself free
So I'm taking off this pain you put on me

I remember when you gave me that ring
It was supposed to mean something
Instead, it didn't mean a whole lotta nothing
You don't never even talk to me
I just get to do your laundry
You sit there and you watch the TV
Even when I'm looking sexy

But now I got this cold beer in my right hand
In my left, I got my wedding band
I been wearing it 'round now for way too long
And I'm more than ready to see it gone
And I'm the only one who can set myself free
So I'm taking off this pain you put on me

And right now I'm feeling so right
Hey, I'm having a ball tonight
And I'm being noticed for the first time in a long time
How're you doing sitting at home?
I hope you feel lost and alone
And I hope you miss me every second that I'm gone

While I got this cold beer in my right hand
In my left, I got my wedding band
I been wearing it 'round now for way too long
And I'm more than ready to see it gone
And I'm the only one who can set myself free
So I'm taking off this pain you put on me

Yeah, I'm the only one who can set myself free
So I'm taking off this pain you put on me

I've got a cold beer in my right hand
In my left, I got my wedding band


Backseat of her daddy's car
I was trying not to go too far
Kept thinking about the words the preacher man said
Lightning flashed across the sky
I saw love in a young girl's eyes
And that's a look you never forget


Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by wild and free
Going any way the wind blew, baby
Seventeen, living on crazy dreams
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans
And standing on the edge of everything
Seventeen


Legs hanging off the Bayou Bridge
Feeding fish potato chips
And talking about the mysteries of the universe
Yeah, the world was somewhere else
We had the summer all to ourselves
And the stars went off like fireworks


Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by wild and free
Going any way the wind blew, baby
Seventeen, living on crazy dreams
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans
And standing on the edge of everything
Seventeen

Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by wild and free
Going any way the wind blew, baby
Seventeen, living on crazy dreams
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans
And standing on the edge of everything
Seventeen


Just like you know your southern stars always going to come back out
I’ll give you everything I got like nobody else you found
Open up your heart, open up your eyes, baby listen to the sound
Of my voice when I tell you girl don’t worry I ain't ever going to let you down
I want to show you where I'm from, take you for a ride on a long dirt road
Let you see, let you taste, let you feel, just a little bit of that moonshine glow
I won’t hold you down, or hold you back, but I won’t let you go
This ain't no one night show


I heard you looking for a good man
To hold you with some good hands
Somebody get you through the bad land
So you looking for a good man
Well you looking at a good man now


I'll climb your tower, slay your dragons, fight your battles girl
I’ll take a bullet for you, I’ll take on the whole world
Don’t even worry bout it, I like it yeah, I got you girl
Cam on won’t cha give it a whirl




I ain't no bad boy, I used to be but I ain't no more
(I ain't no bad boy, I ain't no bad boy)
I ain't no bad boy, I used to be but I ain't no more
(I ain't no bad boy)




Yeah you looking at a good man now ain't you girl

You can't forget what love was wearing
When it walked out your front door
Where you fell down to your knees
And can't forget the kind of suitcase
That was packed out on the sidewalk
While you cried there beggin' please
But love remembers

You can lie and tell yourself
You're over it and someone else will take love's place
And this is for the best
You can lie in that bed
In a stranger's arms reachin' for comfort
Close your eyes and still get no rest

Cause love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Yeah love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beatin' down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers

You might convince yourself
There's shelter in a bottle
For a while there it might numb the pain
But when it hits you, then it hits you
That love's still gone and you'll be wishin'
That you'd poured it down the drain
'Cause love remembers

The taste of cotton candy lip gloss
On the lips of a long kiss
And the plans they made together
Yeah love remembers
To feel the fingertips
Running through soakin' wet hair
On the bank after a midnight swim
Yeah love remembers

Yeah love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beatin' down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers

Love remembers
(Love remembers)
(The sound of the pouring rain)
Beatin' down on the top of a car
(On the side of the road)
(Where it couldn't wait)

I can't be with you now
But I know how you are
You're staring up at the sky
And wishing on a star

That I was still there
But Im closer than I seem
Just close your eyes
And dream your way with me

Dream your way to me
Dream your way to me

Ill hold your hand
We'll fly through the clouds
And when you wake up tomorrow
There won't be a doubt

We were together
All you have to do is believe
If this is where you want to be
You can dream your way to me

Dream your way to me
Dream your way to me

We don't ever have to be apart
As long as you can dream your way to me

Soon well be together to stay
When your wish comes true
But until that day

Dream your way to me
Dream your way to me

We don't ever have to be apart
As long as you can dream your way to me
Dream your way to me
(Dream)


Baby what's on your mind
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now


Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?


Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna


Karaoke in the neon light?
Go to Vegas, stay up all night?
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show
Or maybe just lay low?
I gotta know now


Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?


Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now


Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now
We can take it back downtown
You know I don't care now
Just wanna take you there now
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?


Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Oh baby
Tell me do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Baby
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go flyin' down a two lane road?
Find a limb to hang your clothes on?
Oh, babe, tell me
Do I make you wanna?


She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me


She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me


I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me


She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can't even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me


She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me


I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me


Have you ever picked guitar on your front porch
In the morning as the sun was rising?
Or followed your dog down to the river
And ran into an ole’ baptizing?
Do you think to pull off on the side of the road
When that big black hearse is passing?
Have you ever helped someone in need
Without them even asking?
We do that in the country
Let me tell you about country


Country can be in the middle of a city
Country can be on a farm
Country ain’t even a place on the map
It’s a place in your heart


Would you ever hitch a ride to Music City
Just to see an Opry show?
Would you drive across the country
Just to listen to some country?


Country can be in the middle of a city
Country can be in a barn
Country ain’t even a place on the map
It’s a place in your heart


Have you ever been there at the courthouse square
For the parade on the Fourth of July?
With a tear on your face, and a lump in your throat
As you watch ole’ glory go by
Or sat through a service where they played taps
For a soldier who never came home?
Or looked in the sad brown eyes of his momma
As she touched his name on that stone?
He fought for his country
And died for his country
Yeah, I love my country


Let me tell you about country


It's like jumping it's like leaping
It's like walking on the ceiling
It's like floating
It's like flying through the air

It's like soaring
It's like gliding
It's a rocket ship you're riding
It's a feeling that can take you anywhere


So why they call it falling?
Why they call it falling?
Why they call it falling?
I don't know


There was passion
There was laughter
The first morning after
I just couldn't get my feet to touch the ground

Every time we were together
We'd talked about forever
I was certain
It was heaven we had found




But you can't live your life
Walking in the clouds
Sooner or later
You have to come down


It's like a knife
Through the heart
When it all comes apart
It's like someone takes a pin to your balloon

It's a hole
It's a cave
It's kind of like a grave
When he tells you that he's found somebody new


And why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Now I know

Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Now I know

Well it's snowing in Miami and it's hailing in L.A
Money's growing like green apples on the trees
I've been hanging out with Elvis, yeah and all my bills are paid
And they're giving away Cadillacs for free
The whole world gets along
And I haven't thought about you once since you've been gone
I've forgotten you
I've forgotten every single time you kissed me
I don't miss it like you think I do
I've forgotten you
How you held me and it felt like it's what you were born to do
If I lie enough it might come true, I've forgotten you
There's a million things about you, I don't remember anymore
Like that time we got that cabin up in Boulder
I don't remember how you kissed me up against that old oak door
Ain't it funny how things fade right when it's over
Yeah I'm doing fine
I sleep just like a little baby every night
I've forgotten you
I've forgotten every single time you kissed me
I don't miss it like you think I do
I've forgotten you
How you held me and it felt like it's what you were born to do
If I lie enough it might come true, I've forgotten you
Can't you see how I've moved on
No, I haven't thought about you once since you've been gone
I've forgotten you
I've forgotten every single time you kissed me
I don't miss it like you think I do
I've forgotten you
How you held me and it felt like it's what you were born to do
If I lie enough it might come true, I've forgotten you


Yeah I know that the woes and the weight of the world
Can get in side our minds and be too much sometimes, I know
But baby don't let the no's and the ups and the downs
From the roller coaster ride beat you up inside, baby don't
But if you ever feel that way, don't you ever hesitate, cause


You got my number you can call on me
If you're in trouble put the fall on me
When you're mad you can take it out on me
When it don't add up you can count on me
When you're low come get high on me
Make it slow take your time on me
Said let, let it out
Come and lay on me
When it gets heavy put the weight on me
Baby put it all on me
Put it all on me


Wanna take you out on the town on my dime anytime, tell me when you're free
We can do anything and everything you want yeah
Oh I wanna hear all your fears and your troubles

When it's nobody but you and me just us
Girl you know I'm here for you
You can lean on me anytime you need to

Sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you


Woke up this morning to your sleepy smile
I realized I haven't told you in a while
That you're my life, you're my dream
You're the reason for every song I sing
You're my rock, you're my world
You're my always and forever, girl


Sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart, one kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me


Yeah, you're sweet like chocolate, hot like Sriracha
Yeah, girl you got me right in your back pocket
You're smooth like whiskey, fine like wine
I love how you're making my blood sugar rise


My sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart, one kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me


When the world gets cold on those sleepless nights
Oh, girl, you should know that you will always be mine


My sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart, one kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me


Oh, yeah, you gave your sweet heart to me
Oh, yeah, you gave your sweet heart to me
Oh, please give your sweet heart to me

I was born in a hurry but there wasn't any place to go
Nowhere fast seemed better than nowhere slow
I never really got the hang of hanging around

Oh when you get down to it
I guess I always knew it
What it is that makes my world go round

It's a matter of horsepower
For 8 seconds or miles per hour
That's the way I am and that's a fact I can't ignore
Yea, big boy legged, fuel injected
Running wild, radar detected
Man can always stand a little bit more
Horsepower

Well the view looks better from ahead than it looks behind
I've got a need to speed and I don't mean the drugs-store kind
Some people like a life that barely moves at all
I say more power to them
Then I fly right through 'em
Til it slows down to a crawl

It's a matter of horsepower
For 8 seconds or miles per hour
That's the way I am and that's a fact I can't ignore
Yea, big boy legged, fuel injected
Running wild, radar detected
Man can always stand a little bit more
Horsepower

Then I think about horsepower
For 8 seconds or miles per hour
It's the way I am and it's a fact I can't ignore
Yea, big boy legged, fuel injected
Running wild, radar detected
Man can always stand a little bit more
Horsepower

I've been thinkin about horsepower
For 8 seconds or miles per hour
It's the way I am and it's a fact I can't ignore
Yea, big boy legged, fuel injected
Running wild, radar detected
Man can always stand a little bit more
Horsepower

Well, they say that I'm too country
The way I look and sound
They wanna to make me over
Just a little more uptown
Say I need to change my image
Now tell me what's that mean?
Don't they know I've got country in my genes?

Well, I can't help the way I talk
I wouldn't change it if I could
Sophisticated ain't my style
But country fits me good
I ain't ashamed to wear
What's been handed down to me
Lord, I've got country in my genes


I've got country in my genes
Country in my blood
It goes back generations
It's something I'm proud of
It's something I was born with
What you get is what you see
I'm just an old hillbilly
With a country song to sing
Lord, I've got country in my genes

Oh, that Earl Scruggs

If country's hit the big time
Me I'm still the same
I ain't above my raising
And I ain't about to change
I wouldn't trade my Wranglers
For the finest gabardine
Lord, I've got country in my genes



I've got country in my genes
Country in my blood
It goes back generations
It's something I'm proud of
It's something I was born with
What you get is what you see
I'm an old Kentucky hillbilly
With a country song to sing
Lord, I've got country in my genes
Lord, I've got country in my genes


Walking down the street, hand in mine
It don't keep them other guys
And their wandering eyes from looking at you
That's alright and that's okay
Who can blame 'em anyway?
You're so pretty, and you ain't even got a clue


Cause everywhere we go girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
What's your name?
Who's that girl, with the prettiest smile in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
The star of the show
You're the star of the show, yeah, baby


Friday night on the town
We walk in and you draw a crowd
Even the band seems to sing for you
Ease on up, order a drink, barkeep says its all on me
You look at me and laugh
Like you don't know what to do
Baby you're so cute


Cause everywhere we go girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
Whats your name?
Who's that girl, with the prettiest smile in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
The star of the show, yeah
You're the star of the show, baby, yeah yeah


Even in a ponytail in a pair of jeans you look like a cover
Of a magazine, baby you're the only one who doesn't see


That everywhere we go girl
You're the star of the show
And everyone's wondering and wanting to know
Whats your name?
Who's that girl with the luckiest guy in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are, baby
You are, you are, you are, you are
The star of the show..


Don't you know, you're the star of the show, baby

Got a picture of you I carry in my heart
Close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark
Got a memory of you I carry in my soul
I wrap it close around me when the nights get cold
If you asked me how I'm doin' I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

I still wait for the phone in the middle of the night
Thinkin' you might call me if your dreams don't turn out right
And it still amazes me that I lie here in the dark
Wishin' you were next to me, with your head against my heart
If you asked me how I'm doing I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

Minutes turn to hours, and the hours to days
Seems it's been forever that I've felt this way

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Oh, somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by
That I don't think of you


We went out for beers and a couple laughs
Knowing full well that every bad joke that Jimmy told
Might be his last
So we laughed like the world wasn't at war
Said things to him we'd never said before
And he teared up as he held up his glass
He said, boys if I dont make it back-


Have a beer for me
Don't waste no tears on me
On Friday night sit on the visitors side
And cheer for the home team
Drive my Camaro
90 miles an hour down Red Rock Road
With "Born to Run" blasting on the radio
And find someone good enough for Amy
Who will love her like I would have
If I don't make it back


We said hey man now that ain't gonna happen
Don't even think like that
We know you, you'll pull through without a scratch
He pulled me aside in the parking lot
Said Amy and me we're gonna tie the knot
You're my best man, just wanted you to know that
Just in case I don't make it back


Have a beer for me
Don't waste no tears on me
On Friday night sit on the visitors side
And cheer for the home team
Drive my Camaro
90 miles an hour down red rock road
With "Born to Run" blasting on the radio
And find someone good enough for Amy
Who will love her like I would have
If I don't make it back


If the good Lord calls me home
I'd like to think my friends will think about me when i'm gone
Well Miller Light ain't my brand
But I drink one every now and then in his honor
And we ain't missed a home game yet
Had that Camaro at 110 on Red Rock Road
When the speakers blow
And I introduced Amy to a friend of mine from Monroe
He's a good old boy
But you know, she just ain't ready


I'm the driver
Bringing this circus to town
First one in and the last rolling out
Shutting down
The up-all-nighter
All the stars and sunrises I've seen
Every cornfield and town in between
West to east


Oh, easy come, easy go
Yeah, we rock, then we roll out of town
But for now, while the moment is here
Shine a light, drink a beer, let's get loud
All the drivers and dreamers
Believers and singers
Oh, won't you sing with me now?
Oh-whoa oh-oh-oh


I'm the dreamer
Soaking up every line
Searching for truth all the time
Oh, yeah, I'm the believer
That music can save us all
The one who's at every show
In the front row, singing


Oh, easy come, easy go
Yeah, we rock, then we roll out of town
But for now, while the moment is here
Shine a light, drink a beer, let's get loud
All the drivers and dreamers
Believers and singers
Oh, won't you sing with me now?
Oh-whoa oh-oh-oh


I'm the singer
Pouring out all that I have
Every love song and heartbreak gone bad
And looking back
When I was younger
Sitting right there where you are
Sending a prayer to the highest star
And here we are
Oh, here we are


Oh, easy come, easy go
Yeah, we rock, then we roll out of town
But for now, while the moment is here
Shine a light, drink a beer, let's get loud
The drivers and dreamers
Believers and singers
Oh, won't you sing with me now?
Oh-whoa oh-oh-oh


The sun is setting on your last good try
Here I am again with half a goodbye
Wonder if you're really gone this time
Just when I'm about to lose my mind
There you are again on my phone
The moon is rising and you're all alone
Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile


Oh no, here I go


Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?


I'd never ever meant to get so into you
Thought I was using you just to get me through
You know I'm broken, I don't trust anyone
Last thing I needed was to fall in love
You've got me dreaming, got me thinking, I've got some hope
There is nobody else I wanna get to know
But I'm so scared, I don't know what to do
How did you get me so into you?


Oh no, here I go


Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?


There's your reasons
There's your cards
What are you waiting for?
The one to break my heart


Yeah, you can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Oh, go on and break, go on and break my heart
Go on and break, go on and break my heart


Let's blow out these city lights
Let's just leave it all behind
Get up where the air is still
You can hear the whippoorwill
Start a fire, pass the 'shine
Won't be home 'til morning time
Shout your name out in the wind
Confess my love for you again
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge


Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge


Hey, now, honey child
We'd be running free and wild
No one care what you do
Ain't no law to answer to
Dance around in the dirt
Listen to them crickets chirp
Hear old Jake start to howl
When he hears that old hoot owl
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge


Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge


Come on, girl, it's almost dawn
Let's get it 'fore the magic's gone
Tall, tall grass all around
Come on lay that blanket down
Wild flowers just like you
Lay on me like morning dew
Now take my hand walk with me
Sun come up through them trees
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge


Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge
(Three, four)


Ain't no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains you're gonna get wet
But that old 302 ain't let me down yet


It's a cutout picture of the 70's
When everything felt so free


It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol' Bronco


I flipped it over up on Arnold Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
You know where I been by that old oil spot
Most times it's in the beach bar parking lot


No it ain't hard to pick me out
Cause it's the only one in this town


It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No, I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco


Yeah it's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco
My ol' Bronco


We broke up, yeah, it's tough
Most guys would've been crushed
Wasting their time, wondering where they went wrong
No way, not me
Hey, I'm doing just fine
I'm not afraid of moving on


It's easy going out on a Friday night
Easy every time I see her out
I can smile, live it up
The way a single guy does
But what she, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy


The truth is I miss lying in those arms of his
But I don't ever let it show
I laugh and I act like I'm having the time of my life
As far as he knows


It's easy going out on a Friday night
Easy, every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up
The way a single girl does
But, what he, what he don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy
Oh, it's easy


Oh, it's easy going out on a Friday night
Oh, it's easy, every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up
Forget about the way, oh
But, what she, oh what he don't know, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, it looks so easy
So easy, yeah-ooh

I have my heroes, but no one knows their names
They never asked for recognition, they never wanted fame
My Granddad fought the second World War
When he was just eighteen
He spent four months as a prisoner
To give me the American dream
In my eyes he's everything, all I hope to be
And I won't forget that day he said he was proud of me

So I'll take that one day and figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way for the rest of my life
What I did right

I have my good friends, they have a place inside my heart
But my best friend, well she holds the
Biggest part
She finds the good in me
She knows just what it takes
And she loves the man in me
Through all my mistakes
In my eyes she's everything, everything to me
And I won't forget the day she said
"You're all I need"

So I'll take that one day and figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way for the rest of my life
What I did right

And I hold my newborn baby
To give her comfort while she cries
In this moment I feel helpless
'Til she looks into my eyes, her tears subside

So I'll take that one day and figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way for the rest of my life
What I did right


I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
Cause your precious heart is a precious heart
He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you


What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter


Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one
To heal all the pain that he put you through
It's a love like you never knew
Just let me show you


What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise, I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter


I wanna believe that you got me baby
I swear I do from now until the next life
I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart


What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter


What if I fall?
What if I cry?
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter


Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out lookin'
For a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl


Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care


Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan
And it didn't take long to decided


That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted all right to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?


The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said "Thank You ladies, if you hear from him let us know"


Well the weeks went by and
Spring turned to Summer
And Summer faded into Fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all


So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause...


Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl
Hey


Well hey, hey, hey
Aw, hey, hey, hey
Well hey, hey, hey

Put on that sundress
The yellow one that's a little see-through
When that sunlight hits it right
Now I'm just saying
There's nothing like leaving just a little to my imagination
Girl, all those hollywood babies ain't got nothing
Got nothing on you
Well girl, you may not believe me
But what I say is true
When I look at you
I see my baby on a magazine, cover girl. Oh yeah
You don't need makeup
You're beautiful the way god made you
He really must have took his time
The best part about you is
How you act like you don't know it
It makes me want you even more
Girl, all those hollywood babies ain't got nothing, got nothing on you
Well girl, you may not believe me
But what I say is true
When I look at you

I see my baby on a magazine
Cover girl. Oh yeah
But don't be shy
Show me what your mama gave you
Girl you got it going on
Girl, all those hollywood babies ain't got nothing
Got nothing on you
Well girl, you may not believe me
But what I say is true
When I look at you
What I say is true
When I look at you
I see my baby on a magazine
Cover girl. Oh yeah
Whoa, whoa, no no no no..
Whoa , whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, no no no no
Whoa, whoa


There's a painting hanging somewhere in Paris
Millions come over to stare at her
But she won't crack a smile, no
An Italian tower leaning like
It's had too much to drink
Still selling tickets like it's goin' out of style


When I look at you
I know there's nothing to improve
Because you're perfect girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Every little move
And every little groove
Makes me sing
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This world would change a lot about you baby if it could
But looking through the glass that I'm seein' through
I wouldn't change a thing about, a thing about you


Well, I go too fast, think too slow, I change like the weather
I know you could do better
I don't know what you see
You think your hair's too short, your eyes are too green
Girl I don't know what you mean
Not that you are, but if you're asking me


When I look at you
I know there's nothing to improve
Because you're perfect girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Every little move
And every little groove
Makes me sing
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This world would change a lot about you baby if it could
But looking through the glass that I'm seein' through
I wouldn't change a thing about, a thing about you


Every little imperfection only makes you you
And when I look at you, there's nothing to improve
You're perfect girl


When I look at you
I know there's nothing to improve
Because you're perfect girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And every little move
And every little groove
Makes me sing
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This world would change a lot about you baby if it could
But looking through the glass that I'm seein' through
I wouldn't change a thing about, a thing about you


I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't change a thing

Hooooo, ooo

Hello, is anyone there?
Did you notice, I cut my hair?
You used to like it like this
Hey, how 'bout those Braves
And how 'bout a kiss?

I'm shakin', I'm so afraid
Your heart is lightyears away
And you're just starin' through me
Looking for more
What do you see?

Just over there
The grass is so green
And out of my reach, (second time: And out of your reach)
Lay all of your dreams
You're certain to find, (second time: You're lookin' to find), (third time: The love of your life)
Your destiny
But what if it's me?

Who was the one all along?
The greatest thing you did wrong
You've gotta see for yourself
If there's somebody else

CHORUS

I don't know what else to say
You're gonna leave anyway

But if it's all a mistake
And you want me someday
I hope it's not too late.....

CHORUS

I got southern comfort runnin' through my veins
My mama was the wind
And my daddy was the train
I'm the second coming of the midnight rider
I'm a modern-day, old soul singer
Son of a gun and guitar slinger

Spent ten years pickin' on a six string
Working the bar seed, burnin' it down to the ground
Lookin' for a sound that ain't been found by no one else
Stickin' true to myself

So I took it up the highway south bound interstate
Counting on a big break, trickin' my licks for tips
Learning to live like I never did
I was dead broke like a bad joke

Chorus:
I got southern comfort runnin' through my veins
My mama was the wind
And my daddy was the train
I'm the second coming of the midnight rider
I'm a modern-day, old soul singer
Son of a gun and guitar slinger

I thought I found the right thing sittin' in the wrong town
Out in the crowd, throwin' all the signs with her eyes
Looking mighty fine in the light of a honky tonk
Just singing along

But I never had the chance 'cause after the last song
We had to get along down the road with the show
Doing it again with new friends under the spotlight

Chorus:
I got southern comfort runnin' through my veins
My mama was the wind
And my daddy was the train
I'm the second coming of the midnight rider
I'm a modern-day, old soul singer
Son of a gun and guitar slinger

I got southern comfort runnin' through my veins
My mama was the wind
And my daddy was the train
I'm the second coming of the midnight rider
I'm a modern-day, old soul singer
Son of a gun and guitar slinger

I got southern comfort runnin' through my veins
I'm the second coming of the midnight rider
I'm a modern-day, old soul singer

Does my touch mean as much as it used to?
When the passion of our love was still new?
Though time can chill a heart
Oh I'm burning for you still
But Baby, I've forgotten how you feel

Its been so long since I've heard you say you need me
Its hard to hear it when he never talk at all
Silence is heartache there's just one way to heal
Cause baby, I've forgotten how you feel

Tell me that your love has stood the test of time
Tell me that forever your heart is mine
Baby won't you hold me until I know your love is real?
Cause Baby, I've forgotten how you feel

Tell me that your love has stood the test of time
Tell me that forever your heart is mine
Baby won't you hold me until I know your love is real?
Cause Baby, I've forgotten how you feel

Baby won't you hold me until I know your love is real?
Cause Baby, I've forgotten how you feel
Yeah Baby, I've forgotten how you feel


Alright, alright
Yeah, it is alright, alright


And I don't need no five star reservations
I got spaghetti and a cheap bottle of wine
I don't need no concert in the city
I got a stereo and the 'Best Of Patsy Cline'


Ain't got no caviar, no Dom Perignon
But as far as I can see I got everything I want


Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it is alright by me


Maybe later on we will walk down to the river
Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you


May be a simple life but that's okay, yeah
If you ask me baby, I think I've got it made


Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it is alright by me


When I lay down at night I thank the lord above
For giving me everything I ever could dream of


Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it is alright by me


You said you only had time for one drink
But that dress that you're wearing says a whole 'nother thing
You laugh and you smile and you wink
Got my head spinning 'round like a roller rink
It's going places we've never been
And it's getting better with every tonic and gin
Got a Hollywood glow on your skin
Wearin' that "I will if you will" grin


How are we not supposed to crawl to the next bar
Make out on the dance floor
Take it too far out the back door
Leave an open tab, when you look like that?
And tell me how am I supposed to keep my hands to myself
When you're making my mind wander somewhere else?
It's on a one-way track when you look like that


How am I supposed to play it cool
With that sexy, adorable way you move?
I love watching you break your own rules
Come on, let me help you break a few


How are we not supposed to crawl to the next bar
Make out on the dance floor
Take it too far out the back door
Leave an open tab, when you look like that?
And tell me how am I supposed to keep my hands to myself
When you're making my mind wander somewhere else?
It's on a one-way track when you look like that


Like a couple million bucks, a bombshell deluxe
Girl, you got it all together, why you messing me up?
I'm seeing you and me as the honkey tonk dream
Saying, "Girl, we're on a roll"


And how are we not supposed to take another lap around the block
And make a pit stop, your place, my place, any place?
Wanna make it last when you look like
When you look like that, yeah


When you look like that, baby
When you look, when you look like that, whoa
You just do something to my soul, I just can't describe it
When you look like that, hoo
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
You drive me crazy when you, when you look like
Just like that right there


You're not sure that you love me but you're not sure enough to let me go
Baby, it ain't fair you know to just keep me hangin' 'round
You say you don't wanna hurt me, don't want to see my tears
So why are you still standing here just watching me drown?


And it's all right, yeah, I'll be fine
Don't worry 'bout this heart of mine
Just take your love and hit the road
There's nothing you can do or say
You're gonna break my heart anyway
So just leave the pieces when you go


Now you can drag out the heartache or, baby, you could make it quick
Really get it over with and just let me move on
Don't concern yourself with this mess you've left for me
I can clean it up, you see, just as long as you're gone


And it's all right, yeah, I'll be fine
Don't worry 'bout this heart of mine
Just take your love and hit the road
There's nothing you can do or say
You're gonna break my heart anyway
So just leave the pieces when you go


Your not making up your mind is killing me and wasting time
I need so much more than that
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


And it's all right, yeah, I'll be fine
Don't worry 'bout this heart of mine
Just take your love and hit the road
There's nothing you can do or say
You're gonna break my heart anyway
So just leave the pieces when you go


Leave the pieces when you go
Oh, yeah
Leave the pieces when you go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Leave the pieces when you go

He works way too much for way too little
He drinks way too early till way too late
He hasn't had a raise since New Year's Day
In eighty-eight gets trampled on by everyone
Except when he comes in here
And he's the product of the Haggard generation
He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated
He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook
He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam
Says he lost his brother there

He yells out Johnny Cash
And the band starts to play
A ring of fire as he walks up
And stands there by the stage
And he says

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good and love was easy

She's got an MBA and a plush corner office
She's got a don't mess with me attitude
She'll close a deal she don't reveal that she can feel
The loneliness the emptiness
Except when she comes in here
She's the product of the Me generation
She's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitated
She got the tattoo there on her derriere from a spring break dare
In Panama where love was all she thought she'd ever need

She yells out to the band
Know any Bruce Springsteen
Then she jumps up on the bar
And she, and she starts to scream
She says

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good and love was easy

Yeah, yeah
Can or can't you get my mind off thinkin' 'bout
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Hey, hell yeah

Hell yeah
Turn it up
Right on
Hell yeah
Sounds good
Sing that song
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good and love was easy

You crawl back tonight saying you miss me
With your tail between your legs
What's going on here ain't no mystery
Still, it's fun watching you beg

Settling down won't come natural
But think it over

I hear you found someone who's true
That she treats you fine
Now that poor girl's love won't do
And you're wanting some of mine

Settling down won't come natural
But think it over

I know why you cheat on me
Always running 'round and 'round
Every time I turn my back
You'll never change

Every woman loves a bit differently
But hurts the same
That's what keeps you going
That's what keeps you trapped

Don't tell me you've learned your lesson
Unless you really want to quit
It takes more than a confession
For an old dog to learn new tricks

Settling down won't come natural
But think it over
Think it over


Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way


Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it doesn't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise


Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away


Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise


This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be


Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise


Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise


Hank Williams sang it
Number 3 drove it
Chuck Berry twanged it
Will Faulkner wrote it
Aretha Franklin sold it
Dolly Parton graced it
Rosa Parks rode it
Scarlett O chased it


Smooth as the hickory wind
That blows from Memphis
Down to Appalachicola
It's hi ya'll did ya eat well
Come on in I'm
Sure glad to know ya
Don't let this old gold cross
An' this Allman Brothers t-shirt throw you
It's cicadas making noise
With the southern voice


Hank Aaron smacked it
Michael Jordan dunked it
Pocahantas tracked it
Jack Daniels drunk it
Tom Petty rocked it
Dr. King paved it
Bear Bryant won it
Billy Graham saved it


Smooth as the hickory wind
That blows from Memphis
Down to Appalachicola
It's hi ya'll did ya eat well
Come on in I'm
Sure glad to know ya
Don't let this old gold cross
An' this Crimson Tide t-shirt throw ya
It's cicadas making noise
With the southern voice


Jesus is my friend
America is my home
Sweet iced tea and Jerry Lee
Daytona Beach
That's what gets to me
I can feel it in my bones


Smooth as the hickory wind
That blows from Memphis
Down to Appalachicola
It's hi ya'll did ya eat well
Come on in child, I'm
Sure glad to know ya
Don't let this old gold cross
An' this Charlie Daniels t-shirt throw ya
It's cicadas making noise
With the southern voice


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Southern Voice
I got a southern voice
A southern voice


Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, they say it ain't that hard
But just puttin' one foot in front of the other ain't gettin' me too far
This movin' on ain't comin' along the way they said it would


I guess whoever said "the grass is greener" must've never seen the other side
And "what don't kill you makes you stronger" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new”
Must've never met you


Must've never heard you say you'd never leave me then watch you walk away
Must've never fell as hard as I did 'cause then they wouldn't say
"Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone"


I guess whoever said "the grass is greener" must've never seen the other side
And "what don't kill you makes you stronger" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new"
Must've never met you
Must've never met you


"Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone"


I guess whoever said "the grass is greener"
Must've never seen the other side
"What don't kill you makes you stronger"
Still sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world, you know she ain't the only girl"
"You win, you lose, you find somebody new"
Must've never met you
Must've never met you

Come they told me
Pa, rum, pum, pum, pum
A new born King to see
Pa, rum, pum, pum, pum
Our finest gifts we bring

Rum, pum, pum, pum
Rum, pum, pum, pum

Shall I play for you

Mary nodded

The ox and lamb kept time
Pa, rum, pum, pum, pum
I played my drum for Him
Pa, rum, pum, pum
I played my best for Him
Pa, rum, pum, pum, pum
Rum, pum, pum, pum
Rum, pum, pum, pum

Then he smiled at me
Pa rum, pum, pum, pum
Me and my drum

Oh, Me and my drum

Joy to the world

Me and my drum
Me and my drum
Me and my drum...


Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on 49
Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile


And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard


Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime


Temperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimming hole
It's nice and cold

Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs


And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard


Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime


The more things change
The more they stay the same
Don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yeah baby when you got


Two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle Rollin on the floorboard


Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime


If ever I get lost in your eyes tonight
Please just let me stay right there a little bit longer
Underneath the stars, we are on fire
And I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go


We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm telling you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight


I just wanna linger like this on your lips
And taste the salt air on your skin
Hold you in my hands
Anything and everything, you know that I'm all in


We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm telling you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah
Let's just stay right here tonight

'Cause I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while

I'm telling you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah
Let's just stay right here tonight

There's one around my finger
One around my coffee cup
One around the hands of time
And that big orange ball a comin' up
There's one around my eight to five
Four beneath me when I drive
An extra one for overtime circles
There'll be one in the hugs around my legs
And one around my waist
And one around the table holdin' hands and sayin' grace

(Chorus)
I thank God for circles
For you for me for family and friends
I thank God for circles
May they go 'round and 'round and never have to end

There's one around the block
There's always one around the bend
Any to and from you go
And back again
Some are green and some are golden
Summer turns to winter cold
And into spring the seasons roll circles
There'll be one around the candles
One around the birthday cakes
One around the table holdin' hands and sayin' grace

(Chorus)
I thank God for circles
For you for me for family and friends
I thank God for circles
May they go 'round and 'round and never have to end

(Bridge)
There's one around the world
That goes around so we can see it all
One around the halo
When we're called

(Chorus)
I thank God for circles
For you for me for family and friends
I thank God for circles
May they go 'round and 'round and never have to end
I thank God for family circles, may we find and have so many more of them


Don't ... don't you wish we'd tried?
Do you feel what I feel inside?
You know our love is stronger than pride
Don't ... no, don't
Don't let your anger grow
Just tell me what you need me to know
Please talk to me—don't close the door
‘Cause I want to hear you ... want to be near you


Don't fight ... don't argue
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away ... don't tell me to go


Don't ... don't give up on trust
Don't give up on me—on us
If we could just hold on long enough
We can do it ... we'll get through it




Don't pretend that it's okay
Things won't get better that way
And don't do something you might regret someday
Don't ... don't give up on me
Don't ...
We can do it ... we'll get through it

He pushed me 'round
Now I'm drawin' the line
He lived his life
Now I'm gonna go live mine
I'm sick of wastin' my time
Well now I've been good for way too long
Found my red dress and I'm gonna throw it on
'Bout to get too far gone


Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Need a little bit more of my twelve ounce nutrition
One more helpin' of what I've been havin'
I'm takin' my turn on the sin wagon


On a mission to make something happen
Feel like Delilah lookin' for Samson
Do a little mattress dancin'
That's right I said mattress dancin'


Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Need a little bit more
Of what I've been missin'
I don't know where I'll be crashin'
But I'm arrivin' on a sin wagon


When it's my turn to march up to old glory
I'm gonna have one hell of a story
That's if he forgives me
Oh, lord please forgive me


Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Need a little bit more of that sweet salvation
They may take me
With my feet draggin'
But I'll fly away on a sin wagon
I'll fly away on a sin wagon


You might be a redneck ...
(radio static)
The Grand Ole Opry coming to you live from ...
(radio static)


When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton
The first time you leave it can be strange, it can be shockin'
Not everybody drives a truck, not everybody drinks sweet tea
Not everybody owns a gun, wears a ball cap, boots, and jeans
Not everybody goes to church
Or watches every NASCAR race
Not everybody knows the words to
"Ring Of Fire" or "Amazing Grace"


Oh, Dixie Land
I hope you understand
When I miss my Tennessee home
And I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone


I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights
I know what it's like to be the only one like me
To take a good hard look around and be a minority


And I miss my Tennessee home
I can see the ways that I've grown
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone


I miss your biscuits and your gravy
Fireflies dancing in the night
You have fed me, you have saved me
Billy Graham and Martha White
I have since become a drifter
And I just can't wait to pack
Cause I know the route I leave on
It will always bring me back




I wish I was in Dixie Again
I miss my Tennessee Home
I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone


Look away, look away

I wish I was in Dixie, away, look away


I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today


Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again


I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today


Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty señoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Going to lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play


Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends

Because my bartender, she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum


I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today


Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the muchachas, they call me big papa
When I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger
And I'll grab my guitar and play
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay
The señoritas don't care when there's no dinero
Yeah, I got no money to stay


Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay


I'm just going to drive up by the lake
And put my ass in a lawn chair, toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world, a PBR on the way
Life is good today, life is good today


All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good ol' boys like me
I don't wanna be the one to tell 'em
That stuff that they've been selling
Ain't working like it should
But I damn sure wish it would


Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey


Maybe it's the bar or the stool I'm on
Maybe it's the band and the sad old song
That keeps me buying rounds
That keeps me turning down
Any girl that wants to dance
And you ain't giving them a chance


Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey


Girl, I'm living proof that 80 proof
Ain't got a shot at touching you


But whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
Yeah the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey


All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good old boys like me


Oh why you look so sad
The tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don’t be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
Cause I’ve seen the dark side too


When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less


I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
Won’t let nobody hurt you
I’ll stand by you


So if you're mad get mad
Don’t hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide
I get angry too
Well I’m a lot like you


When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
Cause even if you're wrong


I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
Won’t let nobody hurt you
I’ll stand by you
Take me in into you darkest hour
And I’ll never desert you
I’ll stand by you


And when, when the night falls on you, baby
You feeling all alone
You won't be on your own


I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
Won’t let nobody hurt you
I’ll stand by you
Take me in into you darkest hour
And I’ll never desert you
I’ll stand by you


Oh I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my momma and me and then
Spin me around till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I new for sure, I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again

When me and my momma would disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Then finally make me do just what my momma said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear my momma cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more

I know I'm praying for much too much
But could you send back the only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But dear lord she's dying to dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream...

Every mornin' when I get up
Jet fuel in a coffee cup
Lord knows I ain't givin' up
Gonna take on the world today

Sometimes it's green, green grass
Other times it kicks my ass
Half-full, half-empty glass
Don't matter either way

I'm gonna live the life that I'm gonna live
It ain't what I thought it was
But it is what it is, baby

This ain't no rodeo
No dog and pony show
Ain't no roller-coaster ride
Ain't no highway
Sure ain't no river, baby
It's just my so called
Just my so called life

Some days I own this town
Other days it shoots me down
As long as I'm still hangin' 'round
I'm holdin' on to hope

Faith is a powerful thing
Chasin' after the big brass ring
Might be a pocket full of jing-a-ling
But there's one thing that I know

Ya just gotta keep keepin' on doin' like ya do
You look around when it's said and done
And realize that it's true, baby

This ain't no rodeo
No dog and pony show
Ain't no roller-coaster ride
Ain't no highway
Sure ain't no river, baby
It's just my so called
Just my so called life

My so called...

This ain't no rodeo
No dog and pony show
Ain't no roller-coaster ride, yeah!
Ain't no highway
Sure ain't no river, baby
It's just my so called
Just my so called life

My so called...


I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working spitting hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasing up the other day
And an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought oh good lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile


Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives


There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide


It ain't where
It's how you live
We weren't raised to take
We were raised to give
The shirt off our back
To anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And all Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive


Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives


There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide


Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives


There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide


There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide


I was ten years old the day I got caught
With some dime store candy that I never bought
I hung my head and I faced the wall
As Daddy showed me wrong from right
He said this hurts me more than it does you
There's just some things son, that you just don't do
Is anything I'm sayin' getting through
Said Daddy I can see the light


Oh, lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it, 'cause this world turns
Oh, lessons learned


Granddaddy was a man I loved
He bought me my first ball and glove
Even taught me how to drive his truck
Circling that ol' town square
He spoke of life with a slow southern drawl
I never heard him cause I knew it all
But I sure listened when I got the call
That he was no longer there


Oh, lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it, 'cause this world turns
Oh, lessons learned




Oh, lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it, 'cause this world turns
Oh, lessons learned

Here's some things about me you might wanna know
I'm gonna tell you even if you don't
I come from the country, I still been to town
An' I like dogs but just not in the house
But I might skip church one Sunday
To catch the football game
But I'll give twice as much next week
When they pass the offerin' plate

I'm just ordinary on most days,.
Extraordinary on my best
I got a good job, but the way I spend money
I never have any left
Hey, I drink too much coffee
An' I'm always runnin' late
I was born a sinner
But my Momma thinks I'm a saint

I've had my share of heartaches, bounced a couple checks
I had a wife, but now I've got an ex
No, I won't never be the President, hel,l I barely finished school
But I know Justin sings lead for N'Sync, so my kids think I'm cool

I'm just ordinary on most days,.
Extraordinary on my best
I got a good job, but the way I spend money
I never have any left
I drink too much coffee
An' I'm always runnin' late
But I was born a sinner
But my Momma thinks I'm a saint

I know there are some who live life differently
But there's a lot more people who are just like me

Ordinary on most days
Extraordinary on my best
I got a good job, but the way I spend money
I never have any left
Yeah, I drink too much coffee
An' I'm always runnin' late
I was born a sinner
But my Momma thinks I'm a saint

Yeah, I was born a sinner
But my Momma thinks I'm a saint

I never had all the answers
I never had enough time
But I sure had all the reasons
Why you weren't what I wanted to find

I never laid all my cards out
You just wanted to play
The king he waited on my doorsteps
While the joker and me went on our way

Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
'Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

These days everything is all business
Never in one place for too long
But there's no lack of arms around me
But I still wonder if somewhere I went wrong

Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
'Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee
In Tennessee

And I'd wish on every star in the
Southern sky
For that man and our life
If I did not think that

Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
'Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

Yes, I guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee


I had a one night stand with my best friend's baby sister
And to this day he still won't speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline
I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had wrung my neck
When she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack


If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all
I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd've changed a lot of things
Starting with me


I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks around here would die for
By laying out all night and raising hell
And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standing by the bed
When the preacher bowed his head
With the family, the day my grandma die




What if the moment came and
You knew your life was down to minutes
A lighters flame was all you had to see
And you found a pen and torn up piece of paper
And a note was all you could leave
13 men felt trapped in a mine in West Virginia
Only one made it out alive
But there love lives on in the words
I can not wait to see you on the other side


What would you say
What would you say


In the lines on a page from the life that you made
Could you write it with no regrets
Would you know in yourself you gave somebody else
All the love that you had inside
Right down to your last prayer


Would you tell your momma thank you for the way you love me
Daddy don't cry everything's gonna be ok
Would you tell your little boy that
You'll be watching him from up in heaven
You'll never miss one game


What would you say
What would you say


In the lines on a page from the life that you made
Could you write it with no regrets
Would you know in yourself you gave somebody else
All the love that you had inside
Right down to your last prayer
What would you say

In the lines on a page from the life that you made
Could you write it with no regrets
Would you know in yourself you gave somebody else
All the love that you had inside
Right down to your last prayer

What if the moment came and


There's a place in your heart where nobody's been
Take me there
Things nobody knows, not even your friends
Take me there
Tell me about your momma, your daddy, your home town, show me around
I wanna see it all, don't leave anything out


I want to know, everything about you
And I want to go, down every road you've been
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live, where you keep the rest of your life hid
I want to know the girl behind that pretty stare
Take me there


Your first real kiss, your first true love, you were scared
Show me where
You learned about life, spent your summer nights, without a care
Take me there
I wanna roll down mainstreet and backroads like you did when you were a kid
What makes you who you are, tell me what your story is



I want to know, everything about you
And I want to go, down every road you've been
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live, where you keep the rest of your life hid
I want to know the girl behind that pretty stare
Take me there

I want to know, everything about you
And I want to go, down every road you've been
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live, where you keep the rest of your life hid
I want to know the girl behind that pretty stare
Take me there


I want to roll down mainstreet
I want to know your hopes and your dreams
Take me, take me there
Yeah


I've been thinking 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back
Oh, won't you let me take it back


I know I told you that I don't love you
And I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back


Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby I was wrong


What I won't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah
If I had you right here right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you


Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
And I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong


Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, she was a seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, she'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand


Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad


Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the song
The words she knows, the tune she hums


But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly


Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today


Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, she was a seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, yeah she married a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her, she was dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand


Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

And hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today




You're crashin' into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you to stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We've got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Tryin' to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight


We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria


Wreckin' ball dancin' down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss


We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria


Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around


We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Oh


Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around


Friday night and it's snowing outside
I'm all alone here watching it fall
TV's on but the sounds turned down
Somehow I knew he'd know to call right now
I oughta just let it ring
Because every time it's the damn thing


Why is he always got to be calling me when I'm lonely?
It's so wrong to be leading me on and I can't say no
He swears that it's going to be different this time, but it won't be
Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?


He left a message saying he was only fifteen minutes away
And that's just enough time for me to figure out if I should stay or leave
But if I think it through
I ain't got nothing better than you


Why is he always got to be calling me when I'm lonely?
It's so wrong to be leading me on and I can't say no
He swears that it's going to be different this time, but it won't be
Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?


Hes at the front door now
With his magic smile
And hell be gone tomorrow
But right now hes mine for a little while


Why is he always got to be calling me when I'm lonely?
It's so wrong to be leading me on and I can't say no
He swears that it's going to be different this time, but it won't be
Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?


Why is he always got to be calling me when I'm lonely?

If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in
A world with no air
Oh

I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
If there was a way that I can
Make you understand

But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
Be so hard for me to breathe

( Chorus )
Tell me how I'm supposed to
Breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air, air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to
Hold me down from you

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how, but I don't even care

So how do you expect me
To live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

( Chorus )
Tell me how I'm supposed to
Breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
No air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
No air, no air

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No more
No air, no air

( Chorus )
Tell me how I'm supposed to
Breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

( Chorus )
Tell me how I'm supposed to
Breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air, air

If I hadn't dropped the ball, I would've took it all the way
Homecoming '89 with ten seconds left to play
We were drivin' toward the goal line, they were screamin' in the stands
I had the chance to be a hero, but it slipped right through my hands
There would've been a big pep rally, the would've hung my jersey on the wall
If I hadn't dropped the ball
Me and Cindy Miller were supposed to meet after the game
I waited by the bleachers, but she never came
I found a note on my windshield underneath the wiper blade
With goodbye bleedin' through it in the cold October rain
We probably would've gotten married
And those recruiters in from 'Bama would've called
If I hadn't dropped the ball

(Chorus:)
My life would've been so different if in that instant
Things had gone the way I planned
But the fact is that they didn't, and the hand I wound up getting
Is something that i'll never understand
I ran away that summer, took a job out on the coast
And that's where I met your mama, and the rest I guess you know
If I had the chance to go back and score that last touchdown
Well, son, I wouldn't do it, 'cause you wouldn't be here now
And I wouldn't be your hero, I wouldn't be around to catch you when you fall
If I hadn't dropped the ball

(Chorus:)
My life would've been so different if in that instant
Things had gone the way I planned
But the fact is that they didn't and the hand I wound up getting
Is the one that god intended me to have
No, I wouldn't be the man I am at all
If I hadn't dropped the ball


She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It had been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air


Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel


It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight


Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel


Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel


Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, wow, oh


Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide-awake just watching you sleep
And I promise you you're going to have
More than just the things that you need
We have not got much now, we’re just starting out
But I know somehow paradise is coming


Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's going to shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life


Oh now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But baby someday we're going to fly
This road we're on, you know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters


Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life


So hold on, hold on
Come on baby, hold on
Yeah, we're gonna have it all
And ooh


Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life


Oh, a better life
Hey we're going to leave this all behind us baby, wait and see
We're headed for a better life, you and me
We're going to break the chains that bind and, finally we'll be free
We're going to be the ones that have it all, you and me
Just hold on tight now baby

We were 18, it was prom night
We had our first big fight
She said "Pull this car over"
I did and then I told her, "I don't know what you are crying for"
I grabbed her hand, as she reached for the door

She said, I'll walk
Let go of my hand
Right now I'm hurt, and you don't understand
So just be quiet
And later we will talk
Just leave, don't worry. I'll walk

It was a dark night, a black dress
Driver never saw her, around the bend
I never will forget the call, or driving to the hospital
When they said her legs still wouldn't move
I cried, when I walked into her room

She said, I'll walk
Please come and hold my hand
Right now I'm hurt, and I don't understand
Lets just be quiet, and later we can talk
Please stay, don't worry. I'll walk

I held her hand through everything
The weeks and months of therapy
And I held her hand and asked her, to be my bride
She's dreamed from a little girl, to have her daddy bring her down the aisle
So from her wheelchair, she looks up to him and smiles

And says, I'll walk
Please hold my hand
I know that this will hurt, I know you understand
Please daddy don't cry
This is already hard
Let's go, don't worry
I'll walk

Its three in the morning on a saturday night the laundry and
Dishes just ain't worth the fight
Headlights are dancing across the living room wall that long distant
Higway just echoes the hall
Now the babies are sleeping on back in their room and he's been passed
Out on the sofa since noon
Nobody told her about none of these things and god knows she'd leave
There if heartaches had wings

Chorus:
If heartaches had wings she would fly
Away like some bird through the night
Its a long long way from a young girl's dreams
But she surely leave there if
Heartaches had wings

She grew up believing that wishes come true
A knight on a white horse like some young girls do
So she married her the captain of the school football team
Just like she was supposed to as homecoming queen

Chorus x1

She turns out the lights and she lays down in bed
Sound of that highway still runs through her head
She closes her eyes and she whispers those prayers
And falls asleep wondering does anyone care

Chorus x


Sometimes it feels like, I'm gonna break
Sometimes this world, gives more than I can take
Sometimes, sunshine gets lost in the rain
And it keeps pouring down
It just keeps coming down


This life would kill me If I didn't have you
I couldn't live without you baby
I wouldn't want to
If you didn't love me so much
I'd never make it through
Cause this life would kill me
This life would kill me if I didn't have you


You are my heart, every breath I breathe
I'm safe in your arms, you rescue me
When I'm weak, you're strong
If you were gone I don't know where I'd be
You were made for me
You were made for me




If you didn't love me so much
If you didn't love me so much
This Life would kill me If I didn't have you
This life would kill me


Couldn't live without you baby
I wouldn't want to
If you didn't love me so much
I'd never make it through
Cause This life would kill me
This Life would kill me if I didn't have you

Blowing out the candles
On another birthday cake
Old enough to look back and laugh at my mistakes
Young enough to look at the future and like what I see
My best days are ahead of me

Life hasn't always been a party
But mostly it's been good
There's only one or two things that I'd change if I could
I dont get lost in the past or get stuck in some sad memory yah
My best days are ahead of me

Age is nothing but a number
Sometimes I have to wonder
What does it really mean
But heeeey im still putting it together
I keep getting better
If I keep getting better
I can be whatever I want to be
My best days are ahead of me

Age is nothing but a number
Sometimes I have to wonder
What does it really mean
But heeeey im still putting it together
I keep getting better
If I keep getting better
I can be whatever I want to be
My best days are ahead of me

I've got sunsets to witness
Dreams to dance with
Beaches to walk on
And lovers to kiss
There's a whole lot of world out there
That I can't wait to see
My best days are ahead of me


I know your leaving I see the signs
Your going to walk out on this heart of mine
You'll never call me, you'll never write
You made your mind up and your gone to night
If some rainy day your all alone
And feel like talking you can log me on


At www dot memory
I'll be waiting for you patiently
If you feel the need just click on me
At www dot memory


You won't even have to hold me or look into my eyes
You can tell me that you love me
Through your keyboard and wires
Though you won't have to touch me or even take my hand
Just slide your little mouse around until you see it land




If you feel the need just click on me
At www dot memory


I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35's, pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer, yeah!


All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!


Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country right hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!


All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!


My kinda-- your kind-- is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh oh oh oh oh, gonna get our love on
Oh oh oh oh oh, time to get our buzz on


All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!


Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
That’s my kind of night!
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
Come on


I've sure enjoyed the rain
But I'm looking forward to the sun
You have to feel the pain
When you lose the love you gave someone
I thought by now the time
Would take away these lonely tears
I hope you're doing fine all alone
But where do I go from here, 'cause...


Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you


Well I never thought I'd be lying here without you by my side
It seems unreal to me that the life you promised was a lie
You made it look so easy
Making love into memories
I guess you got what you wanted
But what about me, 'cause...


Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you


Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart
That I'm better off without you
Because baby, I can't live


Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you


Why do you keep on staring?
That mirror, mirror, it ain't fair at all (mm-mm)
Dress sizes can't define, don't let the world decide what's beautiful
No


You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart


If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on


Don't follow anyone
March to the rhythm of a different drum
Why do we analyze, break out, and criticize the crazy ones?
Oh


You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart, no


If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on


Put your hands up, show me that you're one of a kind
Put your hands up, let me hear your voice tonight
Oh


If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on


Traveled on
Take the road less traveled on




Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting
I'm through with doubt
There's nothing left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep paying it


I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go round and round and round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should


I know you said
Can't you just get over it?
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it


I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over


I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go round and round and round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go round and round and round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
What it is you think I should


Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting


I'm staring at the ceiling, laying here dreaming
Wasting the day away
The world's flying by our window outside
But hey baby that's okay
This feels so right, it can't be wrong so far as I can see
Where you wanna go
Baby, I'll do anything


'Cause if you wanna go
Baby, let's go
If you wanna rock
I'm ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk
Baby, let's walk
Have a little kiss
Have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can stay here forever
Lay here forever, oh


If you want to see that Italian tower leaning
Baby, we can leave right now
If that's too far, we can head in the car
And take a little trip around town
They say that California is nice and warm this time of year
Baby, say the word and we'll just disappear


'Cause if you wanna go
Baby, let's go
If you wanna rock
I'm ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk
Baby, let's walk
Have a little kiss
Have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever, oh


Take me for a whirl
Just a boy and a girl
Letting go of it all
Holding on to one another
Or there's a whole world to discover
Right here, under the covers


'Cause if you wanna go
Baby, let's go
If you wanna rock
I'm ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk
Baby, let's walk
Have a little kiss
Have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can stay here forever
Lay here forever, oh
Let's stay here forever, oh


Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally say good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Oh the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still "good-bye-ing"
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Oh the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still "good-bye-ing"
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow (x3)


See that big blue note over there on the counter
You don't want to read that thing man
It's a real get-ya-downer
But don't you dare say nothing else bad about her
She's gone


No, no, no, no don-don't throw it away
'Cause tonight I might need it
It gets real lonely around here at night sometimes
And I have to reread it
Besides, you can show it to the boys downtown
And they won't believe that
She's gone


There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find just like that she's up and vanished
And the only thing she left behind for me


Is this big blue note folded up in my pocket
Yeah don't laugh, it's been two months I still got it
Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice
Just to make sure I ain't forgot that
She's gone


You know my psychiatrist said, "Tell me what do you see
When you look at these ink spots of reds and yellows and green?"
You know, I looked at them all, but all they looked to me like
Big blue notes


There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find just like that she's up and vanished
And the only thing that's left to do for me


Is stand high on this cliff overlooking the sea
With my big blue note paper airplane that I just set free
And I'm gonna wait here a few more minutes
And if it don't come back to me
You guessed it
She's gone


Crash landing
Bye, bye, baby


I can usually drink you right off of my mind
But I miss you tonight
I can normally push you right out of my heart
But I'm too tired to fight
Yeah the whole thing begins
And I let you sink into my veins
And I feel the pain like it's new
Everything that we were
Everything that you said
Everything that I did and that I couldn't do
Plays through tonight


Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and
Hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up


Turn the TV up loud
Just to drown out your voice
But I can't forget
Now I'm all out of ideas and baby
I'm down to my last cigarette
Yeah, you're probably asleep
Deep inside of your dreams
While I’m sitting here
Crying and trying to
See, yeah, wherever you are
Baby now I am sure you moved on
And aren't thinking twice about me
And you tonight


Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and
Hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up

I know that you're movin' on
I know I should give you up
But I keep hopin' that you'll trip
And fall back in love
Time's not healin' anything
Baby, this pain is worse than it ever was
I know that you can't hear me
But baby I need you to save me tonight


Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and
Hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up


Oh, I'm dreaming
Come wake me up
Oh, I'm dreaming

I heard from a friend of a friend of a friend that
You finally got rid of that girlfriend
You finally came out of that love coma, boy

I heard Mary Jane at the Powder Puff Beauty Shop
Sayin' that blonde in her tube top
She left our Jimmy for a boy in Illinois

Someone give me an amen
Someone give me an amen

Can I get a thank God, hallelujah?
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it, she was right
Glad to see you saw the lie

Whole town, yeah, we whooped and hollered
She drove away, nobody stopped her
Na-na, na-na-na, I'll say it again
Someone give me an amen

Yeah, right, like I really could've said something
You wouldn't have heard it if a train was coming
You had your head so high in the clouds

Oh, I, I had a really good reason
For hiding my feelings
But now I can finally spit it out

Someone give me an amen
Someone give me an amen

Can I get a thank God, hallelujah?
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it, she was right
Glad to see you saw the lie

Whole town, yeah, we whooped and hollered
She drove away, nobody stopped her
Na-na, na-na-na, I'll say it again
Someone give me an Amen

I'm standing right here in front of you
I think I love you too

Can I get a thank God, hallelujah?
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it, she was right
Glad to see you saw the lie

Whole town, yeah, we whooped and hollered
The preacher's son and the farmer's daughter
Na-na, na-na-na, I'll say it again
Someone give me an amen
Someone give me an amen
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na


Driving down the street today I saw a sign for lemonade
They were the cutest kids I'd ever seen in this front yard
As they handed me my glass, smiling thinking to myself
Man, what a picture-perfect postcard this would make of America


It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song, it's a ride in a Chevrolet
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids selling lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America


Later on when I got home, I flipped the TV on
I saw a little town that some big twister tore apart
And people came from miles around just to help their neighbours out
And I was thinking to myself I'm so glad that I live in America


It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song, it's a ride in a Chevrolet
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids selling lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America


Now we might not always get it all right
There's no place else I'd rather build my life
But Yeah, Cause it's a kid with a chance, it's a rock 'n roll band
It's a farmer cuttin' hay
It's a big flag flyin' in a summer wind
Over a fallen hero's grave


It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song
It's a welcome home parade, yeah
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids sellin' lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America! It's America! Oh, oh yeah, woo!

Gonna drive like hell through your neighbourhood
Park this Silverado on your front lawn
Crank up a little Hank
Sit on the hood and drink
I'm about to get my pissed off on

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart, baby
And drove me redneck crazy

Wish I knew how long it's been going on
How long you've been getting some on the side
Nah, he can't amount to much by the look of that little truck
Well, he won't be getting any sleep tonight

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart, baby
And drove me redneck crazy
Redneck crazy

Did you think I'd wish you both the best
Endless love and happiness?
You know that's just not the kind of man I am
Yeah, I'm the kind that shows up at your house at 3 A.M

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight
But I'm up for anything tonight
You've gone and broke the wrong heart, baby
And drove me redneck crazy
You drove me redneck crazy, oh, yeah

The kids screaming, phone ringing
Dog barking at the mailman bringing
That stack of bills - overdue
Good morning baby, how are you?
Got a half hour, quick shower
Take a drink of milk but the milk's gone sour
My funny face makes you laugh
Twist the top on and I put it back
There goes the washing machine
Baby, don't kick it.
I promise I'll fix it
Long about a million other things

Well, it's ok. It's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be
Well, it's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise

Friday, you're late
Guess we'll never make our dinner date
At the restaurant you start to cry
Baby, we'll just improvise
Well, plan B looks like
Dominoes' pizza in the candle light
Then we'll tippy toe to our room
Make a little love that's overdue
But somebody had a bad dream
Mama and daddy
Can me and my teddy
Come in to sleep in between?

Yeah it's ok. It's so nice.
It's just another day in paradise.
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be
Well, it's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise

Well, it's ok. It's so nice.
It's just another day in paradise.
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be
Two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise

For just another day in paradise
Well, it's the kids screaming. The phone ringing
Just another day
Well, it's Friday. You're late
Oh yeah, it's just another day in paradise

Well, I hear that you're doing unwell
From your smile I could never tell
You open up the door and the world pours in
All of its problems, solutions and sins
Everybody seems to have a remedy
But there ain't no remedy that's ever gonna cure me

Take it while it comes 'cause it don't last long
Hesitate and the moment's gone
Run in the rain and howl at the moon
Fall in love way too soon
Take my hand as the music starts
We'll dance to the beat of your heart
Dance

There's a distance in your eyes
Seems you been looking for a place to hide
There's nothing but love around you my child
But you can't see for your cryin' eyes
You stand in a crowd when you wanna be alone
You're your own contradiction but you're not alone

Take it while it comes 'cause it don't last long
Hesitate and the moment's gone
Run in the rain and howl at the moon
Fall in love way too soon
Take my hand as the music starts
We'll dance to the beat of your heart
Dance

You know you'll stumble down that road
Trembling from the cold
But this heart and this love can save you
It can save you

Take it while it comes 'cause it don't last long
Hesitate and the moment's gone
Run in the rain and howl at the moon
Fall in love way too soon
Take my hand as the music starts
We'll dance to the beat of your heart

And we'll dance to the beat of your heart
And we'll dance to the beat of your heart
To the beat of your heart
To the beat of your heart


I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but


Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me


I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So


Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me


Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life


So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh


And you're going to think of me
Oh yeah
Ooh someday baby, someday
Oooh ooh ooh oh
Think of me
Ooh ooh dumdum dirumdum baby

I thought it was over
I thought I could move on
But I was wrong
I woke up last night
Calling your name
Feeling the blame baby

Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love

What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you

You've got every right
To turn and walk away
I can't make you stay
I broke your heart
That's the bottom line
I wasted so much precious time, baby
I see with your friend
Wearing a smile again

What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you

Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love

What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you

Oh girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment(moment)
Without you
Ohhhh


We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill
Don't make a difference to me baby, where the wind takes me, long as I'm with you, girl
We could have something or nothing, still be sitting on top of the world


'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view


Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world


We could be rolling on a couple of Goodyears and painted rust
We could be strolling barefoot in the sand, in the setting sun
Yeah, any way you kiss me flips me and gets me the right kind of tipsy, girl
We could be somewhere or nowhere and still be sitting on top of the world


'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view


Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me

Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world


Top of the world

Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view
'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view


Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world


'Cause when you got love like we got love
Sitting on top of the world
'Cause when you got love like we got love
Sitting on top of the world
'Cause when you got love like we got love
Sitting on top of the world
'Cause when you got love like we got love
Sitting on top of the world

Roly Poly eatin' corn and taters
Hungry every minute of the day
Roly Poly gnawin' on a biscuit
As long as he can chew it it's okay

He can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye
He likes anything from soup to hay
Roly Poly
Daddy's little fatty
I bet he's going to be a man some day

(guitar solo)

Roly Poly, scarmbled eggs for breakfest
Bread and jelly twenty times a day
Roly Poly, eats a hearty dinner
He needs lots strength to sing and play

He's up at dawn to do the chores
Runs both ways to all the stores
He works up an appetite that way
Ro-oly Poly
Daddy's little fatty
Fatty's going to be a man some day


Man, I've been working too hard
Ten hour days and I'm tired
Damn this knuckle busted'
Back breakin', no paying job
Know where I'm goin from here
Hot headed women, cold beer
Kick up my heels for a little while
And do it country style


In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on


How I keep catching her eye
Man, I keep wondering why
Ain't nothing special 'bout
An "awe shucks" country boy
Lord, she's sure lookin' good
Like something from Hollywood
She got me thinkin' that I just might
Leave here with her tonight


In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on


Cause I am who I am and that's
The man I'm gonna be, yeah
And when the Lord comes callin'
Well, he ain't gonna have
To holler, y'all
There'll be no trouble finding me


In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on


With my boots on
He's gonna take me home
Lord, with my boots on


I'm a 45 spinning on an old Victrola
I'm a two-strike swinger, I'm a Pepsi Cola
I'm a blue jean quarterback saying "I love you" to the prom queen
In a Chevy
I'm John Wayne, Superman, California
I'm a Kris Kristofferson, Sunday morning
I'm a mama and daddy singing along to Don McLean
At the levee


And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16


Hey, hey
Everything I needed
That's right


I'm Mark Twain on the Mississippi
I'm Hemingway with a shot of whiskey
I'm a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune
I'm a Texaco star, I'm a Gibson guitar
I'm still a teenage kid trying to go too far
I'm a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter


And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16


I spent a lot of years running from believing
Looking for another way to save my soul
The longer I live, the more I see it
There's only one way home


And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16
Oh, I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old (never grow old)
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16


(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)
Everything I needed
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)
Everything I needed
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)
Oh, that's right

Check engine light came on in my pick up truck
So I took a piece of black tape and I covered it up
I knew there was a problem underneath the hood
But I just kept on drivin' a little faster then I should
I told myself that it would be okay
Ignore it and it'll go away

And as to be expected a few miles down the road
My really nothin's wrong here went up in smoke
Kinda like the mornin' you said,"we need to talk"
I pretended I was listenin' but I was blowin' it off
I didn't hear a thing you had to say
Ignore it and it'll go away

The problem wasn't that there was a problem
The problem was the choice that I made
Why did I choose not to notice
What was right there in my face?

I'd like to say I'm sorry,but it's a little to late for that
You've gone on with your life...I'm glad I really am
I don't know why it took me so long to realize
I don't what else to say except that I've
Learned my lesson one true love too late
Ignore it and it'll go away

Ignore it and it will go away


I move on like a sinners prayer
Letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Getting reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man


Never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way a storm blows through
I never stay, but then again, I might
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb out
But I'm honest to a fault
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man


I see you leaning, you're bound to fall
I don't want to be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer and nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late


Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinning, then you're standing still
Left holding a losing hand
But one day you're gonna find someone
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
It was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment you'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man
Better as a memory than as your man


Why you talking with them baby
How come they're sipping on ice cold beer
Why you rubbing Maybelline on them, when
You should be putting them lips right here
Them lips, right here
You should be putting them lips right here
They look lonely and need some kissing
So why you sitting way over there
Bring them on over, you got my permission baby
To get to putting them lips right here
Them lips, right here
Best get to putting them lips right here


On mine, on mine
Any other thing you're thinking about doing tonight, tonight
Wouldn't be nothing but a waste of time for them lips


Yeah we could have a short conversation
Find things in common that we both share
But baby that's just procrastination
Cut to the chase and put your lips right here




Just so there's no misunderstanding
I want to make this crystal clear
You see this big smile smiling back at you babe
Well I want you to put your lips right here
Them lips right here
I want you to put your lips right here
Them lips go right here baby
I want you to put your lips right here
Put them here


Yeah this place is wall to wall, can't barely move, takes fifteen minutes just to get a drink
It's crazy here, this crowd tonight's so loud in here you can hardly think
But everything's fading babe, cause you're all I see
It's like we're alone in here baby


We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island


It's just me and you, back corner booth, we're sitting on the same seat
Got my hands all over you and, yeah girl, you're all over me
Like nobody's watching us baby, let them all see
Still that ain't stopping us baby


We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island


We might as well be on an island
Like we're the last two on this Earth
Like we're frozen here in time
Like it's empty here tonight


We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island, yeah


In these last few days
You've been on my mind
We should get together
And talk about the old times
And put the past behind us
Before life slips away
I've been thinkin' about you


In these last few days


I have felt my age
I wish that I was younger
But time has turned the page
I sure miss the water
And the rhythm of the waves
I've been feelin' fragile




I have bee a faster
A husband and a son
Lookin' back is bittersweet
Now that my face has run
I've tired to be a witness
From the cradle to the grave
Time has felt so precious




I have seen the light
I'll be waiting for you
On the other side
My old friend, I love you
Is really all that's left to say
Lay down here beside me




My old friend, I'll miss you
But I'm trying to be brave
Lay down here beside me
In these last few days


Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that come get me look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild


Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me


She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says 'let's stay on the couch and watch TV'
And she falls asleep


Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me


She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah I'm such a fool for her


Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me

I learned how to write it when I first started school
Some bully didn't like it, he said it didn't sound to cool
So I had to hit him and all I said when the blood came
It's my last name


Grandpa took of to Europe to fight the Germans in the war
It came back on some dog tags nobody wears no more
It's written on a headstone in the field where he was slain
It's my last name


Passed down from generations too far back to trace
I can see all my relations when I look into my face
May never make it famous but I'll never bring it shame
It's my last name

{Verse 3}
Daddy always told me far back as I recall
Son, your part of something, you represent us all
So keep it how you got it , as solid as it came
It's my last name




So darling if you're wondering why I've got you here tonight
I want to be your husband, I want you to be my wife
I ain't got much to give you but what I've got means everything
It's my last name, oh, it's my last name


I learned how to write it when I first started school

Da Da Da Da, Da Da Da
I have wondered this world
Far and wide
I've been all around to the other side
But theres nothing like coming home
Nothing like coming home

I wanna sit on my front porch
And drink my lemonade
Cut my grass after church every sunday
And Go out saturday night
And live the simple life
Wake up in the mornig to these fields of gold
Take a long walk down a gravel road

Chorus
Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that i'll always have someone to hold
Oh i wanna live the simple life, yeah

I wanna take a blanket down to the creek
And let the water sing me to sleep
And let go in time
Live the simple life..
Well lately i've seen too many city lights
I wanna go somewhere where i can see the stars at night

Chorus

Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that i'll always have someone to hold
Oh i wanna live the simple life, yeah yeah

Chorus

Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing, and watch my babies grow
Know that I'll always have some, someone to hold
Oh, Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that I'll always have someone to hold
Oh I wanna live the simple life
Oh I wanna live the simple life
Da Da Da Da, Da Da Da Da..
Mm That's Right


The first time I looked in your eyes I knew
That I would do anything for you
The first time you touched my face I felt
Like I've never felt with anyone else


I wanna give back what you've giving to me
And I wanna witness all of your dreams
Now that you've shown me who I really am
I wanna be more than just your man


I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
And be the hand that lifts your veil
And be the moon that moves your tide
The sun coming up in your eyes
Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of and more
So much more, I wanna be your everything


When you wake up, I'll be the first thing you see
And when it gets dark you can reach out for me
I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts
And I'll be your compass baby, when you get lost


I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
And be the hand that lifts your veil
And be the moon that moves your tide
The sun coming up in your eyes
Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of and more
So much more, I wanna be your everything


Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of and more
So much more, I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your everything


I saw a truck backing out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messing with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldn’t believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whispering
A tear in your eye says I should have been listening


Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?


You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I aren’t leaving till I hear you say what’s going on
It’ll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I’m gone


Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?


No goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No, don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Is someone else calling you baby?


Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?


I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love


Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?


I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love


And the greatest is love
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

Don't know why I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do zero to sixty in five point two

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

Can't be late, I leave in plenty of time
Shakin' hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

Oh, I hear a voice
That says I'm running behind
Better pick up my pace
It's a race and there ain't no room for someone in second place

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die B
Ut I'm in a hurry and don't know why

She let me dance real close
She let me buy the beer
So I thought I'd whisper something sexy in her ear
I might've been out of line
I might've pushed my luck
But before I had time to duck

She hauled off and kissed me
I didn't know what hit me
I was dazed and confused
She knocked me out of my shoes
She was strong for a girl that skinny
Her lips were like honey
I swear she pucker punched me
One minute she was dancing with me
And she just snapped
Hauled off and kissed me

We didn't take it outside
It was alright there
We were trippin' over tables and crashing through chairs
The bouncer came over and said: "Y'all quit!"
And I said: "Hey man! She started it"

She hauled off and kissed me
I didn't know what hit me
I was dazed and confused
She knocked me out of my shoes
She was strong for a girl that skinny
Her lips were like honey
I swear she pucker punched me
One minute she was dancing with me
And she just snapped
Hauled off and kissed me

She kept on coming and she wouldn't stop
It spilled on out into the parking lot
We went around another couple rounds
And finally she pined me down

Hauled off and kissed me
I didn't know what hit me
I was dazed and confused
She knocked me out of my shoes
She was strong for a girl that skinny
Her lips were like honey
But I swear she pucker punched me
One minute she was dancing with me
And she just snapped
Hauled off and kissed me

Hauled off and kissed me
She hauled off and kissed me

It's nearly 3 a.m
And still, no sight of him
When it comes to love
I'm in the dark
Lord, I don't understand
Why I stand by my man
All he's ever done
Is break my heart

Won't you send down an angel
From the blue to show me
The righteous thing to do
Oh, I'm calling out to you

Send down an angel
To ge me through
I'm not the praying kind but
It can't hurt to try

I can't find the answer by myself
I need help

Here I sit
Nobody with no one
And bein me
Ain't really all that fun
And leavin her wasn't very smart
Admitting I was wrong wouldn't be so hard

If it was cool to be a fool
I'd be the hippest guy around
If heartache made you famous
I'd be known from town to town
If tears were made of pennys and a cold beer brought her back
My bank account and self esteem would both be in the black
If some Hollywood producer made a movie that was sad
About some guy who lost
The best thing he ever had
Hey I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool

But we all know
The way it really is
You don't get recoginized
For doin things like this
You spend a lot of time
Feelin sorry for yourself
It doesn't really mean that much to anybody else

If it was cool to be a fool
I'd be the hippest guy around
If heartache made you famous
I'd be known from town to town
If tears were made of pennys and a cold beer brought her back
My bank account and self esteem would both be in the black
If some Hollywood producer made a movie that was sad
About some guy who lost
The best thing he ever had
Hey I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool

If it was cool to be a fool
I'd be the hippest guy around
If heartache made you famous
I'd be known from town to town
If tears were made of pennys and a cold beer brought her back
My bank account and self esteem would both be in the black
If some Hollywood producer made a movie that was sad
About some guy who lost
The best thing he ever had
Hey I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool

Hey I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool


Well I'll never forget the first time that I heard
That pretty mouth say that dirty word
And I can't even remember now what she backed my truck into
But she covered her mouth and her face got red
And she just looked so darn cute
That I couldn't even act like I was mad
Yeah I live for little moments like that


Well that's just like this last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector in the house was going off
And she was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah I live for little moments like that


I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank god that she isn't cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections it's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions and we're lost but holding hands
Yeah I live for little moments like that


When she's laying on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it cause it's tingling and it's numb
But she looks so much like an angel that I don't want to wake her up
Yeah I live for little moments
When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it
Yeah I live for little moments like that


You know Tommy going to trick his truck
Jack it up big time
Lift kit, chrome tip
Spit shining like a diamond
Game changed and the rain came
And we took it down a back road
Georgia clay mud hole, that is how these boys roll
Now it is late night underneath the moonlight
Everybody is feeling right, sipping on a bud light
Go on drop your tailgate, turn up your radio
I'ma build a bonfire, you can make yourself at home


Kick back, relax, you know we are just a bunch o hillbillies
Tip back a cup a Jack and throw your hands up with me


Hey, we might look a little crazy tonight
Hey baby, that is alright
It is our backwoods, boondocks roots; it is just what we do
It is just what we do
Hey, there is no way to make this up
When it is running through your blood
There is no hiding the truth
It is just what we do
It is just what we do
Yeah, it is just what we do


You see Tommy called Jenny
And Jenny going to call the hotties
To tell them about the party
So do not forget the Bacardi
Time to get your buzz on and your love on
All night long
And if you play your hand right
You would not have to go home alone
Six string picking, solo cup sipping
And when the moments right
Grab your phone and get them digits
Cranking that Bocephus, we all good with Jesus
Come Sunday morning that preacher, he about to preach it
Kick back, relax and pass the good time moonshine
Who brought the party? Damn, that was Florida Georgia Line


Hey, we might look a little crazy tonight
Hey baby, that is alright
It is our backwoods, boondocks roots; it is just what we do
It is just what we do
Hey, there is no way to make this up
When it is running through your blood
There is no hiding the truth
It is just what we do
It is just what we do
Yeah, it is just what we do

Well he was sitting by me, at the beach front bar
He seem pretty tore up so I bought him a beer and we lit up a couple Cuban cigars
Well a couple beers in we was gettin' profound
He said "A guy like me likes the simple things that I...I can wrap my head around"
I didn't know where he was going but I began to understand
When he stood up on his stool like a fool and started holerin' at the band:

"So play me something about drinkin', one about cheatin', a few about losin', lyin' and a-leavin'
Something where somebody did somebody wrong, and play it all night long
But dont play me no lo oh oh ove song
Dont play me no love song."

He said "Wait a minute man, I know who you are
Ain't...ain't you that fella on the tv in a cowboy hat always playing guitar"
I said "Yeah that's me"
I thought "Boy, there goes that"
He didn't want a cd or a picture of me autographed, no all he asked was

Just play me something about drinkin', one about cheatin', a few about losin', lyin' and a-leavin'
Something where somebody did somebody wrong, and play it all night long
But dont play me no lo oh oh ove song
Dont play me no love song

No gonna last forever, smilin', dancin', laughin'
Hey let me hear about how it really happened

Play me something about drinkin', one about cheatin', a few about losin', lyin' and a-leavin'
Something where somebody did somebody wrong

Play me something about drinkin', one about cheatin', a few about losin', lyin' and a-leavin'
Something where somebody did somebody wrong, Oh she done me wrong
But dont play me no lo oh oh ove song

Well you know those times
When you feel like there's a sign there on your back
Say's I don't mind if ya kick me
Seems like everybody has
Things go from bad to worse
You'd think they can't get worse than that
And then they do

You still walk the straight and narrow
And you don't know where you are
Use the needle of your compass
To sew up your broken heart
Ask directions from a genie
In a bottle of Jim Beam
And she lies to You
That's when you learn the truth

If you're going through hell
Keep on going, Don't slow down
If you're scared, don't show it
You might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there

Well I been deep down in that darkness
I been down to my last match
Felt a hundered different demons
Breathing fire down my back
And I knew that if I stumbled
I'd fall right into the trap that they were laying, Yeah

But the good news
Is there's angels everywhere out on the street
Holding out a hand to pull you back upon your feet
The one's that you been dragging for so long
You're on your knees
You might as well be prayin'
Guess what I'm saying
If you're going through hell
Keep on going, Don't slow down
If you're scared, don't show it
You might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there

Yeah, If you're going through hell
Keep on moving, Face that fire
Walk right through it
You might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there

If you're going through hell
Keep on going, Don't slow down
If you're scared, don't show it
You might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there

Yeah, If you're going through hell
Keep on moving, Face that fire
Walk right through it
You might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there
Yeah you might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there
Yeah


Old Mr. Jackson cuts his grass after church on his tractor
Only after listening to the country countdown
He remembers all the three cord sessions
Giving lessons, never guessing
We'd go from dive bars to sold out
He just smiles, can’t help but grin when he turns that dial on the FM
Here’s an old friend, he can’t believe it
Ain’t that what it’s all about?
What it’s all about, yeah


All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make 'em turn it up loud
Roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give 'em that sound
Everybody’s talking about
We still the same old, same old southern boys
Still got the same old, same old southern voice
We’re singing now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud


All the whining through the years
All the grinding of the gears
All the passion and the tears
Man, it paid off
All the places that we see
All the people that we meet
It still feels like a dream
That we’re living on
It ain’t the lights and fame
It ain’t the smoking flame
It’s that sweet hearted smile on my mama’s face


All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make 'em turn it up loud
Roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give 'em that sound
Everybody’s talking about
We still the same old, same old southern boys
Still got the same old, same old southern voice
We’re singing now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud




In every song
Every way
In every move I'd ever made
That’s right, north west Georgia, where you all at?
In every song
Every way
In every move I’ve ever made
Chattanooga, Tennessee, turn it up
Come on


All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make 'em turn it up loud
Roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give 'em that sound
Everybody’s talking about
We still the same old, same old southern boys
Still got the same old, same old southern voice
We’re singing now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud


Old Mr. Jackson cuts his grass after church on his tractor
Only after listening to the country countdown


Mom got drunk and dad got drunk
At our Christmas party
We were drinkin' champagne punch
And homemade eggnog
Little sister brought her new boyfriend
He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him
'Til he sang Feliz Navidad
Feliz Navidad


Brother Ken brought his kids with him
The three from his first wife Lynn
And the two identical twins
From his second wife Mary Nell
Of course he brought his new wife Kay
Who talks all about AA
Chain smokin' while the stereo plays
Noel, Noel, The first Noel


Carve the turkey turn the ballgame on
Mix Margaritas when the eggnog's gone
Send somebody to the Quik-Pak store
We need some ice and an extension cord
A can of bean dip and some Diet Rite
A box of Pampers, some Marlboro Lights
Hallelujah everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the family


Fran and Rita drove from Harlingen
I can't remember how I'm kin to them
But when they tried to plug their motor home in
They blew our Christmas lights
Cousin David knew just what went wrong
So we all waited out on our front lawn
He threw the breaker and the lights came on
And we sang Silent Night
Silent Night o' holy night


Carve the turkey turn the ballgame on
Mix Bloody Marys 'cause we all want one
Send somebody to the Stop 'n Go
We need some celery and a can of fake snow
A bag of lemons and some Diet Sprite
A box of Midol, some Salem Lights
Hallelujah everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the family
Feliz Navidad


She dropped the phone and burst into tears
The doctor just confirmed her fears
Her husband held it in and held her tight
Cancer don’t discriminate or care if you’re just 38
With three kids who need you in their lives
He said, "I know that you’re afraid and I am, too
But you’ll never be alone, I promise you"


When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it


She made it through the surgery fine
They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again
She said, "I don't think I can do this anymore"
He took her in his arms and said "That's what my love is for"


When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it
Oh baby
Yeah

And when this road gets too long
I'll be the rock you lean on
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it
I'm going to love you through it
I'm going to love you through it


Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo-hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggling close together
Like two birds of a feather should be
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
There's a birthday party
At the house of farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending
To the perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing
Without a single stop
At the fireplace where
We'll watch the chestnuts pop
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives

Things get in the way, rush of every day
Ordinary stuff we all get into
Wouldn't it be sad, if all you ever had
Was a granite epitaph that said I meant to?

So any pretty woman I didn't take the time to kiss
Any crazy thing I didn't do, I meant to
Any dirty liar I didn't stare right in the eye
And make 'em tell the naked truth, I meant to

I'm always on the run, things get lost
Some things get done
But if I didn't have all the fun, I meant to
I meant to

If I never came out and said
To each and every woman I love
How much I really do
I meant to

Maybe this one chance is all we really have
Maybe all you got is what you get to
Well I ain't gonna cry, I'll give it my best try
And kiss the world goodbye and say I meant to

So any pretty woman I didn't take the time to kiss
Any crazy thing I didn't do, I meant to
Any dirty liar I didn't stare right in the eye
And make 'em tell the naked truth, I meant to

I'm always on the run, things get lost
Some things get done
But if I didn't have all the fun, I meant to
I meant to

And if I never came out and said
To each and every woman I love
How much I really do
I meant to

I meant to
I meant to


Grandma had a garden in her backyard
She always had a way with things that grow
She'd be out there early in the springtime
Just as soon as she was sure it wouldn't snow
She said, "I love to watch the seeds I've planted
Grow up into what they ought to be."
I thought she was talking 'bout tomatoes
But she was talking about her family


Grandma's garden, it grew up strong
'Cause she weeded out whatever could go wrong
She'd say, "The straight and narrow is toughest row to hoe."
Just remember what you reap is what you sow
Grandma's love is what made Grandma's garden grow


I went to church last Sunday morning
The same one she attended sixty years
They asked me I could say some words about her
And I got up fighting back tears
And I said, I used to watch her rake the rocks out
And tie up every vine with love and care
That little piece of ground taught me some lessons
And without her I wouldn't have a prayer


Grandma's garden, it grew up strong
'Cause she weeded out whatever could go wrong
She'd say, "The straight and narrow is toughest row to hoe."
Just remember what you reap is what you sow
Grandma's love is what made Grandma's garden grow


Some day when I have children of my own
AI'm watching them play
Someday when they grow up, I want to hear them say


Grandma's garden, it grew up strong
'Cause she weeded out whatever could go wrong
She'd say, The straight and narrow is toughest row to hoe."
In the garden of the Father, now she's home
Grandma's love is what made Grandma's garden grow


You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were
We wouldn't be in this place tonight
Lost and lonely, scared and confused
We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight
Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues
We both got scars from the hell we been threw
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose


So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide


Reconnected, feeling no pain
Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)
Worn and weathered, scared to go home
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused
The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now
Most people don't, but some people do



Sunshine shining in the summertime breeze
The whole world's smiling, if you know what I mean
Cool, cool time, hangin' out with the boys
An AM radio making some noise
Tunin' in to a moment in time
When everything seemed like the perfect rhyme
Here it is. Here I go. My show. Can't wait
Gotta do it now 'fore it gets too late

Hey, man, look at me now
Nothing in the world's gonna get me down
Sparks fly, I'm on fire:
Way up high, and I'm getting higher
Turn it loose; turning it on
On a day like this
What could go wrong?
Tip my hat, blow a kiss to the crowd
(Hey, man, look at me now.)

Green grass growing on the edge of my feet
Feels good knowing I'm not out of my league
Singing a song that I never have sung;
Out of my reach on the tip of my tongue
Who knows if tomorrow will come
It really don't matter 'til this day's done
Gotta move. Gotta go. My fate. My turn
Still a little daylight left to burn
(Still a little daylight left to burn.)

Hey, man, look at me now
Nothing in the world's gonna get me down
Sparks fly, I'm on fire:
Way up high, and I'm getting higher
Turn it loose; turning it on
On a day like this
What could go wrong?
Tip my hat, blow a kiss to the crowd
(Hey, man, look at me now.)

Sunshine shining in the summertime breeze
The whole world's smiling, if you know what I mean
Here it is. Here I go. My show. Can't wait
Gotta do it now 'fore it gets too late
(Gotta do it now 'fore it gets too late.)

Hey, man, look at me now
Nothing in the world's gonna get me down
Sparks fly, I'm on fire:
Way up high, and I'm getting higher
Turn it loose; turning it on
On a day like this
What could go wrong?
Tip my hat, blow a kiss to the crowd
(Hey, man, look at me now.)

Hey, man, look at me now. (Now.)
Look at me now. (Now.)
Look at me now. (Now.)
Look at me now. (Now.)

(Hey, man, look at me now.)


He was sitting at the bar, sipping on a regular Coke
We were drinking and smoking and making him the butt of our jokes
We all said, "Man, what happened to you? Why can't you just have a few?"
He said, "I would if I could, but it's probably best that I don't"


Because the more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancing machine
I get loud, I get proud and it gets worse
Well if I have one, I'll have thirteen
Now, there aren’t no in-between
'Cause, the more I drink, the more I drink


A couple of cold ones, and somebody hands me a shot
Hell, even buck-tooth and bow-legged women start looking hot
And pretty soon I'm bumming cigarettes and sweet talking some big brunette
Yeah, once I get on a roll, there aren’t no telling where I'll stop


'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancing machine
I get loud, I get proud and it gets worse
Well if I have one, I'll have thirteen
Now, there aren’t no in-between
Cause, the more I drink, the more I drink


Yep-yep
Hum, that's what I'm talking about


Man, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
And they can't get me off the karaoke machine
The more I drink the more I drink
Yeah, the more I drink, the more I drink, the more I drink

Thomas Jefferson he had slaves
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
I read about him in the seventh grade
He's forgiven

JFK he loved to run around
He and Norma Jean painted that town
But we know him as a hero now
He's forgiven

(Chorus)
Baby I know I did you wrong
That's why I'm here that's why your gone
I don't know just what I've done
To be one of the unforgiven

I had an uncle he dodged the draft
They said step forward and he stepped back
But we all cut him some slack
He's forgiven

Judas betrayed the christ with a kiss
Cartel kings get a slap on the wrist
Jesse James and Billy the kid
They're all forgiven

(Repeat Chorus)
I've made mistakes, That's what life is
But there ain't a thing I can't live with
And even though you can't forgive
You're forgiven. (END)


It's strange to hear your voice
I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doing
How I'm holding up
Since you did me wrong


Well how am I doing since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doing since you did what you done to me


Well now wait one minute, I
Failed to mention
Those tears I cried, are tears of joy
Cause' it was no fun there
Under your thumb and
Now that we're done I'm
Getting right every night
With every single ever-loving girl in sight, so




Well when all my friends heard what a
You know what you were they
Took me out on the town
But then I heard our song and
I dance along but
It felt all wrong cause
She was sweet, she let me lead
She never took her ever-loving eyes off me so




Well I don't know what you were thinking
Running round on me
Now you say you're sorry
Well honey I agree...so


How are you doing since you did
What you done to me
Girl don't lie you know you cry
Cause' you know how good it used to be
Yeah, tell me does the thought of
Losing my true love make it hard to sleep, baby
How are you doing since you did
What you done to me


Yeah how are you doing, now that you know
How I'm doing since you did
What you done to me

If I live to be a hundred
And never see the seven wonders
That'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a Grammy
I'm gonna be just fine
Cause I know exactly who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

So when I make a big mistake
And when I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be alright
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowing
I will be just fine
Cause nothing changes who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

I'm a saint
And I'm a sinner
I'm a loser
I'm a winner
I am steady and unstable
I'm young
But I am able

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

She's black smoke forming across the sky
I ask for water and she brings me wine, she brings me wine
She's one part angel, the other part sin
I say I'm tired and she says, let's go again
Let's go again


My kind of, my kind of beautiful
Lover and friend
If I'm dreaming, please don't wake me up
I wanna see how, how the story ends

She's a bad moon risin'
She's the sunlight through the rain
She's the calm before the storm
Yeah she's a hurricane
A hurricane

Sunday morning service, and her dress is so tight
I never heard the preacher's words but I saw the light
I saw the light


I wanna see how it ends

If I'm dreaming, please don't wake me up
I wanna see how, how the story ends



My kind of, my kind of beautiful
Lover and friend

My kind of beautiful

She's such a beautiful handful
Might be more than I can handle
She's a wild child running down a Friday night
Got me wrapped around her finger and holding on tight

She's so hot, hey, what's not to love
Heaven's little devil's got me all messed up
She's a little heart breaker, and I'm her fool
She's so hot, it's hard to be cool
Hard to be cool

She's like a ten, but better
She leads me on, but I let her
Might be a spring fling heartache headed my way
And I may be crazy, but all I can say is

She's so hot, hey, what's not to love
Heaven's little devil's got me all messed up
She's a little heart breaker, and I'm her fool
She's so hot, it's hard to be cool
Hard to be cool

And I ain't never seen anything like her
In that sexy little sundress, man, she's on fire

She's so hot
Mmm, yeah, she's hot, son

She's so hot, hey, what's not to love
Heaven's little devil's got me all messed up
She's a little heart breaker, and I'm her fool
She's so hot, it's hard to be cool
Yeah, it's hard to be cool

Yeah, it's hard to be cool
She's so hot

I was on a bus coming back to us
From Atlanta in '53
And I picked up a Rhythm & Blues magazine
Laying underneath my seat
And I found out the stuff they'd been playing us
Wasn't made from grits and bone
And it would take more than the Crew Cuts
And Pat Boone to take me home


I want the real thing
Give me the real thing
Make it loud I'll make you proud
Or the songs they'd sing
I don't want you under my roof with your 86 proof
Watered down ''til it tastes like tea
You're gonna pull my string
Make it the real thing


I remember old Elvis when he forgot
To remember to forget
And when young Johnny Cash hadn't seen this side of
Big River yet
And old Luther and Lewis and Perkins was picking
And playing them songs for me




Baby, don’t say no so quick
This ain’t about me tryin’ to see how far that I can get
But I ain’t gonna lie, I wouldn’t mind
Just a little bit of you and I
Eye to eye, lips on lips, swayin’ to the music
Real close, we could we both use a little
A let go kinda night
Baby, if you want a


Good time we can get on it
Take a shot or you can sip on it
Find a floor and we can dance on it, slow song it
Far as I can tell that finger ain’t got no ring on it
Come on baby, bring on it
It’s one of those stars fallin’, love callin’
Get ya feelin’ all right nights

Every little thing you got, you know that I want it, want it
Sounds pretty dang good now don’t it


Well, I just now seen that smile
And I bet it’s been a minute since you tapped on into
Your wild and crazy side
So baby, let’s do this
Tonight, baby that moon looks
Just right, don’t fight it, if you want a


Good time we can get on it

Lucinda Jones workin' at the IHOP
Ten years worth of bacon, eggs an' tears
She's waited on every creed an' color
While waitin' on this day to get here
Graveyard shifts, two big tips
Makin' every quarter count
Was worth it all to see her son
In that cap an' gown

There are times in life when you gotta crawl
Lose your grip, trip an' fall
When you can't lean on no-one else:
That's when you find yourself
I've been around an' I've noticed that
Walkin's easier when the road is flat
Them danged ol' heels'll get you every time
Yeah, the good Lord gave us mountains
So we could learn how to climb

Bobby, Bobby Dunn came back from the war
Lost his leg but they couldn't take his will
Hell bent to run in that local marathon
He trained through the endless pain an' pills
It hurt so bad that sometimes
He just had to cry
He didn't stop until he crossed
That finish line

There are times in life when you gotta crawl
Lose your grip, trip an' fall
When you can't lean on no-one else:
That's when you find yourself
I've been around an' I've noticed that
Walkin's easier when the road is flat
Them danged ol' heels'll get you every time
Yeah, the good Lord gave us mountains
So we could learn how to climb

This world ain't fair
It can knock you on your butt
You can just lie there
Or you can get back up
You gotta get back up

There are times in life when you gotta crawl
Lose your grip, trip an' fall
When you can't lean on no-one else:
That's when you find yourself
I've been around an' I've noticed that
Walkin's easier when the road is flat
Them danged ol' heels'll get you every time
Yeah, the good Lord gave us mountains
(The good Lord gave us mountains)
So we could learn how to climb
Yeah, oh

Baby, can't you feel that?
Baby, don't you hear that?
That's the sound of freedom
Calling our names
It's turning us as always
All you got to do is turn the key
Let this feeling carry us away

Baby, let's ride
Chase a little sunset
Watch that moon on the rise
Baby, let's ride
Miles of road where there ain't no wind in sight
Let the wheels of this RAM truck
Kick up a little dust while you're holding on tight

Come on
Baby, let's ride

Girl, you know the night is young
There's no reason not to run
A few miles of memories down this road
Baby, we don't need a map
Pick a star and we'll follow that
What are we waiting on?  Girl, let's go

Baby, let's ride
Chase a little sunset
Watch that moon on the rise
Baby, let's ride
Miles of road where there ain't no wind in sight
Let the wheels of this RAM truck
Kick up a little dust while you're holding on tight

Come on
Baby let's ride
Is how you got me feelin' right now
Baby, let's ride
Don't look back and never come down

Let the wheels of this RAM truck
Kick up a little dust while you're holding on tight
Come on
Baby let's ride


You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring


You finally took my hand
You finally took my hand
It took a nip of gin
But you finally took my hand


You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring


Mama don't approve
Mama don't approve
Daddy says he's the best in town
And mama don't approve


You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring


Baby's on its way
Baby's on its way
Say I do and kiss me quick
Because baby's on its way
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring

Undeniable, so incredible
Simply wonderful, you're beautiful

Everything I am, and I wanna be
You see in me

I wanna touch your skin
Til in feels like a sin
And take you places
That you've never been

Oh Baby this is real
The way you make me feel, unbelievable

Got your breath on my skin and the taste of your kiss
Every inch and every curve
Late at night can't believe when you lie next to me
Cause I know this is more than I deserve

Got your breath on my skin and the taste of your kiss
Every inch and every curve
Late at night I can't believe when you lie next to me
Cause I know this is more than I deserve

Undeniable, so incredible
Simply wonderful, you're beautiful


I've been humbled by the Glory
And the power of his love
When I've stumbled and I've fallen
He's been there to pick me up

In the face of all temptation
Been the strength to stand my ground
Wrapped in His sweet salvation
I know I'm Glory-bound


I'm a man
I'm not an angel
Oh, I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time


I've cried tears of jealous sorrow
I have tasted bitter wine
Lost faith in my tomorrow
And I've cursed the hands of time

I wandered through the darkness
Surrendered to my doubts
I've been so close to Hell
I've could hear the devil shout


I'm a man
I'm not an angel
Oh, I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time
Oh, yeah


When all the clouds have parted
And I lie face to face with death
I won't fear the darkness
In the grasp of my last breath

I climb that mighty stairway
That leads to Heaven's gate
The surrender of my soul
Will be my final leap of faith


I'm a man
I'm not an angel
Oh, I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time

Oh, I'm a man
I'm not an angel
Oh, I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time

One step at a time
I said
One step at a time


Hey baby, I guess you're wondering
What I'm doing home so soon; no I ain't sick
It's just this morning when you told me
You didn't feel like you were the most important thing in my life


And you know what
That well broke my heart
So I had to turn around and come back
And tell you what I'm gonna do about it


I'm gonna light the bedroom candles
Take the phone out of the wall
We'll lay around and talk for hours
Or maybe we won't talk at all
I'm gonna resurrect the love
That slipped away from us
And the man you've been missing
Starting with some long, slow kisses


I just wanna let you know how ashamed I am
For making you feel that way darling, I'm so sorry
I guess I've just been spending too much time on making a living
And way too little on making love


But if you can find it in your heart
To forgive me girl
I swear from this moment on
You'll always know where you stand with me


I'm gonna light the bedroom candles
Take the phone out of the wall
We'll lay around and talk for hours
Or maybe we won't talk at all
I'm gonna resurrect the love
That slipped away from us
And the man you've been missing
Starting with some long, slow kisses


'Cause what really matters most
Is you and me this close
Feeling no distance
Sharing some long, slow kisses
Sharing some long, slow kisses


Under a lovers' sky
Gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around
If you think that you won't fall
Well, just wait until
Til the sun goes down


Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling, so right
It will steal your heart tonight


You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart


There's no escaping love
Once a gentle breeze
Weaves it's spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It won't be too long (not too long)
'Til you're in my arms


Underneath the starlight, starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm, so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight


You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you can't
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
No, matter what you do (no matter what you do)
The night is gonna get to you


(Never know
Cannot know)
Don't try, you're never gonna win


Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling, so right
It will steal your heart tonight


You can try
(You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss but you know)
But you know that you (you know that you)
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark (deep in the dark)
You'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight, no, you can't fight it
(You can try) You can try to resist my kiss
But you know, don't you know that you can't?
Can't fight the moonlight deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart (surrender your heart)
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart

Check, check, one, where is all my violins?

My checks ain't bouncin', but they sure is shakin'
I ain't broke yet, but I sure am breakin'
My BLT's just waitin' on my bacon
For heavens' sake, good, good gracious

There's too much month at the end of the money
Not enough dough at the end of the day
Don't know why I'm laughin' 'cause it sure ain't funny
There's too much month at the end of the money

I swimmin' in the red, drownin' in the blues
I ain't rollin' in the green, like I likes to
My piggy bank is empty, no chicks in the coop
I need a cash cow, a little moo la moo

There's too much month at the end of the money
Not enough dough at the end of the day
Don't know why I'm laughin' 'cause it sure ain't funny
There's too much month at the end of the money

Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right
Oh, I've done some thinkin'
And I'd be okay if a month was only 24 days

There's too much month at the end of the money
Not enough dough at the end of the day
My bottom line is just down right funky
There's too much month at the end of the money

There's too much month at the end of the money
I don't know why I'm laughin' 'cause it sure ain't funny
There's too much month at the end of the money

Oh, at the end of the money
Moo la moo

Toss a little bone to the working man

Dear uncle sam you got a lot to do
But I just want to have a little talk with you
You probably don't remember even who I am
But I build your cars and I till your land
While you're busy giving out all that cash
While you're politicians talk all that trash
While you're busy cleaning up your own mess
Maybe you could honor my small request

Chorus:
Take off the tax on a cold six pack
Add another day to make the weekend last
So dear uncle sam somebody needs a hand
So toss a little bone to the working man
Toss a little bone to the working man

Make it a law that we all get a raise
And prices go a little lower every day
Where men can't judge a man by his car
And if you keep your nose clean then you will go far
I build your bridges and I carry your loads
Driving those big rigs over your roads
Hate to spend my money like I got it to burn
Seems like I ought to get a little return

Chorus (Repeat 2X)

Toss a little bone to the working man (Repeat 3X)


Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
And that don't sound like you
No, that don't sound like you
I know it's been a while, I don't mean to pry
But when I asked you if you're happy I didn't hear a smile
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like


Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
Because you don't sound like you any more


Your pretty brown hair, you always loved it
Guess he didn't like it so you just cut it
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like


Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause baby, you don't sound like you any more
Oh, anymore


That town, that job, that guy
You can leave them behind, girl, you know you're better than that
If you want to come back, you can come back
Baby, come back to


Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
Because you don't sound like you any more


Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl


You order a drink, it goes down smooth
Before you can blink, it turns into two
It was just gonna be another night with the boys
Shooting some pool, pickin' a stool and making some noise
Then she walks in and I never dance
Turns into tippin' the band, and taking her hand… ah man


It happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that
Nothing to lose turns right into you
Doing all you can do just to keep her around
Till the moon goes down and you're back at your house
One thing leads to another, you're loving each other
One look and you never look back
It happens like that
It happens like that


I guess that's what you get
It's true what they say
As soon as you stop looking, it's right in front of your face
Cause there you were and there I was and here we are, I tell you what


True love, it happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that
Nothing to lose turns right into you
Doing all you can do just to keep her around
Till the moon goes down and you're back at your house
One thing leads to another, you're loving each other
One look and you never look back
It happens like that, yeah




Ever wonder how
Just one drink
Turns into one knee down with a diamond ring


It happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that
Nothing to lose turns right into you
Doing all you can do just to keep her around
Till the moon goes down and you're back at your house
One thing leads to another, you're loving each other
One look and you never look back
It happens like that


You order a drink, it goes down smooth
Before you can blink, it turns into two


Don't ya hate hearing that clock on the wall chiming
Saying it's time
And don't you just wish we could just stay right here together
All day long
You know it wouldn't be a crime
If we crawl back into bed
Got as close as we could get
Trying to figure out where this thing is going


Baby, Baby don't
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you just stay a little bit longer
Got it going on
And I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger


If ya got to go
You got to know
I might go crazy
Here without you baby
We're living every kiss
You ain't leaving me like this
It just ain't right
Wait until tonight
To lite another flame
You know it wouldn't be the same as the fire we got burning this morning


Baby, Baby don't
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you just stay a little bit longer
Got it going on
And I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger


Love, no one else can love me like you do
You know, I ain't even close to through- loving you


Baby, Baby don't
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you just stay a little bit longer
Got it going on
And I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger


Don't
Baby, Baby don't
No baby don't
(Baby, baby, oh, baby, baby don't)
Oh no, no, baby don't
(Baby, baby, oh, baby, baby don't)
You, Don't
Baby, Baby, Don't


May we all get to grow up in our red white and blue little town
Get a won't start hand me down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
Cause you miss it too much


May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all


May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes


May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all


May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one


Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all (get to have a chance to ride the fast one)
May we all (walk away wiser when we crashed one)
May we all (keep hoping that the best one is the last one)
(yeah the last one)
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walked to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down a red dirt road

I went out into the world, and I came back in
I lost Mary, oh I got her back again
And driving home tonight feels like I've found a long lost friend

(Darryl Worley/Bobby Tomberlin)

I'm tired of working every day for a dollar
About to choke on my own blue collar
This ain't gonna last
Misled by the grand illusion
I've come to this conclusion
I can't make a move too fast
It was written in the sky today
By the morning sun it sure looks like a good day to run

Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run

My baby's been working as a cashier

She didn't get a vacation this past year
Now it won't be long
We don't need no destination
Just a tank of gas and a good clear station
Playing our favorite song
There're some places that we ain't been
Some things we ain't done
And it sure looks like a good day to run

Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run

I don't know why I left (I don't know why I left)
But I know it won't be long (But I know it won't be long)
No it won't be long (No it won't be long)
Till I get back home

They gave me a green uniform and black boots for my feel
Eighteen and wild as hell, I thought it would be neat
They put me on a plane to some strange and foreign land
I said my good-bye to mom and dad and hello to Uncle Sam

Once I was a soldier and not afraid to die
Now I'm a little older and not afraid to cry
Everyday I'm thankful just to be alive
When you've been where I've been any kind of life
Is paradise

Christmas of eighty-nine was a lonely time for me
Panama was probably fine but it was nothing like Tennessee
I never thought the day would come when I might have to kill a man
I did not sleep a wink that night but we won for Uncle Sam

Once I was a soldier and not afraid to die
Now I'm a little older and not afraid to cry
Everyday I'm thankful just to be alive
When you've been where I've been any kind of life
Is paradise

If you've been where I've been any kind of life
Is paradise

It's paradise
Paradise

The First Noel the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind hath bought
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King
Born is the King
Born is the King of Israel!

There's a girl out on the back porch
Trying to say good night
Mama's there in the kitchen
Flicking on and off the lights
That boy's gotta go now
It's getting pretty late
She says, "Mama, I don't wanna disobey."


But I need 5 more minutes
Cause I ain't ready yet
We're out here counting the stars
This night's as pretty as it gets
Please mama, don't make him go
Cause I need 5 more minutes
5 more minutes

Now there's a daddy that tells the organist
To play one more song
No, nothing's wrong
I just want another moment to hold my baby girl
Since the first day I held you
I knew this day would come
Oh, honey
I'm so glad you found the one


But I need 5 more minutes
Cause I ain't ready yet
With that white dress and flowers in your hair
You're as pretty as it gets
But it's so hard to let my baby go
I need 5 more minutes
5 more minutes, yeah

Now it's just him and her and God
Around that bed
And he needs 5 more minutes
Cause he ain't ready yet
Oh, his wrinkled hands are praying
Wishing God'd take him instead
And he can't let her go

Cause he needs 5 more minutes
5 more minutes, yeah
Man that clock ticks so fast
Cause once time passes
You can't have it back

I need a car when I'm driving
A plane when I'm flying
A call takes a quarter and dime
I need a radio playing
When there's nothing worth saying
And help when I'm falling behind
Extra rest on occasion Holiday or vacation
But I need you all the time

Every beat of my heart
Every thought in my head
Points straight to you
Underlined in red
Every move I make
Every minute of mine
I need you all the time

I need boots when I'm walking
Southern drawl when I'm talking
And run when I want to unwind
A little cash when I'm going
Some freedom for growing
Some preaching to keep me in line
They can build it or dream it
I could take it or leave it
But I need you all the time

Every beat of my heart
Every thought in my head
Points straight to you
Underlined in red
Every move I make
Every minute of mine
I need you all the time

--- Instrumental ---

Every beat of my heart
Every thought in my head
Points straight to you
Underlined in red
Every move I make
Every minute of mine
I need you all the time

I need a car when I'm driving
A plane when I'm flying
A map when there's a city to find
I need you all the time
Yeah, I need you all the time
I need you all the time...


Something about a truck in a farmer's field
A no trespass sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal
Something about a truck in a farmer's field

Something about beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
Something about beer sitting on ice

Something about a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field, will make a boy a mess
Something about a girl in a red sundress

Something about a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing, you've ever felt before
Something about a kiss that's gonna lead to more


And there's something about a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's something about you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's something about a truck


Something about a creek around 2 am
After a few of those beers you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, just hang 'em on a limb
Something about a creek around 2 am


And there's something about a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's something about you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's something about a truck


This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be


Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this


I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never had to even leave this room


Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this
Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)


I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time


Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone


You're as smooth... as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned, on your love all the time


I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high


And you're as smooth... as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned, on your love all the time




You're as smooth... as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned, on your love all the time


You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey

Well, the sun sets in the west
But as fast as you go how would you know
You're a busy boy, I guess
Who just wants the gold at the end of the road

Think of all you miss
Passin' through like this

You want an answer as soon as you say a prayer
You want to land the moment you're in the air
Baby, the livin' is all in the gettin' there

Don't be the first in every line
Now and then you can be at the end
'Cause there's only so much time
And you can't get back every minute you spend
You're not even sure what you're runnin' for

You want an answer as soon as you say a prayer
You want to land the moment you're in the air
Baby, the livin' is all in the gettin' there

Think of all you miss
Passin' through like this

You want an answer as soon as you say a prayer
You want to land the moment you're in the air
Baby, the livin' is all in the gettin' there

The livin' is all in the gettin' there

Gettin' there...


Everybody said we wouldn’t make it baby
Love don’t live around here much lately
Times are hard and hearts break like the bank
Aw yes they do
Lots of reasons just to give it on up
Leave your soul on the shelf collecting dust
Live in a world of broken promises and empty tanks
Aw but look at us


Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?


Put on a little old Keith Whitley
Back porch dancin’ singin’ with me
I’m no stranger to the rain, no, no we ain’t
Pour a little bit of homemade wine
Make some love, take our sweet time
Why the hell do we complain


Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?


Look at us we got a life out here
Outlaws, in-laws, coolers of beer
Spot on the wall to hang last year’s deer
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Red, white and blue flag hangin’
Kids in the back just a tire swingin’
Fireworks booming and banging
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?


Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?
Oh, oh, yeah


They say we’d never make it baby
Love don’t live around here much lately
What do you think about that?


I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me is on their honeymoon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart-shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me


Well I don't know how I landed on this movie set
It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never would have noticed if we'd never met
But everybody's got somebody but me


And I miss you
Without you I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again


I hear love songs playing on the radio
People slow dancing everywhere I go
Well, I'm a good slow dancer, but you'd never know
'Cause everybody's got somebody but me
Yeah they do
Everybody's got somebody but me


And I miss you
Without you, I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again


Sitting here lonely at a table for two
Watching lovers being lovers in the corner booth
Seems like even cupid don't know what to do
Everybody's got somebody but me


Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever find another you
But everybody's got somebody but me
Everybody, got somebody
Oh everybody, everybody, everybody but me now


(Everybody's got somebody)
Everybody has got somebody
(Everybody but me)
Everybody but me
(Everybody's got somebody)
Everybody
I miss you
(Everybody but me)
Everybody's got somebody but me


In the mornin' on a Saturday, I got my girls and we're skippin' town
In my '67 442 got the rag top down
Aldean's on the radio, ain't it funny how they sing along
Makes you smile just a little bit because it's not a Miley Cyrus song


These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there


Loadin' up and livin' right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and the fishin' poles
What a way to save my soul
This endless summer


Now we're at our little getaway, Zoe go and grab the fishin' poles
I can't think of any other better way for us to cleanse our souls
Fresh trapper on the wheel tonight, cherrystones straight out the shell
Just another day in paradise, another story I can tell


These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there


Loadin' up and livin' right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and the fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
This endless summer


Monday mornin' and it's gettin' late
There's no traffic at the tollbooth line
Aldean's on the radio
And my three girls know every line


And these are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there


Loadin' up and livin' right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the music's right
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
This endless summer night


I finally asked you to dance
On the last slow song
Beneath that moon that was really a disco ball
I can still feel my head on your shoulder
And hoping that song would never be over


I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful and dancin' away with my heart


I brushed your curls back so I could see your eyes
And the way you moved me was like you were reading my mind
I can still feel you lean in to kiss me
I can't help but wonder if you ever miss me


I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful and dancin' away with my heart


You headed off to college
At the end of that summer and we lost touch
I guess I didn't realize even at that moment we lost so much


I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful and dancin' away with my heart


Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Away with my Heart
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah

(Kim Richy/Chuck Prophet)

One more time
Yeah,that's what I said back a couple of times ago
Thank you
Kindly for reminding me I'm good to go

I'm gone
And I'm taking all my good stuff
Gone,gone
You'll never get it back
I'm gone,gone
Been a long time coming
Bet you're gonna miss me bad

That's right
This party isn't all that it's cracked up to be
Yeah,boy
You gotta grab yourself a partner but don't look at me

I'm gone
And I'm taking all my good stuff
Gone,gone
You'll never get it back
I'm gone,gone
Been a long time coming
Bet you're gonna miss me bad

Hey you
Yeah,you there with that smug look smeared across your face
That's right
I've got better things to do then hang around this place

I'm gone
And I'm taking all my good stuff
Gone,gone
You'll never get it back
I'm gone,gone
Been a long time coming
Bet you're gonna miss me bad

I'm gone
And I'm taking all my good stuff
Gone,gone
You'll never get it back
I'm gone,gone
Been a long time coming
Bet you're gonna miss me bad

I always said that'd be it
That I wouldn't stick around
If it ever came to this
And here I am
So confused
How am I supposed to leave?
When I can't even move

In the time it would have took to say
Honey I'm home how was your day?
You dropped a bomb right where we live
And just expect me to forgive

Well that's a mighty big word for such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
Cause I don't even know now who I am
It's too soon for me to say forgive..

I should ask but I won't
Was it love or just her touch
Cause I don't think I wanna know
So get you some things
And get out (get out, get out)
Don't call me for a day or two
So I can sort this out

Well you might as well've ripped the life
Right out of me
Right here tonight
And through the fallin tears you said
Can you ever just forgive?

Well, thats a mighty big word for such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
Cause I don't even know now who I am
It's too soon for me to say forgive..


They say life is so much sweeter
Through the telephoto lens of fame
Around here you get just as much attention
Cheering at the high school football game
I dreamed of going to Nashville
Put my money down and place my bet
But I just got the first buck of the season
I made the front page of the "Turner Town Gazette"


Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows you just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town


Tyler and Casey broke up
It ended pretty quietly
We heard he was caught red-handed with her mama
So that's just what they let us all believe


Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows you just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town


Baby who
Needs their faces in a magazine
Me and you
We've been stars of the town since we were 17


Let's go on down to the quick stop
Wear your yellow shades
And I'll put on my tight jeans
And we'll just spend the weekend burnin' rubber
And we'll let 'em point and stare in disbelief


'Cause every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows you just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town
Everybody dies famous in a small town


Another long summer's come and gone
I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight


But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander 'round this town
'til summer comes around


I got a job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks
And I count the days 'tell you just might come back


But then I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding' on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you swore that you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town
Till summer comes around


Oh and I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on a Ferris wheel rocking with the motion
Hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment
And "Baby I'll be back again" you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down
'til summer comes around


I could break down and cry
Laugh it off and deny
Draw lines in the sand
And count on both hands
All the reasons why
This just won't work
It'll be nothing but hurt
I can swear that I don't
And maybe one day I won't
But for how hard I've tried


I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now


If I were 25
I know just what I'd do
I would have already kissed
Till I was drunk on your lips
A thousand times too few
But we have other lives
And we know it ain't right
This is going nowhere
If I'm with you I don't care
Take me nowhere tonight


They call it fire
But it feels just like drowning
With the weight of my burning desire
Closing in all around me
I wasn't lost until you found me


And I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now


I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

Like the fish in the lake
And that cane pole you make
And the feeling when one's on the line
Like the smile of a friend
Glad to see you again
That erases the passing of time
Like the eagle that flies
Like the sun in the sky
Or the grace God has given to me
It's free
Things I wouldn't trade for anything

Like the night we were standing
With your hand in mine
Just staring up at the stars
Dancing to something
But it wasn't nothing
But the beating of two lucky hearts
The sound of a train
The hard pouring rain
And the words that you whisper to me

All free
Things I wouldn't change for anything
Are everything
Free
Things I wouldn't trade for anything
Are everything to me

Like that penny on the ground
Or the fortune I found
When you wrapped your arms around me

Free
Things I wouldn't trade for anything
Are everything
Free
Things I wouldn't trade for anything
They're everything
Free
Things I wouldn't trade for anything
Are everything to me


West, on a plane bound west
I see her stretching out below
Land, blessed mother land
The place where I was born
Scars, yeah she’s got her scars
Sometimes it starts to worry me
Cause lose, I don’t wanna lose
Sight of who we are


From the mountains high
To the wave crashed coast
There’s a way to find
Better days I know


It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home


Free, nothing feels like free
Though it sometimes means we don’t get along
Cause same, no we're not the same
But that’s what makes us strong


From the mountains high
To the wave crashed coast
There’s a way to find
Better days I know


It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home


Brave, gotta call it brave
To chase that dream across the sea
Names, and they signed their names
For something they believed
Red, how the blood ran red
And we laid our dead in sacred ground
Just think, wonder what they think
If they could see us now


It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home


It’s been a long hard ride
And I won’t lose hope
This is still the place
That we all call home


Sun shines, Clouds rain
Train Whistles blow and Guitars Play
Preachers Preach, Framers Plow
Wishes go up and the World goes round


And I love you, It just come Natural
It just comes Natural
Seasons Change Rivers Wind
Tumble Weeds roll and the Stars shine
Wind Howls, dawn breaks
Cowboys riding' time slips away


And I love you, It just come Natural
It's what I was born to do
Don't have to think it through
Baby, it's so easy loving you
It just come Natural


It's what I was born to do
Don't have to think it Through
Baby it's so easy loving you


Fire burns Waves Crash
Seeds grow and good things last
Ships sail Dreams fly
Night falls and Full moon rise


And I love you, It just come Natural
And I love you, It just come Natural
It just come Natural
It just come Natural


You're like a sugar-sweet kiss in the morning
Sunshine pouring right into my window
Cool drink of water in the summer
Better than the other side of the pillow
You're everything that I'm not, and then a cherry on top
Yeah, girl, I gotta see you tonight
Yeah, I'm taking you out' cause damn baby I'm proud


When a guy like me
Gets a girl like you
Yeah, you better know we're going to take it downtown
Showing everybody what I'm crazy about
Anywhere we go
Gotta let 'em all know
And I'mma tattoo your name on my arm
Baby I just wanna show you off


You gotta boy feeling lucky, how you love me
And you're making my heart go
Ticking like a time bomb, baby when the top drops
And I'm watching your hair blow
No, I don't wanna miss another kiss on your lips
Yeah, girl I gotta see you tonight
Pick you up about 8, counting down I can't wait




Yeah, show you off
Oh baby I just want to show you off
When a guy like me, gets a girl like you
You better know what I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do, yeah




Yeah, show you of
Baby I just wanna show you off


Heyy
Heeey
Heey


Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you
Blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you
In every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind


Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a
Single thing you do, tonight


Just in time
I'm so glad you have
A one track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection
We can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out
My untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna
Blow your mind


Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a
Single thing you do, tonight


Way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
You're so gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me


Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a
Single thing you do, tonight


Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a
Single thing you do, tonight
Heyy
Heeey
Heey, Tonight

Heyy
Heeey
Heey, Tonight


We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due


We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried


We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way


It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all


I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long


We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way


We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way


I still change the station
Every time they play that song
Can't drive past your house
So I take the long way home
Your black leather jacket
Still hangin' in my closet
I wish that I could give it away
Oh, even though you're gone, somehow you stay


And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you


I didn't wanna be here
But my friends all love this bar
I don't wanna see you
But I'm wondering where you are
And why am I still keepin'
The shirt you used to sleep in
It's been sittin' there for over a year
Oh even though you left me you're still here


And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you


I can't shake you
No matter how hard I try
I can't shake you
I can't shake you
And I don't know why


And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you


Dang, girl, look at you stoppin' me in my boots
What's a country boy to do but say uh huh
Smile beatin' my chest up, you're downright dangerous
That shake in your giddy up got my eyes going what what


Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Oh, she's a flatliner


Dang, girl, I'm done, I ain't never seen no one
Poppin' it like a cold one and drop it down like uh huh
Oh my, see the light, I don't mean the neon kind
One kiss from you tonight and send me on to the other side


Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner


Dang, girl, look at you stoppin' me in my boots
What's a country boy to do?
What would Dierks do?
Grab a guitar and go sing her a song
And go play one of my songs?
No, don't play one of yours, play one of mine, man!


Yeah, sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner


She's a flatliner
Yeah, man, she's gonna hurt somebody
Dude, she's worth the whiskey, bro, go get her one
Yeah, she's a flatliner


We had a good run
But I knew, I knew, I knew
I knew this day would come
As bad as I want to
Ain't no way, not me girl
I ain't gonna stop you


But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby don't move
Just say my name, stay right there
I'll come running for you


I'm gonna miss you
Baby there's no way that I can go with you
So go on and chase it
I know, I know, I know
You can almost taste it
Yeah, time's a wastin'


But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby don't move
Just say my name, stay right there
I'll come running for you
Yeah, ooh


It's gonna be a long night
And I might shed a tear
But I'll a be all right
And even though you won't be in my arms
You'll be right where you belong
So go girl, go girl, go on


But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby don’t move
Just say my name, stay right there
I’ll come running for you, yeah

You got your feet squeezed into heels that hurt
Cause they go with the job and they go with the skirt
You gotta look good when you're out there
Climbing ladders

You go above and beyond and then way beyond that
You do it all, yeah, you wear every hat
Hoping someone that matters will realize you matter

But all that really matters is it's Friday
And the sun is shining over my way

Toss your heels in the backseat
Drive home in your barefeet
Throw in that Van Morrison Cd
Chip away a little by little
Til you find your groove

I'll pick up some takeout, we can just hang out
Levis and wine, blankets and lights down
Lay your head right here on my shoulder
And just be you when you're with me
Girl, you got nothing to prove

I could listen all night if you wanna talk
Or we can lay here and say nothing at all
I already know who you are and that I love you

So, baby, take a long deep breath and exhale
Cause all you gotta be tonight is yourself

Toss your heels in the backseat
Drive home in your barefeet
Throw in that Van Morrison Cd
Chip away a little by little
Til you find your groove

I'll pick up some takeout, we can just hang out
Levis and wine, blankets and lights down
Lay your head right here on my shoulder
And just be you when you're with me
Girl, you got nothing to prove
You got nothing to prove

I'll pick up some takeout, we can just hang out
Levis and wine, blankets and lights down
Lay your head right here on my shoulder
And just be you when you're with me
Girl, you got nothing to prove

When we're together you got nothing to prove
You got nothing to prove, you got nothing to prove
You got nothing to prove


Winter getting colder, summer getting warmer
Tidal wave coming 'cross the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon, it's cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singing Christmas carols


That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride


Momma gets her rocks off watching' Desperate Housewives
Daddy works his ass off paying' for the good life
Kids on the YouTube learning how to be cool
Living in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl


That's us, That's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride


Poor little infamous, America's town
She gained five pounds and lost her crown
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note


Plasma getting bigger, Jesus getting smaller
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can
If the shoe don't fit, fits gonna hit the shan


That's us, That's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Hot dog, Hot damn
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Oh yeah
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na nananananananana


Don't waste your time looking over your shoulder
Those loves from the past aren’t getting no closer
When I look in my future you're all I can see
Don't go loving on nobody but me


Nobody but me going to love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me going to cry if you up and leave
You can do what you want to
But I'm asking pretty please (Honey) don’t go loving on nobody but me


I took my time to tell you how I feel
Just because I took so long don't mean that it isn't real
I ain't got no diamond, but I'm down on my knees
Don't go loving on nobody but me


Nobody but me going to love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me going to cry if you up and leave
You can do what you want to
But I'm asking pretty please (Honey) don’t go loving on nobody but me
Nobody but me going to love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me going to cry if you up and leave
You can do what you want to
But I'm asking pretty please (Honey) don’t go loving on nobody but me


Don't go loving on nobody but me

Hey
Well you work and you slave and you spend all day in your thankless job
Then you jump in your Ford
Door to Door
With a hombound mob
Then you pull in the drive and you hit the chair
And the one you love is waitin' there

Hey, That's what it's all about
Hey, this is the life i couldn't live without
It's a moment frozen there in time
When the reasons all begin to rhyme
Where loves a little bigger and you finally start figurin' out
That's what it's all about

When they won't go to bed
And do what you said
And they eat their food
They Cry, and they Fuss and you can't Cuss
Cause they'll say it to
Your Tired, Num, Stressed and your Mad
She smiles and says I Love You Dad

Hey, That's what it's all about
Hey, this is the life i couldn't live without
It's a moment frozen there in time
When the reasons all begin to rhyme
Where loves a little bigger and you finally start figurin' out
That's what it's all about

Hey, That's what it's all about
Hey, this is the life i couldn't live without
It's a moment frozen there in time
When the reasons all begin to rhyme
Where loves a little bigger and you finally start figurin' out
That's what it's all about

Hey That's what it's all about
The life i couldn't live without
Hey That's What it's all about

That's What it's all about
That's What it's all about
That's What it's all about


One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know


People say I got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all


They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution


Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because


People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all


They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution


Just a solution


It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all


They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution


You said "I love you" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn’t believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I’ve been feelin' about you
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you


So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line


Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us


So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line


Oh, baby it's time
Oh, it's time


Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now


Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line

You were hangin' your feet off
The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swayin' in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah

It was a sweet Southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me starin' at you
But you smiled back at me
Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day

I don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video
I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy
Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford
Oh Lord, is it love?
I just can't say
(But I've)
(I've had that song in my head all day)
(Playin' in my head all day)

I said, 'How 'bout an autograph for 'ya
Your biggest fan?'
You wrote your name and your number
In the palm of my hand
My heart and that big bass speaker
Were thumpin' away, and I
I've had that song in my head all day


Too country what's that
Is it like too Republican or too Democrat
Is it too far to the left
Too far to the right
Too straight down the middle
Is it too black or too white


Are the biscuits too fluffy is the chicken too fried
Is the gravy too thick are the peas too black-eyed
Is the iced tea too sweet does it have too much tang
Are there too many lemons in mama's lemon meringue


Too country what's that
It is too many pearls of wisdom under grandpa's old hat
Is it just too old fashioned is it just too antique
Is the question too strong or the answer too weak


Are the roses too red is the sunshine too bright
Are there too many stars in the heavens at night
Are there too many fish that still jump in the stream
Is the blue sky too blue is the clean air too clean


Is the grace too amazing is the steeple too tall
Are there too many "yes sir's", "yes ma'am's"
And "how're y'all's"
Is the message too really too close to the bone
Do the fiddle and steel remind you too much of home
Is honest and true just not in demand
Too country
Too country
Too country
I don't understand


Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys kicking it back
Or the guy with a guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can
Stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that


And I’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain’t she beautiful?"
I’m invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But I don’t mind being the guy with the girl, no


It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room


And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain’t she beautiful?"
I’m invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But I don’t mind being the guy with the girl


The guy that don't know how he got her
But he ain't never gon' let her, never gon' let her go
Woah-oh, yeah


I’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain’t she beautiful?"
I’m invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But I don’t mind being the guy with the girl


(Guy with the girl)
No, I don't mind being the guy with the girl
(Guy with the girl)
Yeah, I'm just the guy with the girl
I'm always the guy with the girl
I don't mind it baby
I don't mind it baby
I'm always the guy with the girl

Their drinking on the deck down at Maggie's Margaritas
They bumper to bumper out at the marina
They've been waitin' all spring
It's a summer thing

The sun is getting right and the water is getting warmer
The days are getting longer, them shorts are getting shorter
Won't hear me complain
It's a summer thing

So grab a cerveza and everyone raise 'em
And let's all give thanks for today
We may not remember June through September
Drinking our troubles away

It's a summer thing

This little party cove ain't no Panama City
But the beer is ice-cold and our girls are just as pretty
Drivin' us boys insane
It's a summer thing

Well, the moon is coming out, but we're just getting started
We're gonna build us a fire and play some Bob Marley
And we'll all sing
It's a sumer thing

So grab a cerveza and everyone raise 'em
And let's all give thanks for today
We may not remember June through September
Drinkin' our troubles away

It's a summer thing

So grab a cerveza and everyone raise 'em
And let's all give thanks for today
We may not remember June through September
Drinkin' our troubles away

But that's okay
It's a summer thing
It's a summer thing

Here's to you, here's to me
May we never disagree
Let's raise a glass to days gone by
Here's to life, here's to life

I love you like a wild fire loves the wind
From way down in my soul out through my skin
You might say I feel it in my bones
It brings me to my knees, it lifts me up, it makes me strong
And I hold on

To every touch
Every kiss
And every moment just like this
The way you dance, the way you smile
And wear your hair just a little wild
The way you move me like you do
It's no wonder I'm in love with you

Love like this is sacred, ancient law
You wonder where I stand, I stand in awe
I’ve seen the other side of heaven's door
And every time that we make love it shakes me to the core
And I want more

Of every touch
Every kiss
And every moment just like this
To have the dance, to see you smile
And let your hair hang loose and wild
The way you do, the things you do
Girl, it's no wonder I'm in love with you

Yeah baby
I'm in love with you
Oh...

Oh… I love your face
I love your lips
I love the taste that lingers long after the kiss
The way you do me like you do
Girl, it’s no wonder I’m in love with you

It’s no wonder I’m in love… with you


Well she said she didn't love me
And kicked me out the door
Now I'm livin' in one room
And sleepin' on the floor
I think I'm gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since I'm all alone
I might as well get stoned


I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned


Every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother's gone
Another mother cries
Now I know they've got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they'd all come home
So we could all get stoned


I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got shit to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned


Might as well get stoned
Oh, might as well get stoned
Might as well get stoned


Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go


I never had something that I can't walk away from
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience
There's something 'bout you girl I just can't fight


You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you


All the in-between is killing me
You know I come unglued from missing you
Sunset eyes, no, I don't have to try
Because you know exactly what to do


I never had something that I can't walk away from (walk away from)
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience (I ain't got no patience)
There's something 'bout you I just can't fight


You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you


I'm always craving you
Craving you
Craving you


Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go


(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you, yeah
Craving you


Craving you
I'm craving you baby
I'm craving you
I'm craving you babe

She's a wild rose waiting on me at the end of the road
Between the water tower and the power lines
We're a cloud of dust once I get her buckled in my pickup truck
She's ten pounds of sugar in a five pound sack
A Hollywood looker in a John Deere cap

I go fast, she hollers faster
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

Burning the backroads, sucking jet fuel from the radio
Cows and corn fields flying by
Gate's locked, hop the fence
Sneak past the barn where the riverbank bends
She's the best skinny dipper that you're ever gonna find
She can hit the branch with her bra every time, and

I go fast, she hollers faster
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

She's ten pounds of sugar in a five pound sack
A long straight away on a quarter mile track
She got a kiss that'll hit you like a heart attack
I got the rifle she's got the rack and

I go fast, she hollers faster
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

I go fast, she hollers faster
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

I threw my bags in his back seat
Gave my mom a kiss on the cheek
Said, 'Don't worry 'bout me
I'll be fine'
My mama never liked him much
Always thought he was kinda rough
And nothin' in this world could change a girl's mind
No use tryin'

Chorus
Mom, he's a real go-getter
Love hasn't ever felt better
You won't believe all the things he's promisin' me
California, that's where we're goin'
He swears he can make a fortune
I know you don't think I should go
There's some things a mama don't know

(The money ran out in Vegas)
(She's an all-night diner waitress)
(She'll do anything just to get by)
The hardest work he's done on his big career's a
Fifth 'a whiskey and a case of beer
When I talk to mama
I lie
I've got my pride

Chorus
Mom, he's a real go-getter
Love hasn't ever felt better
You won't believe all the things he's promisin' me
California, that's where we're goin'
He swears he can make a fortune
Hope my voice don't let my secret show
Still some things a mama don't know

Like wakin' up to broken dreams every day
Like knowin' there's a little one on the way
Like believin' that someone you love can change
Like hidin' the bruises on my face
Just for everyone else's sake

Chorus
But mom, he's a real go-getter
Love hasn't ever felt better
You won't believe all the things he's promisin' me
California, that's where we're goin'
He swears he can make a fortune
Mama says, 'Baby, you can come back home'
But there's some things a mama don't know
(Hmmm) hmmm


He don't need no coat and tie
Don't need no black and white
He don't need no red, copper cameras flashing in his eyes
Oh, no
Cause his feet are on the ground
And he's grounded in his boots
My baby looks so sexy out there
Working in his boots
Oh, you should know


Oh my man
He's got them real strong hands
And after working all day
Out in that hot sunshine
He comes walking in always looking so fine
Oh my heart
Lights up like shooting stars
He’s like a knight in shining armour
With them blue jeans on
Dirty white tee
And my baby don't need no
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Don't need no
Don't need no
Tuxedo


I don't need no diamond rings
Don't need no shining car
He makes me feel so fancy
When I'm laying in his arms
Oh, you should know


Oh my man
He's got them real strong hands
And after working all day
Out in that hot sunshine
He comes walking in always looking so fine
Oh my heart
Lights up like shooting stars
He’s like a knight in shining armour
With them blue jeans on
Dirty white tee
And my baby don't need no
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Don't need no
Don't need no
Tuxedo


He's like a George Strait choir type
He knows the difference in wrong and right
And he gives me just what I like
All night
And he's mine, all mine


Oh my man
He got them real strong hands
And after working all day
Out in that hot sunshine
He comes walking in always looking so fine
Oh my heart
Lights up like shooting stars
He’s like a knight in shining armour
With them blue jeans on
Dirty white tee
And my baby don't need no
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Don't need no
Don't need no
Tuxedo


He don't need no
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Don't need no
Don't need no
Tuxedo
He don't need no

Daddy waited up
In the kitchen by himself
I came stumbling in that night
With liquor on my breath
He said son I know u live here
But this is still my home
Its my way or the highway
So I said alright Im gone

Pre chorus:
And before i slammed that door
I said i hate u
He just shook his head
And said ok

Chorus:
But u can't stop my love for u
Itll be here thats a given
As long as i am livin on this earth
One thing is true
U can turn away, forget me
Curse my name
But love will never let u go
Son my love is unconditional

Life is like a circle
Slowly turning on itself
But girl it took losing you
To finally know how bad it felt
We stood in this bedroom
A year ago today
Hangin onto pride and anger
As we threw our love away

Pre Chorus:
And before u slammed that door
U said i hate u
But tonightif u could only hear me say

Chorus:
U can't stop my love for u
Itll be here thats a given
As long as i am livin on this earth
One thing is true
U can turn away, forget me
Curse my name but love won't let me let u go
Girl always know
My love is unconditional

Tag:

U could turn away forget me
Curse my name
But you can't even let me go
Girl but you need to know
My love, is unconditional

I guess he's working late again
I don't need to wonder where he is
But I do
He oughta know that by now

I know his job takes a lot of him
There's not much left for him to give
But I need more
He oughta know that by now

It's not like he's gotta read my mind to know what I'm feelin' after all this time
It's just too hard to hold on to what's never around
He oughta know that by now

He used to promise soon things would change
It's been years and it's still the same
And that hurts
He oughta know that by now

I've grown so used to being alone
Couldn't be much worse if I were gone
And in a way I am
He oughta know that by now

It's not like he's gotta read my mind to know what I'm feelin' after all this time
It's just too hard to hold on to what is never around
He oughta know that by now

Heart ache and coffee at midnight motels
Leaving him was hard as hell
But I did
And he oughta know that by now

I didn't try to explain
No goodbye underneath my ring
That was all I left
He oughta know that by now
That was all I left
And he oughta know that by now


I don't need to be sitting on the roof
Of a high-rise looking at the city below
I don't need to be on the beach
Watching that sun sink in the Gulf of Mexico
If I climb to the top of a Colorado mountain
I could see forever from there
But I don't have to go anywhere


I've got a million dollar view
Right here in my living room
In this little tin roof house
Even with the shades pulled down
And the lights turned out
I don't need to go to some exotic place
To see the kinda thing that takes my breath away
No, all I got to do is look at you
And I've got a million dollar view


When I see you laying there in that sexy nightgown
It burns me down deep in my soul
You're a living work of art
A sight that would inspire the likes of Michelangelo
If I took a telescope and pointed it to heaven
I wouldn't find nothing up there
That compares to what I got right here




I don't need to go to some exotic place
To see the kind of thing that takes my breath away
No, all I got to do is look at you
You know the truth is, I don't know if a million would get it


You're my million dollar view
Yeah, just looking at you
You're my million dollar view


I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed "space" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you


We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you


We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ever) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh


I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, "Never say never"
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, "I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"


We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh, yeah)
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, i'm telling you why
Santa claus is coming to town

He's making a list, he's checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake


Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, i'm telling you why
Santa claus is coming to town, yeah 




Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, i'm telling you why
Santa claus is coming
Santa claus is coming to town!

Blue eyes cuttin' through the summer day
Every red light seems to come from her face
From the tip of her toes to the top of her curls
She's a hundred percent American girl

She's my sweet sun angel
Every bit of summer time
Never seen her look so fine

My sweet sun angel
If you ever see her on the street
You'll know just what she does to me

Just watch her shine
Yes, she's mine, mine, mine
She's my sweet sun angel

She's my umbrella in the pouring rain
She's my shelter in this wild, wild hurricane
Got a heaven full of stars, shinin' in her eyes
And I swear I haven't felt so good in my whole life

She's my sweet sun angel
Every bit of summer time
Never seen her look so fine

My sweet sun angel
If you ever see her on the street
You'll know just what she does to me

Just watch her shine
Yes, she's mine, mine, mine
She's my sweet sun angel

Loves me like I'm her tomorrow
And she's the light that I wanna follow
Sweet sun angel

She's my sweet sun angel
Every bit of summer time
Never seen her look so fine

My sweet sun angel
If you ever see her on the street
You'll know just what she does to me

Sweet sun angel
Every bit of summer time
Never seen her look so fine

My sweet sun angel
If you ever see her on the street
You'll know just what she does to me
My sweet sun angel


Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year


I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year


Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year


Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year


Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year
Yeah, I'm havin' a record year

O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born;
O night, O Night, O night divine!
O night, O Night, O night divine!

O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born;
O night divine!
O night, O night divine!


If she were any other woman
I wouldn't be going home right now
I'd stay out a little while longer
Put another coat of paint on this town

If she were any other woman
I'd go home just to keep the peace
But I've found she's where I find it
So that's where I want to be


If she were any other woman
She wouldn't have this hold on me
Ain't no woman like my woman
So there ain't no other man
I'd rather be


If she were any other woman
Lord knows she might of thought twice
About hanging all her dreams on a dreamer
Cause it ain't been any easy ride

If she were any other woman
No telling where I'd be right now
She keeps my head from turning
And my feet on solid ground




She wouldn't stay on my mind
Morning noon and night
She wouldn't move me like she does



Ain't no woman like my woman
So there ain't no other man
I'd rather be

Shoulda seen it coming
Shoulda know you weren't that kind of girl
Ya didn't like the life style
Ya didn't understand the cowboy's world
Lookin back I wonder
When it was I finally realised mmmmmm
No matter how you hurt me
Cowboys don't cry

Cowboys don't cry they move on
One more rodeo and a few more broken bones
Nothins better than one good eight second ride
You play you win you lose you try
Cowboys don't cry

For me it was a passion
For you it was a fashion show each day
I was boots and saddles
You were double D and santa fe
But you never said forever
So I guess you never did tell me a lie mmmmm
Honey that still hurts me


Well this town has closed down way too early and there's nothing to do
So I'm driving around in circles and I'm thinking about you
Today I heard you got a new last name
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way
And the radio just keeps on playin' all these songs about rain


Now there's all kinds of songs about babies and love that goes right
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight
Hey I hope its sunny wherever you are
That's sure not the picture tonight in my car
And it sure ain't easing my pain all these songs like


"Rainy Night In Georgia"
"Kentucky Rain"
"Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again"
Blues eyes crying in the early morning rain
They go on and on, and there's no two the same
Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain


Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe I'm not
' Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got
Guess I'll never know what could have been
Sure ain't helping this mood that I'm in
If they're gonna keep on playin' these songs like


"Rainy Night In Georgia"
"Kentucky Rain"
"Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again"
Blues eyes crying in the early morning rain
They go on and on, and there's no two the same
Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain


This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped up cars, water towers
Or drowning in a bottle of Jack
This ain't about Chevys
Ain't about money
Ain't about blue suede shoes, coo-coo-ca-choos
Got nothing to do with that


It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen
Rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Oh, blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl


Ah, it's a song about you, oh, yeah
This ain't about hometowns
Ain't about back roads
Ain't about shoulda, coulda, wish I woulda
Rear views looking back
This ain't about goodbyes
Ain't about come-backs
Oh, got nothing to do with the stars and the moon
Man, you're getting way off track


It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen
Rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Oh, blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl


Baby you, yeah you, yeah you, know who you are
Baby you, yeah you, read my lips, hear my heart
Listen to this guitar


It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen
Rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
Every time
Oh, don't think too hard
Dig too deep
Or read between the lines


It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen
Rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Oh, blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl, girl, oh
It's a song about a girl, girl, ohh, yeah
It's a song about a girl, girl, oh
It's a song about a girl


This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped up cars, water towers
Or drowning in a bottle of Jack


Sun kissed hair and not much makeup
High-heeled boots that lace up
Two first names that came from
Her grandmas on both sides
She ain't ever read much Faulkner
But she could've been his daughter
She grew up on muddy water
Southern style


Southern style, free and easy
Southern style, warm and breezy
If you met her, man believe me
You'd want her to stay a while
Says, she don't believe in strangers
Only sinners with a savior
Cause her mom and daddy raised her
Southern style


She's a Friday night light lover
A Billy Graham fan like her mother
Wants her daddy and both brothers
To walk her down the aisle
She likes oysters raw for dinner
A little Wayne and Lynyrd Skynyrd
Keeps her tan lines in the winter
Southern style


Southern style, free and easy
Southern style, warm and breezy
If you met her, man believe me
You'd want her to stay a while
Says, she don't believe in strangers
Only sinners with a savior
Cause her mom and daddy raised her
Southern style



Southern style, free and easy
Southern style, warm and breezy
If you met her, man believe me
You'd want her to stay a while
She says, she don't believe in strangers
Only sinners with a savior
Cause her mom and daddy raised her
Southern style


You can love her, you can hate her
But you're never going to change her
If you want her then you'll take her
Southern style
Southern style
Southern style
Southern style


Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see

The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 508
I saw God today


I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I Saw God Today


Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But I noticed that she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splashing down from mounting in shades of red





Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I Saw God Today

1st Verse

2nd floor, apartment 10
Countin' change to pay the rent
But you can feel when you walk in
There's somethin' priceless in there

2nd Verse

For a satellite dish and backyard slide
Family of four in a double-wide
There's so much love inside
It spills out in the yard

Chorus

I wanna live in a house like that
Where love wears out our welcome mat
And our hearts know that's where it's at
I wanna live in a house like that
Live with you in a house like that
(Loving you in a house like that)

3rd Verse

Big ol' mansion on a hill
Wanna buy you one, if I can, I will
Oh, but if I can't, you'll love me still
'Cause what matters most of all

4th Verse

Is down the road in a little shack
With a front porch swing and a garden out back
Two old people been in love like that
Since the first time they kissed

(Repeat Chorus)
Bridge

A place to watch our babies grow up
Well, you never know who might show up
When they've got babies of their own
They'll have a place that's always home

(Repeat Chorus)

The hood's up, the oil is leakin'
The bolt's broken off an' my knuckles are bleedin'
But the sun is shinin' an' the birds are singin'
An' so am I

Now my sweet, Daisy, pretty as a rose
In the back yard hangin' out clothes
'Cause that ol' Maytag's broke
An' so am I

But she love's the life we're livin'
Barefoot dancin' in the kitchen
While I'm pickin', one string missin'
An' she don't seem to mind
Lord knows, she deserves better;
Ain't got two nickels to rub together
But, sweet Daisy, long as you're happy, baby
So am I

Summer time, nights are gettin' hotter;
Sundown down by the water
I bait her hook an' slip on a bobber
So she can wet a line

They ain't bitin'; too hot I reckon
I look over at her an' she's winkin';

If she's thinkin' what I think she's thinkin':
So am I

We love the life we're livin';
It feels so good skinny-dippin'
Skinny-dippin' an' long legs kickin'
In the Missippi mud line
Lord knows, she deserves better;
Ain't got two nickels to rub together
But, sweet Daisy, long as you're happy, baby
So am I

She love's this life we're livin'
Barefoot dancin' in the kitchen
While I'm pickin', two strings missin'
An' she don't seem to mind
Lord knows, she can do better;
Ain't got two nickels to rub together
But, sweet Daisy, long as you're happy, baby
So am I

Sweet Daisy, long as you're happy, honey
So am I

Yeah, so am I

Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away, is the bluebird
Here to stay, is a new bird
He sings a love song
While we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say Are you married
We'll say No Man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows
Ain't it thrilling
Though your nose is a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

A beautiful sight were happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter
Walking in a winter
Walking in a winter, wonderland


My disposition permeates
The room when I walk in the place
I'm sorry!
By calculation I'm way too much
Pretentiously I bitch a buck
But you bought it!
I can't exceed my reputation
A small town girl with compensation
Exploitin' all my possibilities
Well don't you know I'll blaze a trail
But hell
You can come with me


What doesn't kill you
Only makes you blonder
My heels and my hotel
They just got taller
Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records
As it does on me


Historically real men prefer
The Marilyns with curls and curves
And I've got it!
Genetically or chemically
As long as it contains some bleach
I want it!

You don't need to be a fighter
Honey, just go one shade lighter
You'll acquire everything you want
When your roots grow out
And things go South
Hey, go back to the salon!


What doesn't kill you
Only makes you blonder
My heels and my hotel
They just got taller
Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records
As it does on me
What doesn't kill you
Only makes you blonder
My heels and my hotel
They just got taller
Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records
As it does on me


Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records as it does on me

Platinum
Platinum
Somethin' bout platinum

Well I Gotta Catch My Breath
When I see you walking' in
You're crawling back in my head
Stealin' the oxygen
And everyone else in here
Disappears but the two of us
And the room starts to spin
Around the Chandelier
In the buzz of the crowd
I can feel the rush
Cause your clouding up my atmosphere
Everybody's got somebody who gets them the way you got me
I still want you, I can't stop me


Girl I wanna run right to ya
Then I wanna run away
Girl, I gotta hand it to ya
You know how to make me pay
Girl, I wish I never knew ya
Cause every time I see ya standing there
Oh, feels like I'm runnin' out of air

You're hitting me like a wave
You cover me in the crash
I'm drowning in what you say
It's takin' me under fast
As you're taking me down the hall
You make it easy for me to forget
Cause you're saying everything
You know I want you to say
And I'm getting in deeper the darker it gets
And The lights go out as the surface fades
Everybody's got somebody
Who gets them the way you got me
You got me right where you want me


Girl I wanna run right to ya
Then I wanna run away
Girl, I gotta hand it to ya
You know how to make me pay
Girl, I wish I never knew ya
Cause every time I see ya standing there
Oh, feels like I'm runnin' out of air


I still want you, I can't stop me
Girl I run right to ya
Then I Wanna Run Away
Girl I gotta hand it to ya
You know how to make me pay
Girl, I wish I never knew ya
Cause every time I see ya standing there


Girl I wanna run right to ya
Then I wanna run away
Girl, I gotta hand it to ya
You know how to make me pay
Girl, I wish I never knew ya
Cause every time I see ya standing there
Oh, feels like I'm runnin' out of air

Runnin' out of air
Runnin' out of air


Well, he used to be mine
Not so very long ago
I was crazy to ever let him get away

But, girl
You should know better
Then to go bragging in my face
So forgive me
For what I'm 'bout to say


Big deal
So what
Who cares
You just got lucky
That's all it was

Shut up
Don't wanna hear another word about
Candlelight and long stem roses
And how you're falling head over heels

In love
So what
Big deal


He's perfect
I heard ya
The first ten times that you told me
(Yeah, yeah)

It's amazing
His loving
I can't believe I let him go

I regret it
There I said it
You call yourself a friend
But you just keep rubbing it in


Big deal
So what
Who cares
You just got lucky
That's all it was

I swear if I hear another word about
Candlelight and long stem roses
And how you're falling head over heels
In love
So what
Big deal


Congratulations
I'm just so happy for you
I can't contain the way I feel
Big deal


Big deal
So what
Who cares

You just got lucky
That's all it was
Shut up
Don't wanna hear another word about
Candlelight and long stem roses
And how you're falling head over heels

In love
So what
Big deal

In love
So what
Big deal

Big deal
Oh, yeah!
Big deal


Well, baby love's just one of them words that gets thrown around
Like a Jack and Coke, sitting on the bar, it gets watered down
So I ain't gonna say it, no I ain't gonna lie
If you want to known the truth, how I feel about you tonight


If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down


So baby let me look at you and see just what I got
If you were my cherry stem I'd tie you in a knot
And if I could inhale you, oh baby I'd be gone
I'd be floating round high as the Colorado sky blowing smoke rings all night long


If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down

Last call, last chance
Last dance I was ever gonna get to take


If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down
Then I'd shoot ya down


If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya


Summer coming through a rolled down window
Tearing down an almost two lane back road
Freedom and fireflies in the air

The night's still young, never going to get old
Living for today like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves, the tires in the grass
Staying on the gas like we're never coming back


It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight


Swaying back-n-forth, can't you feel the music?
Time stands still, I don't want to lose it
Her tan, her touch, her laugh
Were flying so high like we're never gonna crash


It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight


We are tonight, we are tonight
Toes in the grass with our hands up high
Dream as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight


It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight


We are tonight
Everything we want to be, yeah
We are, we are, we are tonight
Yeah
We are tonight
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hey girl what's up, looks like you're good to go
Hop in, lets ride, take it down this road
You couldn't look any hotter
Reach on back and grab a bottle
Girl, lets get this party started

You look just like a little angel baby
But I know you love a little danger, baby
Everything about you girl is just my style
You got some wild in your smile

If this crowd don't rock, we'll take it somewhere else
I won't complain if I get you to myself
Something tells me you don't care
You're up for goin anywhere
As long as that wind's blowin' through your hair

You look just like a little angel baby
But I know you love a little danger, baby
Everything about you girl is just my style
You got some wild in your smile

You might have your mom and daddy fooled
You know just how, just how to play it cool
I know something that they don't
Girl I know just what you want
Tonight We're gonna find it down this road we're on...

Cause, You look just like a little angel baby
But I know you love a little danger, baby
Everything about you girl is just my style
You look just like a little angel baby
But I know you love a little danger, baby
Everything about you girl is just my style
Yeah, you've got some wild in your smile
Some wild in your smile


He said "I'll love you til I die"
She told him "you'll forget in time"
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again


He kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years


He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today


You know she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind
This time - he's over her for good


He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today


Down where I was born was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
We raised cotton, corn, a little cane, and kids
You either lived on a farm or wish you did
Jesus always walked close by our side
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks


There's a lot about life you can learn on a bus
How to lie, how to fight, how to kiss, how to cuss
The closer we sat to the back, the smarter we got
We were poor, we were ugly, we were all best friends
Wide-eyed, baptized, and still wanting to sin
Thank God we get more than just one shot
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks


That's us, hauling hay in the field with the radio on
That's us, heading straight into town when the work was done
In my mind, I can still see us now, riding down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago


We thought tobacco and beer in a can
Was all it would take to be like our old man
But I saw how it made my momma cry
It was hunting and fishing and football games
Then it was girls, and everything changed, in our lives
Falling in and out of love, we rode in trucks


That's us with our tailgates down in the parking lot
That's us with mud on our tires when it rained a lot
In my mind, I can still see us now, riding down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago, it's a part of my soul. Yeah


Down where I was born, was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home, I'll be home
If only in my dreams
I'll be home, I'll be home
If only in my dreams

I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home, I'll be home
If only in my dreams


We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand


I can't sleep, gotta leave
The summer sun is starting to peak
Through my window, lettin' me know
Time's up, it's time that we go
Got a lead foot waiting
And a pocket full of cash
Cooler full of beer
And a little something stashed
In the back of the car, so relax
There ain't a beach too far


We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand
In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan
Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now


Oh tellin', no tellin'
Bet them lips taste like watermelon
Got that Daiquiri kiss
The kind when it hits
Makes you wanna get goin' there
Wherever that is


We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand (hell yeah!)
In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan
Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now
No, there ain't no stopping us now
There ain't no stopping us now


(Road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand)
No there ain't no stopping us now
(In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan)
There ain't no stopping us now
(Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me)
No, there ain't no stopping us now
(Gettin' wild and leavin' this town)
There ain't no stopping us now


There's a long black train coming down the line
Feeding off the souls that are lost and crying
Rails of sin, only evil remains
Watch out, brother, for that long black train
Look to the heaven's, you can look to the sky
You can find redemption staring back into your eyes
There is protection and there's peace the same:
Burning your ticket for that long black train


Because there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train


There's an engineer on that long black train
Making you wonder if the ride is worth the pain
He's just a-waiting on your heart to say:
"Let me ride on that long black train."


But you know there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train


Well, I can hear the whistle from a mile away
It sounds so good but I must stay away
That train is a beauty making everybody stare
But its only destination is the middle of nowhere


But you know there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train


I said cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train
Yeah, watch out brother for that long black train
That devil's a-driving that long black train


I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holding the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake

There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires


Cause it's a good night
To be out there soaking up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires


Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear

I tell you what we need to do is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires




And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires


Oh, I bet you think you're John Wayne
Showing up and shooting down everybody
You're classic in the wrong way
And we all know the end of the story


'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else


And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse


I bet you think you're first place
Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning


'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else


And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse


Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo


Yeah, I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
High horse
You ain’t ever gonna come down
You ain’t ever gonna come down


In these times in which we live
Where the worst of what we live
Is laid out for all the world on the front page
And the sound of someone's heartbreak
Is a sound bite at the news break
With a close shot of the tears rolling down their face
Blessed be the child who turns a loving eye
And stops to pray
For these times in which we live
In these most uncertain hours
Where the balance of power
Is a fight that is fought every day
And freedom is a word
Some cry out and some whisper
And some are just too quick to give away
Blessed be the one who stands by the one
On the battle line
For these times in which we live
Well give me a heart full of tender mercy
And arms I will open wide
For these times in which we live
Seems like the only answer is
Giving up on finding one at all
And we hide behind unsure
Pull the blinds and lock the doors
And hang a pleasant picture on the wall
Blessed is the believer who knows love is our redeemer
And the only breath of life
For these times in which we live
Well give me a heart full of tender mercy
And arms I will open wide
Yeah give me words full of loving kindness
And hands ready to hold up a light
For these times in which we live
For these times in which we live


There's a tangled mess of sheets on the bed
A lack of sleep poundin' in my head
We both regret some of the things we said
But we love the way it ends


Sometimes I think
We hurt each other just because of where it'll lead
And sometimes I think
We're fighting just to be lovers and all so needlessly


Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight


They say don't go to bed angry, that's true
But it's really something when we do
(Madder you make me, the more I want you)
Girl, I admit

[Pre-Chorus 2: Both, Demi Lovato & (Brad Paisley)
Sometimes I think
It couldn't be any better
(And I couldn't want you more)
And sometimes I think
We don't belong together
Confusing love and war


Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight


We ain't givin' up without a fight
We can make up without a fight
(No, we ain't givin' up, we can make up)


Good as we are at gettin' it on
How 'bout maybe tonight
We make up
We make up without a fight


Saw you at the football games
Everybody knew your name
Once or twice I'd see you smile at me
I was scared to ask you out
I was sure that you would turn me down
But I took that chance
Because how would that be
Then what do you know
You said you'd go and there we were


Walking barefoot down by the water
Sun was hot
But you made it hotter
Found that shade tree there by the riverbank
Sitting there, our toes all muddy
That first kiss
Was sweeter than honey
And every time that I look back
I say, man That was a good day


We all have our memories
The ones we lose
The ones we keep
The one we know we'll always hold on to
I've had my days, good and bad
But the best ones that I've has
Always seem to start and end with you


Yeah, those are the times
I know that I won't forget
Like that july 4th hugged up by the levy
You squeezed me hard
And told me you loved me
Fireworks flying
Talking our breath away


Felt like we were melting together
Thinking I could do this forever
And every time that I look back
I say, man that was a good day
When we're finished with this ride
And we on the other side
Bet we'll look back on this life


And say man that was a good day
Man that was a good day
Man that was a good day
Man that was a good day
Man that was a good day
Man that was a good day
Oh that, was a good day
Man that was a good day


I saw you at the football games
Everybody knew your name
Once or twice I'd seen you smile at me


All we do right is make love
And we both know now that ain’t enough


Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye


Baby who we are just didn’t work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt


Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain’t gotta ask you what’s wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye


Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain’t gotta ask you what’s wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Let’s kiss tomorrow goodbye

It seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
Till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were runnin' against the wind
We were young and strong, we were runnin'
Against the wind

And the years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
And I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was living to run and running to live
Never worried about paying or even how much I owed
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searching for shelter again and again
Against the wind
A little something against the wind
I found myself seeking shelter against the wind

Well those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still runnin' against the wind
Well I'm older now and still
Against the wind


July moonlight shines
Your pretty little head on my shoulder
Pull over on the side of the road
Oh my God, you're something
Like nothing I've ever seen
If I'm asleep girl, let me dream


Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
Cause that's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight


Summer honeysuckle
Leaking through a rolled down window
We both know when that seat lays back
Anything can happen
So imagine it'll never end
Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where we're meant to be



Alabama & Rebecca Lynn Howard

We were all we ever wanted
Before there was a single brick in this wall
That keeps the distance here between us
We built a life but we forgot we already had it all

When we made love, we made love
Baby, we had something
That nothing else could touch
We made love

Through the lonely that divides us
And I can feel you reachin' from the other side
Let's tear this wall down and start over
And get back to, oh that simple life

When we made love, we made love
Baby, we had something
That nothing else could touch
We made love

We're just past the doubt
Beyond the hurt
We're not too far
From where we were

When we made love, we made love
Baby, we've got something
That nothing else can touch
When we made love...


I don’t know about you
But I never come into this bar
On a Thursday before 10 o’clock
But I thought what the hell, why not?

I don’t know about you
But I never walk up and talk to
A stranger but when I saw you
I had to, I just had to


Girl, I know your favourite beer
'Cause you told me and I bought it
You can leave me sitting right here
But if you feel like talking


What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)

What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin round and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you


I don’t know about you
We can dip, we can slip out the back
Flee the scene, put your feet on my dash
Find a spot past the railroad tracks and never look back
But before that


What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)

What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin around and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you


I know you like Bud Light
I know you got blue eyes
I know you got my heart beating in this bar
Tonight we can jump in, fall into something
And the perfect place to start is


What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)

What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin around and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you


Tell me everything, tell me everything
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you
Tell me everything, tell me everything
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you


Wanna find some boy, rip his heart right out
First man I see, gonna take him down
It ain't the Christian thing
To do, they say
But someone, somewhere's gotta pay


And if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong
I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this


Broke my TV, pawned my guitar
After maxing out my credit cards
You lied much too much, and you lied again
Caught you on the couch with my best friend


And if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong
I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this


Songs like this one
That tells the whole world
Just what a jerk you are


And if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong
I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this


No, if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this


Damn these old wheels
Rolling too slow
I stare down this white line
With so far to go
Headlights keep coming
Loneliness humming along
Who poured this rain
Who made these clouds
I stare through this windshield
Thinking out loud
Time keeps on crawling
Love keeps on calling me home
I'd jump all these mountains and take to the skies
Sail through the heavens with stars in my eyes


If my heart had wings
I would fly to you and lie
Beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings


We both committed
We both agreed
You do what you have to to get what you need
Feeling you near me with so many miles in between
Lord, it isn't easy out here in the dark
To keep us together so far apart




Stuck on this circle
Spinning around
Cut loose from this rope
That's tying me down




To the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main
I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt, the only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an 'ol can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn, but from my point of view


I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame


They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin


Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for our mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame


Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here


I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)


Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee
But I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride
(RIP Robert E. Lee
But I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me
Know what I mean?) It's real, it's real
It's truth


Every now and then I get a little lost
My strings all get tangled, my wires all get crossed
Every now and then I'm right up on the edge
Dangling my toes out over the ledge
I just thank God you're here


Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
Cause when I'm a firecracker coming undone
Or when I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby you save me


It's hard loving' a man that's got a gypsy soul
I don't know how you do it, I'm not sure how you know
The perfect thing to say to save me from myself
You're the angel that believes in me like nobody else
And I thank God you do


Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
When I'm a firecracker coming undone
When I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby you save me


I know I don't tell you nearly enough
That I couldn't live one day without your love
When I'm a ship tossed around on the waves
Up on a high wire that's ready to break
When I've had just about all I can take
Baby you, baby you save me


When I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
When I'm a firecracker coming undone
When I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby you save me


Well just pass me a cold one buddy it's that time again
That neon sign says open and I'm here with all my friends
So just keep them taps a flowin' the first round's all on me
And as long as they keep pourin' 'em hey we ain't gonna leave


Well good God almighty there's a party in here
And Lord have mercy I'm thirsty pass me a beer
Been workin' all day, 'bout ready to play
I done called all my boys and they on their way
And we ain't going home 'til the sun come up
And if I'm too drunk to drive I just sleep in my truck
Won't be the first time and sure not the last
Got my eye on that blond with the heart-shaped ass
She been lookin' at me since I walked through the door
'Bout time for old Colt to twirl around the dance floor
See if she got a thing for them old cowboys who like to fight
Raise hell and make a lot of noise


Well just pass me a cold one buddy it's that time again
That neon sign says open and I'm here with all my friends
So just keep them taps a flowin' the first round's all on me
And as long as they keep pourin' 'em y'all we ain't gonna leave


Well here's the situation the blond wasn't cookin'
But she came with a friend who was just as good lookin'
So I eased on over with a bottle of Bud looked her right in the eye
Said little lady what's up?
Do you like country boys with a southern drawl
Who fish hunt and fight say yes ma'am and y'all?
If so then I might be just your type
If not what the hell darlin' I won't tell
Now me 'n' you can ease on outta here
My truck is out front I got a cooler of beer
And I'd love to take you for a bite to eat
Waffle House is still open right down the street
It's all on me I got plenty of cash
I might fight a grizzly bear for a piece of that ass
As a matter of fact run and get your friends
I'll round up the boys we can make some noise


Well just pass me a cold one buddy it's that time again
That neon sign says open and I'm here with all my friends
So just keep them taps a flowin' the first round's all on me
And as long as they keep pourin' 'em y'all we ain't gonna leave

Well just pass me a cold one buddy it's that time again
That neon sign says open and I'm here with all my friends
So just keep them taps a flowin' the first round's all on me
And as long as they keep pourin' 'em y'all we ain't gonna leave

I don't stop breathing everytime the phone rings
My heart don't race when someone's at my door
I've almost given up thinking you're ever gonna call
I don't believe in magic anymore
I just don't lie awake at night
Asking God to get you off my mind
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time

Yeah, I got to work on time again this morning
This ol' job is all that I got left
And no one even noticed I'd been crying
But at least I don't have whiskey on my breath
Yeah, I think I'm gonna make it
'Cause God won't make a mountain I can't climb
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time

God I hope you're happy
Girl I wish you well
I just might get over you
You can't ever tell

I always thought that I'd do something crazy
If I ever saw you out with someone else
But when the moment came last night, I couldn't say a word
I stood there in the dark all by myself
Yeah, I could have said a million things
But all I did was keep it locked inside
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time

It's gettin' better all the time

The day is finally here
Theres flowers everywhere
The guests are waiting with sweet anticipation
As I look down the aisle the preacher starts to smile
Church bells are ringing and the organ is playing
Im so overcome that I could cry
Im so happy
Im not the bride

Shes such a pretty thing
She don't know anything
Ain't gonna tell her that shes outta her mind
The preacher asks the question
No, I have no objection
I do, I do, I want him outta my life
Throw the rice and let those white dove fly
O happy day
Im not the bride

I need some morcaine
Throw the bouquet
Pass the champagne
Its time to celebrate
Im gonna dance this night away
O woah ya ya

The groom is getting loud
His new wife starts to shout
O this is perfect
It can only get better
There fighting in the car
Off to a real good start
His mama's cryin, arent they lovely together
Their driving away
We wave them good-bye
Close call
Free at last
Amen
Hallelujah
By the grace of God go wild
Im not the bride
Im not the bride
Im free, Im free, Im free
Im not the bride

Thank God
Mm bye bye now
Good luck girl
Your gonna need it
Ha ha ha
Ta ta

You call me up
The conversion goes in the usual way
What cha doin
Whole lot of nothin
Oh its been a long long day
And then you mention
You got this bottle of wine
You been savin for awhile
Yeah its just waitin to be opened
I can almost hear you smile
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
Id love to see you standin at my door
Your auburn hair fallin down your shoulders
Come on baby what are you waitin for
You got the wine
Ive got all night
Were only gettin older
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
You been lookin
For that little black dress
You found the perfect one today
Yeah its just hangin in the closet
You wanna wear it in the worst of ways
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
Id love to see you standin at my door
That little strap kinda fallin off your shoulder
Come on baby its what you bought it for
You got the wine
Ive got all night
Were only gettin older
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
You say the loneliness has got you down tonight
Your bodys tired and its wound up tight
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
Id love to see you standin at my door
Kick off your shoes and let me rub your shoulders
Come on baby what are you waitin for
You got the wine
Ive got all night
Were only gettin older
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
Why dont you bring it over


You hear a new song, it's your favorite
But pretty soon you'll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but


Woah, woah
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah, woah
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me


You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot and the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that


Woah, woah
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah, woah
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me

Woah, woah
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah, woah
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me


Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands
I'll say baby you know all you can say
Is come and get me


Gonna make you miss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
And oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna make you miss me


Crowded hallways are the loneliest places
For outcasts and rebels
Or anyone who just dares to be different
And you've been trying for so long
To find out where your place is
But in their narrow minds
There's no room for anyone who dares to do something different
Oh, but listen for a minute


Trust the one
Who's been where you are wishing all it was
Was sticks and stones
Those words cut deep, but they don't mean you're all alone
And you're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now
Someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible
Oh, invisible


So your confidence is quiet
To them, quiet looks like weakness
But you don't have to fight it
'Cause you're strong enough to win without a war
Every heart has a rhythm
Let yours beat out so loudly
That everyone can hear it
Yeah, I promise you don't need to hide it anymore
Oh, and never be afraid of doing something different
Dare to be something more


Trust the one
Who's been where you are wishing all it was
Was sticks and stones
Yeah, the words cut deep, but they don't mean you're all alone
And you're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more of this life than what you're feeling now
And someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible


These labels that they give you
Just 'cause they don't understand
If you look past this moment
You'll see you've got a friend
Waving a flag for who you are
And all you're gonna do
Yeah, so here's to you
And here's to anyone who's ever felt invisible


Yeah
And you're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now
And someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible
It'll be invisible

Stumbled to Bongo Java for a cup
They're out of my favorite beans: ain't that my luck?
The heater in my car's blowin' cold
Got my divorce attorney on the 'phone
Says: "Girl, I got your paper's ready."
It's the 14th of February
An' all my girlfriend's got roses

Love's really got an attitude
It'll turn you on; it'll turn on you
It's a sacred song in a wedding dress;
It's a tattoo you wake up with
But love ain't gonna make sense
It is what it is

Kroeger has exactly what I need:
Ben and Jerry's and People magazine
Walkin' in slow motion down my aisle
It's a stranger with a "C'mon, get you some" smile
He's so GQ, he could be gay
His pick up line's borderline lame;
But he's a pilot an' that's hot

Love's really got an attitude
It'll turn you on; it'll turn on you
It's a sacred song in a wedding dress;
It's a tattoo you wake up with
But love ain't gonna make sense
It is what it is

Instrumental break

Love's really got an attitude
It'll turn you on, it'll turn on you
If you have it, you can't hide it
If you want it, you can't find it
Thinking only complicates it
You can lose it, you can make it
But it ain't ever gonna make sense
It is what it is

Love's really got an attitude


He never tells me that he's sick of this house
He never says why don't you get off that couch?
He don't cost me nothing when he wants to go out
I want you to love me like my dog
He never says I need a new attitude
Him and my sister ain't always in a feud
When I leave the seat up he don't think that it's rude
I want you to love me like my dog does baby


When I come home, want you to just go crazy
He never looks at me like he might hate me
I want you to love me like my dog


He never acts like he don't care for my friends
He never asks me where in the hell have you been?
He don't play dead when I want to pet him
I want you to love me like my dog does honey
He never says "I wish you made more money"
He always thinks that pull my finger's funny
I want you to love me like my dog
He don't get mad at me and throw a major fit
When I say his sister is a bitch


When I come home, want you to just go crazy
He never looks at me like he might hate me
I want you to love me like my dog


I want you to love me like my dog does baby


Still gotta walk into a crowded room
With the radio on
Crack a smile and crack a beer like it don't bother you
Like it ain't your song, that's on


Still gotta cross the bridge to get to work
The one by her place
Make it through the 9 to 5 like it don't hurt
It goes that way


When someone stops loving you
It don't make the evening news
It don't keep the sun from rising, the clock from winding, your heart from beating, even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you


Still gotta button up your collared shirt
The one she used to button down
Sleep on the mattress where her body left a curve
Or maybe just the couch


Still gotta keep her number in your phone
In case she calls back
One night when she's drunk and all alone
Yeah you pray for that


When someone stops loving you
It don't make the evening news
It don't keep the sun from rising, the clock from winding, your heart from beating, even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you


The hardest part about it is
There ain't a switch that you can flip
'Cause you can't stop loving them


When someone stops loving you
When someone stops loving you
It don't keep the sun from rising, the clock from winding, your heart from beating, even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you
When someone stops loving you
When someone stops loving you


You got someone here wants to make it alright
Someone who loves you more than life right here
You got willing arms that'll hold you tight
A hand to lead you on through the night right here
I know your heart can get all tangled up inside
But don't you keep it to yourself


When your long day is over
And you can barely drag your feet
The weight of the world is on your shoulders
I know what you need
Bring it on home to me


You know I know you like the back of my hand
But did you know I'm going to do all that I can right here
I'm going to lie with you till you fall asleep
When the morning comes I'm still going to be right here (yes I am)
So take your worries and just drop them at the door
Baby leave it all behind




Baby let me be your safe harbor
Don't let the water come and carry you away




You got someone here wants to make it alright
Someone who loves you more than life right here

I said
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Dance the night away

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock


Oh yeah

Oh yeah we do
Yeah we all got a reason to drink
Hey, we're all in this thing together, right?
Sing it with me
Cheers

I get up and battle the day
Things don't always go my way
It might rain but that's okay
I get to come home to you
Sometimes life may get me down
And I get tired of getting kicked around
I feel lost in this maddening crowd
But I get to come home to you

You are my best friend
And you are where my heart is
And I know at the day's end
I get to come home to you

Hanging out in our old sweatshirts
You let me complain about a hard day's work
I don't know what I did to deserve
To get to come home to you

You are my best friend
And you are where my heart is
And I know at the day's end
I get to come home to you

You are my best friend
And you are where my heart is
And I know at the day's end
I get to come home to you

Yes I get to come home to you
Oh I love coming home to you


Today was gonna be the day
He'd already wrote the note
And parked that Chevrolet
At the end of that dead end road
Had his finger on the trigger
Just about to end everything
He was taking one last long breathe
When he heard his cell phone ring


And his best friend said man where you been?
We're headed down to the lake this weekend
You better not miss it 'cause buddy I swear
It won't be the same If you ain't there
And I told that girl that you like so much
You were coming along and her eyes lit up
I better let you go, man
I really hope I didn't catch you in the middle of anything
He said you kinda did but I don't mind at all
I'm glad you called


In another town down the road
In the backseat of a car
Two 18-year-olds had let a kiss go top far
He said how are we gonna have this child
When were both headed off to school?
He convinced her late one night there's only one thing to do
She was scared to death in that waiting room
When the nurse asked how far along are you
She said five weeks and just about then
Her phone lit up and his call came in


Saying baby I was wrong about everything
I've already bought you a diamond ring
We're gonna start a life, would you be my wife?
Boy or girl; pink or blue; yeah either way
All she could say as she felt those teardrops fall
I'm so glad you called


If someone you know is weighing on your mind
And needs a friend on the end of that other line
Don't hesitate what you say may seem so small
But who knows? They might be glad you called
So make the call, yeah make that call


I do not know why I act the way I do
Like I am not got a single thing to lose
Sometimes I am my own worst enemy
I guess that is just the cowboy in me

I got a life that most would love to have
But sometimes I still wake up fighting mad
At where this road I am heading down might lead
I guess that is just the cowboy in me


The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that is never satisfied
The face that is in the mirror when I do not like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that is never satisfied
The face that is in the mirror when I do not like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me


Girl I know there is times you must have thought
There am not a line you have drawn I have not crossed
But you set your mind to see this love on through
I guess that is just the cowboy in you


We ride and never worry about the fall
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all


Flame, girl you light it up
When I hear you say my name
Yeah, you know just how to start it
You shine, and I just can't wait
To get you out tonight
Yeah, you know how bad I want it


Ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
With that one stop light, no looking back
Wherever we're going, gotta get there fast


I'm talking red hot, red kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging off your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red, I'm seein' red


Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red


Damn, we can get down someplace
Just outside of town
I'll bring the bottle if you wanna
That moon, that moon ain't gonna tell on me and you
Just say the word and we're gonna


Ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
With that one stop light, no looking back
Wherever we're going, gotta get there fast


I'm talking red hot, red kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging off your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red, I'm seein' red


Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red


No, I can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head


I'm talking red hot, red kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging off your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red, I'm seein' red


Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red, I'm seein' red
I'm seein' red, red, red, red, red

Old toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums, coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed

Close your eyes and listen to the skies
All is calm and all is well
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells

Bringing old toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums, coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed

Close your eyes and listen to the skies
All is calm and all is well
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells

Bringing old toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums, coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed

My cousin Bobby’s on the county road
Pickin up trash for the car he stole
You see him in them orange clothes you’d swear he’s evil
He’s had sticky fingers since he was a kid
If it wasn’t nailed down considered it his
For the lyin cheatin dog he is he’s GOOD PEOPLE

GOOD PEOPLE they ain’t bad
GOOD PEOPLE they get ya back in a fight
Loan ya couple bucks
Buy you a beer when you’re down on your luck
Too bad their ain’t more of us GOOD PEOPLE

Girl down the street in that doublewide
She ain’t ashamed of them no tan-lines
She’s 36-24-35 and barely legal
She gotta big ‘ol tattoo on her back
All the wives on the block says she’s white trash
She may not be high class but she’s GOOD PEOPLE

GOOD PEOPLE they ain’t bad
GOOD PEOPLE they’ll bring you food when you’re sick
Feed your dog when you’re gone
Cover you up when you pass out on the lawn
Why we gotta look down on GOOD PEOPLE

GOOD PEOPLE they ain’t bad
GOOD PEOPLE give you the shirt off their back
Never steer you wrong
Go outta their way to make you feel at home
Raise hell stand up let me hear ya if you’re one of us
GOOD PEOPLE


You were that whiskey running through my veins
You were that first sweet taste of Mary Jane
All alone in the darkness watching my hands shake
But they don’t have a rehab for heartbreak

It’s your blue sundress with the strap falling off of your shoulder
It’s that all night moonlight drive, you saying baby pull over, pull over
It’s that long kiss barely coming up for air
Had to have you anytime and everywhere
So hooked on you probably never get clean and sober

Whoa, I bang my head against the moon
I bang my fist against the wall
You always used to get me high
Now all I do is crash and fall
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
Yeah you got me going through ‘em

It’s the rain on the window with your body wrapped tight around me
It's that lightning flash in your eyes make me want you so badly, madly
You’re the ghost that’s still sleeping in my bed
A song I can’t turn off in my head
You’re the perfect storm, yeah baby, and I’m still drowning

Whoa, I bang my head against the moon
I bang my fist against the wall
You always used to get me high
Now all I do is crash and fall
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
Yeah you got me going through ‘em

I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals, yeah

I bang my head against the moon
I bang my fist against the wall
You always used to get me high
Now all I do is crash and fall
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
Yeah you got me going through ‘em


Everybody we know does


Not everybody throws their empties in a truck bed
Pours sweat off forty hours for a pay check
Take it to the bank at five save a nickel, spend a dime
On living it up
Not everybody knows an outskirts sky glow
Yell turn it up sing every word of friends in low
Not everybody likes a Friday night
Covered in dust but everybody we know does


That's what we do, that's what we love
That's how we were raised, how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins, way down in our blood
Everybody we know does
Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does


Not everybody understands how we make it
Hold it together when we feel like breakin'
Not everybody knows what we're made of but
Everybody we know does


That's what we do, that's what we love
That's how we were raised, how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins, way down in our blood
Everybody we know does
Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does
Everybody we know does


Not everybody knows an outskirts sky glow
Yell turn it up sing every word of friends in low
But everybody we know does


That's what we do, that's what we love
That's how we were raised, how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins, way down in our blood
Everybody we know does
Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does


Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does


I walk downtown in my broke down shoes
To the side street pub with the bar band blues
Take a backseat at the front door table
Order me a Bud and a shot of Black Label

Closed this place down once again
Sitting here wishing you would walk right in
Down my shot, shoot my beer
I have to got to go home but I cannot stay here

It is a short, short walk down to my second home
But that boulevard gets longer when you are walking back alone


And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you


Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else


Kicking off my shoes, tumbling through the front door
Knowing too well the kind of night I am in for
Cubs got beat again on Sports Center
My bedroom is cold as my TV dinner
One more cigarette and I will kill the light
And I will lay there wishing you were sleeping at my side










Ah, somewhere else
You might end up somewhere else
Somewhere else
Hey

(Billy Kirsch / Steve Wariner)

Daddy always said he'd come back when the first snow came
Bringing treats like Santa Claus on Christmas day
Momma always said son don't you get your hopes too high
Daddy he's a dreamer reaching for the sky
Still I waited by the window at Christmas time
And I sat on the front steps as Easter rolled by
Then we moved to Arizona 'round the 4th of July
But Daddy never came I waited just the same

Chorus
And they say it never snows in Arizona
But I never stopped believing that it would
And before I'd go to sleep at night I'd look up at the desert sky
Close my eyes the same ole prayer again
I'd wake up and see the snowfall on the sand

Part of growing up for me was learning way too soon
The difference between fantasy and cold hard truth
Momma liked to say accept those things you cannot change
She was scared I 'd be like Dad and dream my life away
But in a corner of my mind I kept a place for him
Cause a promise lasts forever when you're just a kid
Yea he told me in a season he'd be back again
But Daddy never came I waited just the same

Chorus

Bridge
Last night my Father's sister called me on the phone
Said today your father passed away I thought that you should know
You were the one that he thought of as he left this world behind
He said tell my boy I'm goning to find a way to
Come and say goodbye

And they say it never snows in Arizona
But I'm looking out my window and it is
And I swear I can't believe my eyes to see the desert painted white
For a moment we're together once again
As I see the snowfall on the sand

The declaration of independence
Think I can tell you that first sentence
But then I'm lost
I can't begin to count the theories
I had pounded in my head that i forgot
I don't remember all that Spanish
Or the Gettysburg Address
But there is one speech from high school
I'll never forgot

Come on in boy, sit on down
And tell me ‘bout yourself
So you like my daughter, do you now
Yeah we think she's something else
She's her daddy's girl and her mama's world
She deserves respect, that's what she'll get, ain't it son
Now y'all run along and have some fun
I'll see you when you get back
Bet I'll be up all night
Still cleaning this gun

Well now that I'm a father
I'm scared to death one day my daughter's gonna find
That teenage boy I used to be
Who seems to have just one thing on his mind
She's growing up so fast it won't be long
‘Fore I'll have to put the fear of god
Into some kid at the door

Come on in boy, sit on down
And tell me ‘bout yourself
So you like my daughter, do you now
Yeah we think she's something else
She's her daddy's girl and her mama's world
She deserves respect, that's what she'll get, ain't it son
Now y'all run along and have some fun
I'll see you when you get back
Bet I'll be up all night
Still cleaning this gun

It's all for show, ain't nobody gonna get hurt
It's just a daddy thing, hey believe me man, it works

Come on in boy, sit on down
And tell me ‘bout yourself
So you like my daughter, do you now
Yeah we think she's something else
She's her daddy's girl and her mama's world
She deserves respect, that's what she'll get, ain't it son
Now y'all run along and have some fun
I'll see you when you get back
Bet I'll be up all night
Still cleaning this gun

Do you remember
The day I turned to you and said
I didn't like the way he was looking at you
Yeah
How he made you laugh
You just couldn't get what I was saying
It was my imagination

So do you believe me now?
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking about
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah, and me, I'm missing you way across town
So do you believe me now?

I'm kicking myself
For being the one foolish enough
Giving him the chance to step in my shoes
Oooh
He was biding his time
When he saw our love was having a moment of weakness
He was there between us

So do you believe me now?
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking about
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah, and me, I'm missing you way across town
So do you believe me now?

Oh yeah, I bet now you see the light
Oh yeah, what's the use in being right?
We're not the lonely one tonight

So do you believe me now?
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking about
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah, and me, I'm missing you way across town
So do you believe me now?

Yeah
So do you believe me now?
Yeah
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one who's holding you baby
Yeah, and me, I'm missing you way across town
So do you believe me now?


Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away


I've never been this close to anyone, or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams


I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you


The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart


Oh, it feels like the first time every time
I want to spend the whole night in your eyes


I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you




Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
Oh, girl
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Oh, every little thing that you do
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by
By you


Got us a sunset sinking into a Friday night
Got us some beer needs drinking hey and we just might
Sometimes we got to make it up as we go
But laying low ain't all that goes on 'round here


It might look a little laid back to ya
But it is not all just porches and plows
But do not let that one red light fool ya
There is always something going down
In this nothin' town


That old abandoned factory just got the wrecking ball
We threw a party in the parking lot just to watch it fall
Sometimes we got to make it up as we go
But laying low ain't all that goes on 'round here


It might look a little laid back to ya
But it is not all just porches and plows
But do not let that one red light fool ya
There is always something going down
In this nothin' town
In this nothin' town


Somebody’s backyard
Some river bank
Sometimes come on y'all
Yeah that's all it takes


It might look a little laid back to ya
But it is not all just porches and plows
But do not let that one red light fool ya
There is always something going down
In this nothin' town


There is something going down
In this nothin' town

She was in the middle of an empty dance floor
Wrapped up in a tall dark stragnger's arms
They didn't see me slip in through the shadows
And sit down at the end of the bar
She was kissin' him all over
The way she never kissed me
I knew it was her in a heartbeat
But I knew it couldn't be

She doesn't dance
And she hates dark smokey places
She doesn't own any fancy high heel shoes
Or short s*** dresses
Her hair would be up
The way that I love
Never so down and crazy
Believe me I know my baby
And she doesn't dance

The bartender said can you believe it
Man some guys have all the luck
But in a cold old world so full of pain and heartache
It's good to see somebody so in love
When they walked out together
I just sat there all alone
I thought God I hate that woman
But I love the one at home

She doesn't dance
And she hates dark smokey places
She doesn't own any fancy high heel shoes
Or short s*** dresses
Her hair would be up
The way that I love
Never so down and crazy
Believe me I know my baby
And she doesn't dance

It's like a bad movie
That's lasted too long
It's all about her
But it has to be wrong

She doesn't dance
And she hates dark smokey places
She doesn't own any fancy high heel shoes
Or short s*** dresses
Her hair would be up
The way that I love
Never so down and crazy
Believe me I know my baby
And she doesn't dance

Believe me she doesn't dance

I hope that I ain't callin too late baby
Hope you ain't close those pretty blue eyes
Have you looked out of your window lately
That moons taken up half of that sky
Whoa whoa
I'm a little bit restless
Can't get you off of my mind
Oh
I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of you right now
A little bit of you right now
Got my wheels pullin off that highway
My headlights pullin down your street
I got your song cranked up on the radio
But you ain't singing sittin next to me yeah
Whoa whoa
Girl I need you now
Walk on out
I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of you right now
Yeah
Oh I could use a little bit of your heart beat on mine
Your head on my chest all night long
I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of
Your love
Your smile
That thing you do that drives me wild
Your kiss
Your touch
I could use a little
I could use a little bit of you right now
I wanna put my arms around the little bit of you right now


I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
But baby, it's cold outside


This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
Neighbours might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm going to say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?




I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
Oh, the answer is no
Baby, it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is so vicious
Your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home
Maybe you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died




She stole my heart
Faster than a heat seeking missile on a mission
Faster than a bass to a hook when daddy's fishing
Faster than a walnut rolls off a hen house
Faster than a whiskey shot goes down down south


Ooh, I saw white lightning
Ooh, I saw white lightning


Faster than McQueen running them red lights
Faster than the Duke boys jumping that hillside
Faster than Elvis could shake, rattle, roll
Faster than the skirt flyin' up on Monroe, I said


Ooh, I saw white lightning, I said
Ooh, I saw white lightning
Ooh, I saw white lightning


Faster than #3 breaking every record
Faster than a tree dies in the desert
Faster than that bug splattered on my windshield
Faster than you die when you take too many pills


Ooh, I saw white lightning
Ooh, I saw white lightning, yeah


Alabama moonshine intoxicating this old heart
Holdin' a metal umbrella when the storm started
Oh that's what love's supposed to feel like, whoa
Oh that's what love's supposed to feel like, oh yeah
Oh yeah that's what love feels like
That's what love feels like


Ooh, I saw white lightning
Ooh, I saw white lightning

I was a slow hand
Kind you can take home to mama
I was a good man
Learned to deal with all your drama
And now you're saying we should both see other people
If that's the way you are then
I'll trade you tit for tat
Yeah, I like the sound of that

Tell your sister I'm single
Tell your mama I'm ready to mingle
Spread the word around
I'm looking for a rebound
Tell your sister I'm single

I should have known that
You're the kind for up and leaving
So, you should know that
I'm the kind for getting even
My buddy told me
You told him that he should call ya
Well, baby, that's just wrong
I won't be too far gone
I'm gonna head home

Tell your sister I'm single
Tell your mama I'm ready to mingle
Spread the word around
I'm looking for a rebound
Tell your sister I'm single

Let's keep it in the family
Yeah, you can call me daddy
Tell your sister I'm single
Tell your mama I'm ready to mingle

Spread the word around
I'm looking for a rebound
Tell your sister I'm single
Tell your sister I'm single
Tell your sister I'm single


May not know by looking at me
Who you're looking at exactly
Wonder who could that be in your stocking
Suit of red and cheeks of cherry
Looking extraordinary
Spare me cause you scare with your gawking
Hold your applause
Pick up your jaws
Call me Claus, hoah
I got the spirit of the season in me
Spreading joy and toys a'plenty
Nimbly down your chimney I'll be bumping
Give me room because I'm a packing
Only time for toys and snacking
Love to stay here yacking
But I'm humping
I got a because
No time to pause
They call me Claus


Hoah, call me Santa
Call me Kringle
Call me Old Saint Nick
All those have a beautiful ring
Pleasing is the reason
And the season's a kick
When your Santa
Baby, you got to swing
Swing, I dare ya, yeah


Hey, call me Santa
Call me Kringle
Call me Old Saint Nick
All those have a beautiful ring
Pleasing is the reason
And the season's a kick
When you Santa
Baby, you got to swing


So while in your jammies sleeping
Roof to roof I'll be a leaping
Quickly if your creepin' for a peeping
The oohs and aahs
Are all because
They call me Claus


Hold your applause
Hey, watch the paws
They call me Claus


When you see a deer you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake you think picnic
And I see a large mouth up under that log
You're probably thinking that you're going to change me
In some ways well maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what
Remember, I'm still a guy


When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy


I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by


I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, "Yeah girls he's come a long way"
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy


And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by


These days there's dudes getting facials
Manicured, waxed and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotiony hands
You can't grip a tacklebox
Yeah, with all of these men lining up to get neutered
It's hip now to be feminized
But I don't highlight my hair
I've still got a pair
Yeah, honey, I'm still a guy


Oh, my eyebrows ain't plucked
There's a gun in my truck
Oh, thank God I'm still a guy


It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle-belling
And everyone telling you
Be of good cheer
It's the most wonderful time of the year


It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And great happy meetings
When friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for roasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago


It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoe-ing
And hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year


You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new


It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes


I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless


It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'


And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless


Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I think that you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes


I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless


Oh, you know it, baby


Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah


I'm changing lanes and talking on the phone
I'm driving way too fast
And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of coming in last
But somewhere in the race we run
We're coming undone


Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
'Cause days go by, oh, ooh, ooh


Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights running through a river of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
We're losing ourselves


Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
And days go by, oh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, the days go by, oh, ooh, ooh


We think about tomorrow, then it slips away
Oh, yes it does
We talk about forever but we've only got today


And the days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window
As the cars go by
It's all we've been given
So you better start living
You better start living
Better start living right now


'Cause days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
The cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
'Cause days go by, oh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, 'cause days go by, oh, ooh, ooh


Oh, so take them by the hand
They're yours and mine
Take them by the hand
And live your life
Take them by the hand
Don't let them all fly by
Come on, come on now
Yeah, come on, oh, ooh, ooh
Don't you know the days go by?


If I had just one tear running down your cheek
Maybe I could cope maybe I'd get some sleep
If I had just one moment at your expense
Maybe all my misery would be well spent, yeah


Could you cry a little?
Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
I gave, now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me


If your love could be caged
Honey I would hold the key
And conceal it underneath
The pile of lies you handed me
And you'd hunt those lies
They'd be all you'd ever find
And that'd be all you'd have to know
For me to be fine, yeah


Can you cry a little?
Die just a little
And baby I would feel just a little less pain
I gave, now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me


Give it up baby
I hear you're doing fine
Nothing's going save me
I can see it it your eyes
Some kind of heartache
Honey, give it a try
I don't want pity
I just want what is mine, yeah


Could you cry a little?
Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
I gave, now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me, yeah


Cry just a little for me
Oh whoa, could you cry a little for me?
Yeah, yeah


I should have stolen every moment
Now there's a page
With not enough on it
Where we belong
I guess I'll never understand it
Why do we take it all for granted
Until it's gone
'Cause then it's gone


Love who you love
With all that you have
And don't waste the time
That flies so fast
Love who you love
And say that you do
Hold on as tight as they'll let you
Love who you love


Give all you've got
Like it's your last day
Your heart and soul
Before it's too late
And pull them in so close
Enough that they can feel it
With every single breath that
You're breathing
Breathe it in again and again


Love who you love
With all that you have
And don't waste the time
That flies so fast
Love who you love
And say that you do
Hold on as tight as they'll let you
Love who you love
Hold on, hold on
Yeah, love who you love
Say that you do -- yeah


Love who you love
With all that you have
And don't waste the time
That flies so fast
Love who you love
And say that you do
Hold on as tight as they'll let you
Love who you love
Yeah, love
Love who you love
Say that you do
Hold on, keep on holdin' on yeah
Yeah, with every single breath
You're breathing


Well they say the sea is rising, well that's alright with me
'Cause there ain't no other place than on the sea I'd rather be
And that second comet's coming, it's right around the bend
And some day could be any day, this world is gonna end
But that's alright, and that's okay
There ain't nothin we can do about the whole thing anyway


It's a hang on kinda ride, we're spinning through space and time
Rocking this big old rock just tryna have some fun
So let's drink another beer, here's to another year
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun


We're all swimming in a fish bowl, just floating through the sky
Pulled along by gravity and nobody knows why
So it's a Cosmic Hallelujah, that we're sitting here right now
And Becky's at the bar buying us all another round
And that's okay, yeah that's alright
I ain't gonna over think or overanalyze tonight


It's a hang on kinda ride, we're spinning through space and time
Rocking this big old rock just tryna have some fun
So let's drink another beer, here's to another year
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun


We're just hands up, roller coaster, flying with no breaks
We're just speck up, salt rolling down a tidal wave
We're just Babe Ruth, baseball hit over the wall
We're just a drop of, rain over a waterfall


It's a hang on kinda ride, we're spinning through space and time
Rocking this big old rock just tryna have some fun
So let's drink another beer, here's to another year
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun


This winter's night
Stars shine like silver bells
This winter's night
The mistletoe kiss and tell
Snowflakes fall like frosting
And I sit on the street
Strangers look like neighbors
With every smile that you meet


But here in my arms I'll keep you warm
And hold you tight
On this winter's night
(We'll look back on the year)
On this winter's night
(We'll count our blessings)
On this Winter's night
We will remember


This winter's night
Icicle lights will trim the tree
This winter's night
Wrapped a present or two from you and me
Tuck our children into bed
And dream the night away
Till the sun dawns in the morning
With the joy of Christmas day




The wise men heard the angels sing
And Him like soft and robe
The king became a child a long long time ago
And the child became a king
So the whole wide world will know
What Christmas really is


Runnin round in this new truck
Bank lets me borrow from month to month
I'm runnin out of credit, find a little Cash on the radio
Standin still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin NASCAR fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know?
'Cause where I come from, only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy


Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this


Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here
Cause


Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this


Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road, I miss corn growin in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows, there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town routes, walkin around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof
It's time we head on back


Cause meanwhile back at Mama's
The for sale sign's goin up and I'm gonna
Dump this truck and the little I got
On a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge
Goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin on the ridge
Baby tell me what you think about this


Me and you back at Mama's
Yeah me and you back at Mama's

Your face lights up every time
We talk about that one red light town
You grew up in

Your mind goes racin' down that road
And another memory takes a hold and you're smilin'
Like you're there again

You're cruising through that parking lot
With a couple friends hanging out the top
And you remember how it felt being young, wild, crazy
Baby

I wanna be that feeling
I wanna be that wind blowing through your hair
When life was like your favorite song
And those summer days went on and on
And it felt like you could do no wrong
I wanna be that feeling

I wanna be a time ablaze
That always takes your breath away
Someday, when you're lookin' back

I wanna be a picture there
In your mind that you take everywhere, that warms your heart
And makes you laugh

Yeah baby these are the good old days
Let's make it last, what do you say?
Remember being young, wild, crazy
Baby

I wanna be that feeling
I wanna be that wind blowing through your hair
Those Friday nights you were livin' for
And that first boyfriend knockin' at your door
And everyday made you want him more
I wanna be that feeling

Yeah, when life was like your favorite song
And those summer days went on and on
And it felt like you could do no wrong
That long lost feeling

Those Friday nights you were livin' for
And that first boyfriend knockin' at your door
And everyday made you want him more
I wanna be that feeling
I wanna be that feeling
Yeah yeah
I wanna be that feeling

I can be your rock hard headed fool
Stubborn as a two dollar 4-mule
Hard to handle as your granddad's tools
But I could be the one

I can be as loud as an F-16
I got a river wide redneck streak
Yeah, I can be a fool born SOB
But I could be the one

I could be the one that's the one for you
I could be your one crazy dream come true
I could be the arms, I could be the heart
I could be the love you could fall into

With somebody like you with me
There ain't no telling what I could be
'Cause you could be a star, you could even be the sun
But I could be the one

I could be a too much tequila mistake
Or I could be your heart's big lucky break
Might be a little more than you can take
But I could be the one

I could be the one that's the one for you
I could be your one crazy dream come true
I could be the arms, I could be the heart
I could be the love you could fall into

With somebody like you with me
There ain't no telling what I could be
'Cause you could be a star, you could even be the sun
But I could be the one

Yeah, with somebody like you with me
There ain't no telling what I could be
You could be a star, you could even be the sun
But I could be the one

Yeah, you could be a star, you could even be the sun
But I could be the one
Yeah I could be the one


She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there that she'd be discovered someday
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them, as she brought them to their feet


She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where
She sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star


She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawling all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small time town was hers


She doesn't care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down
They only thought she entertains is where they are and where she is now
All her old neighbors swear their certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you are going unless you got something they have not got


So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus and the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us
She's a big star as she eats caviar just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star
She's a big star


It's 3 AM and I finally say
I'm sorry for actin' that way
I didn't really mean to make you cry
Oh, baby, sometimes I wonder why


Does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say "I love you"?
Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?


I know I'd never let you walk away
So why do I push you 'til you break?
And why are you always on the verge of goodbye
Before I'll show you how I really feel inside?


Why does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say "I love you"?
And why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?




Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?

Go!

We headed out of Kansas in a flatbed Ford
Just a couple hundred dollars, you an' me an' the Lord
We didn't know where we were goin'
We just knew we had to go
Anywhere was better than "Truvy's Hair and Nails"
An' workin' at a single pump Texaco

And maybe it's crazy and we should've planned better
Saved a little money from the little we'd made
Guess we shoulda waited for a better moment
Never taken that chance and played it safe
Sometimes you've got to dance with danger
An' sometimes you've got to face your fears
What's your life if you ain't gonna live it?
Nothing but a few short years
All right

Well, I got a job in Pittsburgh working in a steel mill
And if they hadn't gone busted, I guess we'd be there still
We had a desperate situation laying in our laps
Girl, I thought that you were kidding
When you looked at me and said:
"Let's just throw a dart at that old road map"

And maybe it's crazy and we should've planned better
Saved a little money from the little we'd made
Guess we shoulda waited for a better moment
Never taken that chance and played it safe
Sometimes you've got to dance with danger
An' sometimes you've got to face your fears
An' what's your life if you ain't gonna live it?
Nothing but a few short years

Here we are by our little Coleman camper, dancing by the light of the KOA
Ain't it somethin' how we made it and we'd give it all back
Just to chase a promise of a brand new day?

And maybe it's crazy and we should've planned better
Saved a little money from the little we'd made
Guess we shoulda waited for a better moment
Never taken that chance and played it safe
Sometimes you've got to dance with danger
An' sometimes you've got to face your fears
An' what's your life if you ain't gonna live it?
Nothing but a few short years

A few short years

Yeah, baby


Well this heart of mine has been hardened like a stone
It might take some time to get back what is gone
But I'm moving on and you don't haunt my dreams
Like you did before
Oh, when I would curse your name
Hey!
Well I heard the news that you were back in town
Just passing through to claim your lost and found
But I'm over you and there ain't nothing there
That you could say or do to take what you did back
Well you got nerve to waltz right in
And think what's mine is yours again


Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
But now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore
Oh no


Well baby you can try to tell me how it is
And try to justify everything you did
But honey I'm no fool
Oh, and I've been down this road
Too many times with you
I think it's best you go
Well I got one thing left to say
Is you can lay in the bed you've made


Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
Oh should've known
Now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore


Oh no
That love don't live here anymore
Oh no, no
Sugar no, no
And you don't live here anymore
And love don't live here anymore
And since you walked out of my door
Love don't live here
Love don't live here, girl
Oh, love don't live here anymore

I was playin Santa Claus downtown on Christmas Eve
When a little girl of three or four climbed up onto my knee
I could tell she had a Christmas Wish behind those eyes of blue
So I asked her what's your name, and what can Santa git for you
She said my name is Christmas Carol, I was born on Christmas Day
I dont know who my daddy is, and mommy's gone away
All I want for Christmas is someone to take me home
Does anybody want a Christmas Carol of their own

Well all I could say was "Santa will do the best he could"
And I set her down and told her "now to remember to be good"
She said I will then walked away, turned and waved goodbye
And Im glad she wasent close enough to see ole Santa Cry

She said my name is Christmas Carol, I was born on Christmas Day
I dont know who my daddy is, and mommy's gone away
All I want for Christmas is someone to take me home
Does anybody want a Christmas Carol of their own

Early Christmas morning I got up and dialed the phone
I made a few arrangements at the County Children's home
And they told me it would be alright to pick her up today
Now my little Christmas Carol won't ever have to say

My name is Christmas Carol, I was born on Christmas Day
I dont know who my daddy is, and mommy's gone away
All I want for Christmas is someone to take me home
Does anybody want a Christmas Carol of their own

Well Merry Christmas Carol, I love you, Welcome Home

I can stand with the weight of the world
On my shoulders
I can fight with the toughest of the tough
I can laugh in the face
Of all my insecurities
Anytime, anywhere, anything
I'm strong enough

But when you're holding me like this
I'm carelessly lost in your touch
I'm completely defenseless
Baby, it's almost too much
I'm helplessly, hopelessly, recklessly
Falling in love

So let consequence do what it will to us
I don't care
Let the stars stand as witness to it all
Say the word and tonight I will follow you anywhere
I just can't pretend anymore
I'm too sturdy to fall

'Cause when you're holding me like this
I'm carelessly lost in your touch
I'm completely defenseless
Baby, it's almost too much
I'm helplessly, hopelessly, recklessly
Falling in love

I am not afraid
I am not afraid...

'Cause when you're holding me like this
I'm carelessly lost in your touch
I'm completely defenseless
Baby, it's almost too much
I'm helplessly, hopelessly, recklessly
Falling...
(Helplessly, hopelessly, recklessly)
I'm helplessly, hopelessly, recklessly
Falling in love


Old man knocked on my front door
With my teenage boy and a couple more
From up the road
He had him by the collar
Said he caught him shooting beer bottles
Down in the huller and smoking
I said is that right
He said, they won't speak when spoken to
So which one here belongs to you
And I know one does
Because they all started running
To your back forty
When they saw me coming on my gator
I looked in them in the eyes
And I said, he's mine that one
Got a wild-hair side and then some
There's no surprise what he's done
He's ever last bit of my old man's son
If you knew me then
There'd be no question in your mind
You know he's mine
Yeah he is
Friday night football games
I was living for the speakers
To call the name
On the back of number thirty-seven
Just one-forty-five
And five foot eleven, Maybe
Limelight barely shined on him
But everyone still remembers when
He whooped up on that boy way bigger
For taking that cheap shot on our little kicker
And they threw him out
Aw man, you should, you should heard me shout
I yelled he's mine that one
Got a wild-hair side and then some
It's no surprise what he's done
He's ever last last bit of my old man's son
And I'll take the blame
And claim him every time
Yeah man, he's mine and he'll always be
The best thing that ever happened to me
You can't turn it off like electricity
I love him unconditionally
I'll take the blame
And claim him every time
Yeah, y'all, he's mine
I thank God, he's mine


Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you won’t say the words that i want but you flirt when you’re drinkin’
I see those bubbles pop up like you’re texting then they disappear
Lets cut through the shit then let’s get to what we’re doing here


Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand


Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause i’m tired of asking myself


Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand


Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number I should wash right off my hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand


Looks like an angel, so picturesque
Looks like she walked right out of the wild, wild west
She's a devil in a satin dress
You don't even know her hair trigger's aimin' right at your chest
By the time you figure out that she gave you the runaround
You won't know where she's at
She's a tumbleweed blowin' in the wind come sundown
Call a girl like that


Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, knock the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away


You'll see her name, alive or dead
Yeah but take her either way cause she's wanted
If I were you, I'd place my bet
That she's ridin' off out into the sunset
With her long hair flyin' 'cross the desert dirt
Let me tell you, boy, you're never gonna catch her


Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, knock the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Oh baby, run away


Young gunslinger makin' new amends
Tough as nails under that corset
Call her renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway


Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away
She's a renegade

There's a little cafe' on the corner of town
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down
It ain't very much but she brings home
The bacon and the bread
We got a mortgage we pay just a little bit on
But it seems like all of our money is gone
Before we get a chance to get ahead
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff

Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age
Small stuff
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff
So we don't sweat the small stuff

There's a little bitty hole in the ceiling above
Sometimes the rain drips down on our temple of love
We have to put a pot smack dab in the middle of the bed
Somebody hit my car at the diner last night
Had to drive it home with one taillight
When I went out this morning, the engine was dead
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff

Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age
Small stuff
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff
So we don't sweat the small stuff

There's a little cafe' on the corner of town
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down
And she don't sweat the small stuff...


Saturday morning at a treehouse meeting in our backyard
Over Kool-Aid and crackers
You could hear through the laughter just how smart they are
With crayons they wrote down the things they believed
Oh the wisdom in first grade philosophy


Love lasts forever
Mom and Daddies stay together
Cheaters never win
And a promise is something you keep
It's bad to lie, it's okay to cry
Dreams never die
Faith is all you need
Ain't it crazy what children believe


Sometimes I wish I didn't know now
What I didn't know then
When my world was so small
Back before all of this trouble we're in
When right and wrong mattered
And truth was in style
And hope could be seen through the eyes of a child


Love lasts forever
Mom and Daddies stay together
Cheaters never win
And a promise is something you keep
It's bad to lie, it's okay to cry
Dreams never die
Faith is all you need
Ain't it crazy what children believe



A world without hate
Where people still care
What a wonderful place this would be
If we lived where


Love lasts forever
Mom and Daddies stay together
Cheaters never win
And a promise is something you keep
It's bad to lie, it's okay to cry
Dreams never die
Faith is all you need
Ain't it crazy what children believe


It's amazing what children believe

I know you're flipping through the channels and there's nothing on
And the radio ain't playing none of your favorite songs
I know the cars driving by have got you thinking about
What might be going on just a few streets down

I'm hanging around if you're hanging around
If you're staying at home, if you're painting the town
If you want to talk, you can give me a call
Or if you really don't feel like talking at all
If you're drinking a beer, I'm drinking a beer
Just get in a cab and get over here
If you want some fun, if you're needing a buzz
We've got all night, baby if you're up or hanging around
Oh, I'm hanging around

You can leave in the morning or later tonight
You don't have to call tomorrow if it ain't feeling right
No you don't have to worry if it's gonna last
There ain't gotta be any strings attached

I'm hanging around if you're hanging around
If you're staying at home, if you're painting the town
If you want to talk, you can give me a call
Or if you really don't feel like talking at all
If you're drinking a beer, I'm drinking a beer
Just get in a cab and get over here
If you want some fun, if you're needing a buzz
We've got all night, baby if you're up or hanging around
I'm hanging around, yeah

I'm hanging around if you're hanging around
If you're staying at home, if you're painting the town
If you want to talk, you can give me a call
Or if you really don't feel like talking at all
If you're drinking a beer, I'm drinking a beer
Just get in a cab and get over here
If you want some fun, if you're needing a buzz
We've got all night, baby if you're up or hanging around
Oh, I'm hanging around

You go to work
I know that's what a man's supposed to do
But sometimes you're so tired when you get home
You're not much fun to talk to

Saturdays
You kick that old lawn mower till it starts
Then patiently you turn it off and on
Dodgin' toys in the back yard
You smile, when you pass the kitchen window

And I, I think you're beautiful
My world would be an empty place
Without your touch, without your face
And I see the man you are
An' everything you want to be
And how you love the things
That mean the most to me;
I think you're beautiful

You don't mind
When my sister calls me every Friday night
About the time we turn the movie on
Just to talk about her love life
And your little boy says one day he'll drink coffee just like you
You say it makes you better knowing he
Watches everything that you do
Sometimes you don't understand me but you try, and...

And I think you're beautiful
My world would be an empty place
Without your touch, without your face
And I see the man you are
An' everything you want to be
And how you love the things
That mean the most to me;
I think you're beautiful

And I'm not sure why I deserve this life
But I'm so thankful that it's mine

I think you're beautiful
My world would be an empty place
Without your touch, without your face
And I see the man you are
And everything you want to be
And how you love the things
That mean the most to me;
I think you're beautiful

I think you're beautiful. (Beautiful. Beautiful.)
Beautiful


I came home to an empty house
And I found your little note
"Don't wait up for me tonight"
And that was all she wrote
Do you think I don't know that you're out on the town
With all of your high-rolling friends?
What do you do when you come up empty?
Where do you go when the party ends?


And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
I don't know what you were dreaming of
Somehow you forgot about love
And you were just too busy being fabulous, uh-huh


A little time in the country
A day or two to slow down
A bottle of wine and a walk in the moonlight
Maybe some fooling around
But you think time is just a magazine
And money's just a thrill
I've waited so long for you to change your way of living
Now I realize that you never will




You tell a joke and everybody's laughing
That's something you know how to do
You've always been the life of the party
But now my baby, the joke is on you
Because you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
Running after something that never comes
What in the world are you running from?
And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
To drink the wine from your winner's cup
To notice the children were growing up


And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy, too busy
Too busy
Aw, baby


Baby where are you going now?
Do you ever really know?
Oh you hate to be tied down
But you hate to sleep alone


I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me


Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me


Are you driving up the coast?
Are you wearing any shoes?
Did you  outrun all your ghosts?
Like you were always tryna do...


I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me


Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me

Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me


Yeah I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me

Yeah, Jenny was the kind you'd call up late
For a date on Friday night
Didn't never matter how much I had to drink
She come and give me a ride

Yeah, Becky was a hell-raising, dart-throwing girl
That could match me beer for beer
Ally was a singer with stars in her eyes
And Mary was the marrying kind

Gretchen was a grad student working on her masters
A little too smart for me
Tammy was a teacher, her daddy was a preacher
Evil as a girl could be

Yeah, Megan was a millionaire, senator's daughter
My collar was too damn blue
Miss Virginia sure was fine
But Mary was the marrying kind

Oh Mary, Mary
Couldn't see it at the time
Oh Mary, Mary
How could I've been so blind?

Mary was a blond-haired, blue-eyed girl next door
With an angel face
I figured I could find her wild side
So I took her on a couple of dates

She was sweet and smart, a queen-size heart
Nothing like the other girls
She just laughed at my best line
Cause Mary was the marrying kind

Oh Mary, Mary
Couldn't see it at the time
Oh Mary, Mary
How could I've been so blind?

Cause she was something different
I didn't know what I was missing
My best friend proved what I already knew
Mary was the marrying kind, yeah

Oh Mary, Mary
Couldn't see it at the time
Oh Mary, Mary
How could I've been so blind?

Oh Mary, Mary
Couldn't see it at the time
Oh Mary, Mary
How could I've been so blind?

How could I've been so blind?
How could I've been so blind?
Oh, I didn't see it
Babe, I didn't see it
How could I've been so blind?

I need to sit and talk to you and open up my heart
I can feel it comin' up from the deepest part
I guess I am tryin' to say I love you, I'm callin' out
Can you hear me now

(Chorus)
Can you hear it in a whisper
Can you hear it when I shout it loud
Can you hear it in the way I try to say
I feel about you and don't know how
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now

I never had a way with words so I haven't said
What I'm getting closer to the closer we get
I think I'm tryin to say I love you ain't no doubt
Can you hear me now

(Chorus)
Can you hear it in a whisper
Can you hear it when I shout it loud
Can you hear it in the way I try to say
I feel about you and don't know how
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now

It really isn't such a meticulous thing
We shouldn't have to work this hard
It can get to be a ridiculous thing
When you let it go this far
I love you
I said I love you

I said I love you
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now


You turn on the light, then you turn it back off
’Cause sleeping alone, yeah it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink, it's the click of the clock
And you're wondering if I'm sleeping
You heard from your friends that I'm doing okay
And you're thinking that maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know, but I don't wanna know
How you're feeling


Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself


If you see me out and I'm standing alone
Well, it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss
So...


Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself


Yea, when you're drunk, and it's late
And you're sad, and you hate
Going home alone ’Cause you're missing me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself

What if I rolled the dial to the right
And let that minor chord steer this night
What if I slid a match and lit the wick
What if I shut you up
With my lips on your lips

Let the gravel in my voice
Drown out all the noise

With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls (oh)
Hear what can start with a whisper

And what if that
Kitchen table gets wrecked
Yeah, plates crashing down
With my breath on your neck
What if that $75.94
You spent at the store
Takes the rest of the night off
As it slides to the floor

With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls (oh)
Hear what can start with a whisper
Oh, with a whisper, yeah

Let the gravel in my voice
Drown out all the noise

With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls (oh)
Hear what can start with a whisper
With a whisper, yeah
With a whisper

Yeah, hear what can start with a whisper

Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hanging off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip

Don't stop girl, you know I love it when you get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on (shine on)
Baby get your shine on

Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Riding high, roll up on the down low
Feeling lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here

And get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on (shine on)
Baby get your shine on

Homemade jar of lemon drop take a sip
Don't stop girl...

You know I love it when you get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on (shine on)
Baby get your shine on

Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on (shine on)
Baby get your shine on
Baby get your shine on

Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hanging off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chromed piece tucked in the console
Riding high, roll up on the down low
Baby get your shine on

I'm just a country boy
And, yes, I do enjoy
Showing them city folk my hell-raising ways
Valet my muddy truck
In a highfalutin club
I holler howdy just to see what they say

They say wo o a wo o

So put your Gucci shoes up
And pull your roller cases out

We're gonna have a hell raising time
Yeah Wer'e gonna party like cowboys tonight
Sayin' wo o a wo o

I keep on tipping till they play some Hank
And when they finally do

By closing time they're all talking that twang

Sayin' wo o a wo o
Country done come to town
So put your Gucci shoes up
And pull your roller cases out

We're gonna have a hell raising time

She's Says. . 
You know the monkey bar rules
As she kisses away his playground bruise
You don't have to skip a bar each time
To make it to the other side
She picked him up out of the sand
And tied the shoelace that read superman

(chorus)
We all fall down
It's the getting back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
And life there's only one garuntee
You're feet won't always be on the ground
Cause we all fall down

She says. . 
I know what you're going through
She talks through the door of her daughter's room
Your heart feels like it broken in two
Well Baby I'm here for you
The door opened and she stepped inside
She put her arms around her and said
"It's okay to cry"

(chorus)
We all fall down
It's the getting back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
And life there's only one garuntee
You're feet won't always be on the ground
Cause we all fall down

He's 45 and his job is gone
He's at his desk then heads on home
He sees his kids out playing in the yard
It's been a while since he's been hit so hard
He's as scared as a man can be
He tells his wife and she says
"Honey look at me"

(chorus)
We all fall down
It's the getting back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
And life there's only one garuntee
You're feet won't always be on the ground
Cause we all fall down

We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down


She’d rather wear a pair of cutoff jeans
Than a fancy evening dress
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around, she’s a hot southern mess
She’ll take a beer over white wine
And a campfire over candle light
And when it comes to love, oh her idea of a romantic night


Is listening to old Alabama, driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night
And she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee!


And now we’re rolling down an old back road
I got the steering wheel in one hand
We’ll find a hideaway where she and I can play
In Mother Nature’s band


Now we’re listening to old Alabama
Parked somewhere in Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And It’s Love In The First Degree-ee-Eee!


Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane
Or some old Righteous Brothers song
And Barry White is not going to work tonight
If you really want to turn her on
Play some back home come on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that’s where music has to start


Now we’re listening to Old Alabama
And we’re driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And its Love in the First Degree

Yeah’ you know we’re listening to Old Alabama (old Alabama) driving through Tennessee (Tennessee)
A little Why Lady Why at The Right Time of The Night
Oh and she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee


Oh, play me some old Alabama
Oh, play me some old Alabama
Won’t you play me some old Alabama
Play me some old Alabama
Won’t you play-ee-ay-ay
Yeee-haw!!!


Now girl I know you used to the same old same
But we ain't floatin' that boat, no we ain't ridin' that train
Hop on my rocket ship and let's get outta here
Let me put a little shimmer in your atmosphere


Now let's get outta this town, outta this club
Girl whatever you're sippin' I'ma mix it up
Take a few tick tocks off of your clock
Put a little Third Rock in your hip-hop
I got that


1994, Joe Diffie comin' out my radio

Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
We're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress


Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in, we'll just sail away


But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke


Well, Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the pen
From two to five, five to ten and longer
And Brenda's traded, smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's 'bout to graduate from college


I'm just flicking ash into the tray
Tell them both it'll be okay


But I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah (Hey yeah)
I'm out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke


We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake


Wipe down the bar, take out the trash
Light one up and count my cash
Swear I'm never coming back again


I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

I have stumbled on the plains
Staggered in the wind
Stood at a crossroad or two
Cried to a river
Swept to the sea
All just to get to you

I have jumped a yellow cab
Hopped a rusty freight
Sang till my lips turned blue
Flown a silver bird
On the tops of the clouds
All just to get to you

Now, I ran too hard
I played too rough
I gave my love
Not near enough
I bled too red
I cried too blue
I beat my fist
Against the moon
All just to get to you

I have run from St. Paul
To Wichita Falls
Called you from sunny Baton Rouge
I hocked everything
From my watch to my ring
All just to get to you

I ran too hard
And I played too Rough
I gave my love
Not near enough
I bled too red
I cried too blue
I beat my fist
Against the moon
All just to get to you

From the California Shore
Where the mighty ocean roars
To the lands of the Hopi and the Sioux
I walked the desert sands
Crossed the Rio Grande
All just to get to you

I have stumbled on the plains
Staggered in the wind
Stood at a crossroad or two
Cried to a river
Swept to the sea
All just to get to you

I ran too hard
And I played too Rough
I gave my love
Not near enough
I bled too red
And I cried too blue
I beat my fist
Against the moon
All just to get to you

All just to get to you
All just to get to you


Don't get me wrong, it's pretty cool to be on TV
So all the folks back home can see me
And that I'm livin' it out
All the things I used to dream about
Yeah, it's pretty great, singin' on a stage
Proud 'cause there ain't an empty seat in the place
But, girl, ever since I met you
I got a whole new perspective


If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
Nothin' wrong with the center of attention
Long as I'm with you, I don't mind the pictures
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you


Yeah, I hope the first question people ask me
Is "How's your girl and how's your family?"
I could go on and on and on
Talkin' 'bout you for days
You can bet when I hear, "Congratulations"
Want it to be because we made it
Another five years
Best thing I got is right here


If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
Nothin' wrong with the center of attention
Long as I'm with you, I don't mind the pictures
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Ooh, famous for lovin' you
Ooh


If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
And if I'm gonna go down in history
I hope it's all 'cause of you and me
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you

You've always been a friend of mine
That's the way we'll be 'til the day I die
Yeah it's good to know you're on my side
'Cause now you know she's leavin' me
And I need your help to make her see
So turn on your charm and let it shine

'Cause you've always been the one
Who could make her stay around
So when she gets to the city limits sign
Don't let me down

Woah, Laredo
Don't let her go
Just take her by the heart and let the wheels turn slow
Woah, Laredo
You're my only hope
So get her back to the day we met
'Cause that's as far as she needs to get
Oh, but please don't let her go
Oh, Laredo

Make her think about the moonlit walks and the long, long talks
By the water's edge
With her feet hangin' off the cane creek bridge
Bring to mind the first kiss we shared at the old town square
When she drives down there
'Cause that's the day she said she could never forget
Keep the nights by the candlelight as an ace in the hole
'Cause those are nights of passion that I know will bring her home

Woah, Laredo
Don't let her go
Just take her by the heart and let the wheels turn slow
Woah, Laredo
You're my only hope
So get her back to the day we met
'Cause that's as far as she needs to get
Oh, but please don't let her go
Oh, Laredo

Woah, Laredo
Don't let her go
Just take her by the heart and let the wheels turn slow
Woah, Laredo
You're my only hope
So get her back to the day we met
'Cause that's as far as she needs to get
Oh, but please don't let her go
Oh, Laredo

(Woah, Laredo)
Don't let her go
(Woah, Laredo)
You're my only hope
(Woah, Laredo)
Woah, Laredo


Same streets, same party
Drowning their problems in Bacardi
Same people still talking
Whoa, I'm so over it, I'm sorry


Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds


You and me could
You and me could
We can leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could


If not, I get it
That smile on your face, yeah, it says different
One kiss, girl, just try it
'Cause you never know, you just might like it


Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds


You and me could
You and me could
We can leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could
Oh, baby, you and me could
Oh, baby, you and me could


Same streets, same party
Same people still talking


Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds


Like a blue bird with his heart removed, lonely as a train
I've run just as far as I can run
If I never see the good old days shining in the sun
I'll be doing fine and then some


How long, how long
Woman will you weep
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep


Well, I've been doing time in lonesome prison, where the sun doesn't shine
Just outside, the freedom river runs
Out there in that shiny night, with blood hounds on your mind
Don't you know it's the same sad situation?






Everybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody Ooh)
Everyone is out there on the loose
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name
But what you get is not quite what you choose




How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Muddy River runs so deep
How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Good night baby, rock yourself to sleep
Sleep tight baby, rock yourself to sleep
Bye bye baby, rock yourself to sleep


Doctor, you ain't got a pill
For whatever's making this world ill
You can't get forgiveness at the store
And peace, it's a politician's war


You won't find no resolution in the bottom of a bottle
In the stars or Aristotle, the only answer to the problem is


People loving people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people loving people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah


Words aren't what they seem to be
Talk is cheap but lies are free
We fear what we don't understand
We've been scared since time began


All the colors and the cultures circle 'round us on a spindle
It's a complicated riddle, the solution is so simple


It's people loving people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people loving people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah


You can pawn it off on kings and queens and those behind the curtain
Say one can't make a difference in a world so full of hurting
But I believe the remedy starts right here with you and me


People loving people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people loving people
It's just people loving people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
It's just people loving people


I was looking for a slow down
When you came around
I just didn't know how
I never left a bar room or a beer joint
Till the lights went out
But in the middle of a long slow kiss
The light came on
I been doing this all wrong
I think I'm a try holding on


And all my life I been running
And all these nights I've wasted
All this time I been on the move
I think I'ma stop now and
Bring it on home with you


This is where I use to make my move
Slip on my boots
Now I'm good staying here
Just laying here, tangled up in you
I just never found that one I couldn't resist
Ah I could get use to this
I think I'm going to need one more kiss




By my side not gonna let love pass me by
Whoa not this time.. come on




Gonna bring it on home
Gonna shake it all out
Just me and you in this big old house
Gonna have a time
Gonna find a place in the sun now baby
Gonna bring it on home
Gonna lay it on down
Gonna feel the way that I'm feelin' now forever baby
Yeah
Gonna bring it on home with you


Yo se bien que estoy afuera, pero el día que yo me muera
Se que tendrás que llorar, dirás que no me quisiste
Pero vas a estar muy triste, y así te vas a quedar


Con dinero y sin dinero, hago siempre lo que quiero
Y mi palabra es la ley, no tengo trono ni reyna
Ni nadie que me comprenca, pero sigo siendo el rey


Me enseñó que mi destino, era rodar y rodar
Despues me dijo un arriero
Que no hay que llegar primero
Pero hay que saber llegar




I know they say if you love somebody, you should set them free
But it sure is hard to do, it sure is hard to do
I know they say if you don't come back again, then it's meant to be (So they say)
Those words don't pull me through, 'cause I'm still in love with you


I spend each day here waitin' for a miracle
But it's just you and me goin' through the mill, climbin' up a hill


This is a long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breakin' a heart
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happenin' here is a long goodbye


Sometimes I ask my heart did we really, give our love a chance (Just one more chance)
But I know without a doubt, we turned it inside out
And if we walked away would it make more sense
But it tears me up inside, just to think we could still try


How long must we keep runnin' on a carousel
Goin' 'round and 'round and never gettin' anywhere, on a wing and prayer


This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breakin' a heart
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happenin' here is a long goodbye


Long goodbye
Long goodbye

Well, she's too complicated
To ever be described
Yeah, she's kinda like an angel
With a wild side

Free, she sets me free
If this is tied down, that's where I wanna be
She's my friend and my lover, that's my girl
I got the best of both worlds

Look at that body
Would you look at those eyes?
She'll be everything I dream of
When she loves me tonight

Free, she sets me free
If this is tied down, that's where I wanna be
She's my friend and my lover, that's my girl
I got the best of both worlds

She's always gonna be there when I have a bad day
She knows how to listen, knows just what to say
There's something 'bout her touch, it takes the world away
When she says nothing at all

Free, she sets me free
If this is tied down, that's where I wanna be
Ooh, she's my friend and my lover, that's my girl
I got the best of both worlds

I said that's my girl
I got the best of both worlds
I got the best of both worlds
I said that's my girl, alright

My heart is like a desert
Gone too long without rain
And your love is like the water
That makes the river run again
I'm burning like the Tucson sand
Broken as the partched, dry ground
I need to feel you
Raining down


I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
Well it feels like forever since
Last time I looked into your eyes
And I need to be reminded
And I need to be revived
So love me like a long lost friend
Caress me like the desert wind
And make a partched heart
Bloom again


I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
Rain
I need to feel you
In the Arizona rain
I wanna feel your love
In the Arizona rain


I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane (I wanna feel your love)
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain

Sometimes I think about the way it was
When we fell in love
Things were different then
Innocent and wide open
Free and beautiful
I want to feel like that again
But somewhere along the journey
I lost a part of me
And I know you can help me get it back
Yeah help me get it back

Chorus
Baby lay me down on our bed
Touch my body like only you can
Kiss me softly
Take away my breath
Slow it down and make it real
Cause tonight I want to feel
Like a woman

You?re the one who really gets me
Honey let me
Feel the fire in your hands

I know you can keep me burning
Feel the yearning
Cause you?re still my only man
Give me all that I can handle
Light a candle
Only you can bring me back to life
Oh I need you tonight

Chorus

Like a woman touched for the first time
Like a flower that blooms in the sunshine
I need to feel your love inside of me

Chorus

Yeah
Like a woman
Like a woman


Tommy's daddy, kept a six pack in the fridge
We thought we were old enough
To do what Daddy's did
It didn't take us long to go
From drunk to really sick
When I walked in my house
I stumbled just a bit


You play it cool
But it's no use
Dad aren’t no fool
And that's the truth
Chewing gum won't cover
Up that smell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try, you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well


We lost Daddy
In nineteen ninety-nine
I took care of everybody's pain
Except for mine
And then one night
My wife took my face in her hands
She said, "I think it's time you cry
For your old man"


You play it cool
But it's no use
She aren’t no fool
And that's the truth
And my teardrops finally fell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try, you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well


I could probably do more
To help my fellow man
But life gets busy
And I hope God understands
Someday, when I get time
I'll do more than my share
Funny how I'm thinking this
Sitting in my easy chair


You play it cool
But it's no use
God aren’t no fool
And that's the truth
And he won't let you fool yourself
You can't hide one single thought
If you try, you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well


When somebody knows you that well

She said howdy friend
As she was gigglin', my name is Caroline
But those who know me best call me
Tattoo rose
That got me wonderin'
Which pretty end, she had it inked in
Forbidden, well hidden underneath her clothes
And I asked
Where is your little secret
She said you know I keep it

Just a little south of my Mason-Dixon tan line
This yellow rose of Texas, that's right, has never seen the sunshine
Since that spring break down in Key West
Oh what a beautiful canvas
For a little tattoo rose

The way she moved it, and grooved it
To the music
Was smokin' up my mind and gettin' me high
I said I gotta know
Just how low, it really goes
Hey baby
Just maybe you could show me sometime
She said don't think so honey
Boy you should get so lucky

Just a little south of my Mason-Dixon tan line
This yellow rose of Texas, that's right, has never seen the sunshine
Since that spring break down in Key West
Oh what a beautiful canvas
For a little tattoo rose

Where is your little secret
She said you know I keep it

Just a little south of my Mason-Dixon tan line
This yellow rose of Texas, that's right, has never seen the sunshine
Since that spring break down in Key West
Oh what a beautiful canvas
For a little tattoo rose

I gotta see that tattoo
You know woman, I gotta see that tattoo


Darling I've been standing here just watching you all night
And I think I've even caught you watching me a couple times
If I don't ask I'll never know
This may sound dumb, but here we go
Do you believe in love at first sight


Me neither
I'm glad that we agree
Believe me
That's a big relief
Well, this place is awful crowded
And this music is so loud
Would you like to go and grab a bite to eat
Me neither


It's nice to finally meet a girl who doesn't move too fast
I was only checking, that's the reason that I asked
Relationships need time to grow
You and I should take this slow
And darling tell me, would you like to dance


Me neither
I was just being polite
Thank goodness
My feet are much too tired
I'm sure you're tired too
I can see an empty booth
Would you like to maybe sit and talk a while
Me neither
We'd never get along
I'm thinking there's no chemistry at all
This has been a waste of time
And I'm running outta lines
Don't you think it's time for me to end this song
Me neither


Teenage girl, much too young
Unprepared for what's to come


A baby changes everything


Not a ring
On her hand
All her dreams and all her plans




The man she loves she's never touched
How will she keep his trust




And she cries, oh she cries
She has to leave, go far away
Heaven knows she can't stay




She can feel it's coming soon
There's no place, there's no room




And she cries and she cries o she cries
Shepherds all... Gather around
Up above... A star shines down...
Choir of angels say
Glory to the newborn king




Everything, everything, every day
Hallelujah 


My whole life is turned around
I was lost but now i'm found



Well Momma was exhausted after she had me
It took two nurses to hold me, one nurse to slap me
Doctor turned to momma and shook his head
Whiped the sweat off his brow, and then he said 
"This boy is way off the charts, as far as I can tell
Ooo bpppp momma he's a double X L!"

By second grade I was 5' 2"!
By fifth grade I was wearing a size 12 shoe!
In eighth grade I was shopping at the, Big and Tall
And the coaches had me playing High School football
Uncle Roy said "Boy you'll make the NFL!
Ooo bbppp son, you're a double XL!"

Double XL, Double XL!
Dont call me on the phone just ring my dinner bell
Double XL Double XL!
Im a lean, mean, love machine that likes to be held
Ooo bbbppp baby Im a double XL!

Here we go!

Country cuties in Texas
String bikinis in Florida
Barbie Dolls driving Lexus, out in California
A skinny little pretty boy ain't what they wanna hold
They want a real man with meat on his bones!
I'll yank their Yankees, ring their Southern Belles
They say "ooo bbbppp we love a double XL!"

(Chorus)
Double XL solo!

Well double XL double XL
Dont call me on the phone just ring my dinner bell!
Double XL, double XL!
Im a lean mean love machine that likes to be held
Ooo bppp baby Im a double XL!
Well if you ahve any doubts
You can see for yourself
Why all the girls love a double XL
Ooo bppp yeah Im a double XL!

YEAAAH!

Oh boy!

Triple XL too!


I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keeping it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is


You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty


Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river


You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty


You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty


Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah


You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woo
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby
Oh yeah, woo, woo
No, you can't cry pretty, yeah


He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said "Daddy when you coming home"
He said the first thing that came to his mind


I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there


She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes


I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there


We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are


I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there
Oh I'm already
There


I can be strong like a burning whiskey
I can be sweet like Tennessee honey, honey
Pretty as a daisy, careful if you pick me
This wildflower can get a little crazy, baby


If you're runnin' around, you better run from me
Pack up your bags and get gone, get gone
You wreck my heart, I'll wreck everything
And anything I can get my hands on
If you lie, lie, lie with those wandering eyes
Better find one hell of a place to hide
If you mess with me, you best believe
That you're gonna be...asking for trouble


You got too many holes in your story
And I-I-I'll get down to the truth don't you worry, worry
Piece by piece I'll put it all together
And if you cross that line, you cross me forever, baby


If you're runnin' around, you better run from me
Pack up your bags and get gone, get gone
You wreck my heart, I'll wreck everything
And anything I can get my hands on
If you lie, lie, lie with those wandering eyes
Better find one hell of a place to hide
If you mess with me, you best believe
That you're gonna be...asking for trouble


Oooh oh oooh oh oh
Oooh oh oooh oh oh
Trouble
Oooh oh oooh oh oh
Oooh oh oooh oh oh


If you're runnin' around, you better run from me
Pack up your bags and get gone, get gone
If you wreck my heart, I'll wreck everything
And anything I can get my hands on
If you lie, lie, lie with those wandering eyes
Better find one hell of a place to hide
If you mess with me, you best believe
You best believe, yeah yeah
If you're foolin' around, you ain't foolin' me
Pack up your shit and get gone, get gone
You wreck my heart, wreck everything
And anything I can get my hands on
Lie-lie-lie look who's wandering eyes
Better find one hell of a place to hide
If you mess with me, you best believe
That you're gonna be asking for trouble


Oooh oh oooh oh oh
Oooh oh oooh oh oh


She grew up on the side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good, she grew up slow
Like American honey


Steady as a preacher, free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin', but wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey


There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey


Get caught in the race of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just want to go back in time
To American honey


There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey


Gone for so long now
I got to get back to her somehow
To American honey


There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey


And American honey


I wasn't born for digging deep holes
I'm not made for paving long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer


I'm not the type to work in a bank
I'm no good at slapping on paint
Don't have a knack for making motors crank, no
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer


So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the nightlife
I love my Bud Light
I like 'em cold and tall


I ain't much for mowing thick grass
I'm too slow for working too fast
I don't do windows so honey don't ask
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer


A go getter maybe I'm not
I'm not known for doing a lot
But I do my best work when the weather's hot
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer


So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the nightlife
I love my Bud Light
I like 'em cold and tall


I wasn't born for digging deep holes
I'm not made for paving long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer


 So hand me one more boys
That's what I'm here for


Well
You're a real hot cookie with your new hairdo
Your high heel boots and your credit card
Long legs and a mini skirt
Yeah, you know what works and you work it hard

You smile like such a lady
Innocent and sweet
You drive the men folk crazy
But any girl can see you're just a


Homewrecker
I know what you're doing
You think you're gonna ruin what I got
But you're not

Yeah, you little go getter
I'll teach you a lesson
If you get to messing with my man
You don't stand a chance
No, you're just a homewrecker


I'm sure you waited for a long, long time
To find a man like mine
But honey
You're too late

So before you go and make your move
Maybe me and you should get a few things straight
There's two ways we can do this
I'll let you decide
You can take it somewhere else
Or we can take it outside, you little


Homewrecker
I know what you're doing
You think you're gonna ruin what I got
But you're not

Yeah, you little go getter
I'll teach you a lesson
If you get to messing with my man
You don't stand a chance
No, you're just a homewrecker


Now, honey
I'm a Christian
But if you keep it up
I'm-a gonna go to kicking your pretty little butt
Is that clear enough?
Yeah, you little


Homewrecker
I'll teach you a lesson
If you get to messing with my man
You don't stand a chance
No, you're just a homewrecker

Yeah
You're just a homewrecker
A homewrecker

It took a while for me to see things as they were
In the light of truth
It wasn't you,it was me
I let myself get used to drowning in the hurt
Against the wall
Who'd of thought,it was me
From there I couldn't even look over my shoulder
I kicked down all the walls and started all over

And I don't paint myself into corners anymore
In a brittle heart of clay
I threw my brushes away
The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me
Are out the door
I don't paint myself into corners anymore

When you left you left me with no other choice at all
But to sink
To my knees,and cry
I never knew just how far a soul could fall
Like a rock
I couldn't stop,didn't try
I locked myself behind shades of misery
But when I let you go,I set myself free

And I don't paint myself into corners anymore
In a brittle heart of clay
I threw my brushes away
The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me
Are out the door
I don't paint myself into corners anymore

The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me
Are out the door
I don't paint myself into corners anymore

You’re gonna make
The finest mama some day
Some man will take you away
But until then

Chase down your dreams
Laugh all the time and believe
That love’s gonna conquer all things
So until then, I’ll be your man

(Chorus)
There was a time when
I thought I knew love
Until you came into this world
Time keeps on flying
But you’re always
Gonna be my baby girl

So as you walk
Through this life you will see
The world’s what you want it to be
But until then

Go on and dance
Dance like there’s no one around
Never stop singing out loud
And until then, I’ll be your man

(Chorus)

Go have a ball
Take every chance that you may
You know I’ll be one call away
I’ll always be, I’ll always be your man

Hold on child
Hold on tight to your old man
Hold on child
Hold on tight to your old man

I’m gonna hold you tight
Under my wing long as I can
Hold you tight
Under my wing long as I can

Hold on child
(Sweet child of mine)
Hold on tight to your old man
Hold on child
(Hold on tight)
Hold on tight to your old man

Hold you tight
(I’m gonna hold you tight)
Hold on tight to your old man
Hold you tight
(Hold on tight)
Under my wing long as I can

(Outro)


Looking back now, well it makes me laugh
We were growing our hair, we were cutting class
Knew it all already, there was nothing to learn
We were striking matches just to watch them burn
Listen to our music just a little too loud
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd
Heading to the rapids with some discount beer
It was a long train tussle but we had no fear


Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly
Young


Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the back seat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are some things that are never going to change


Man I don't know, where the time goes
But It sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young, Young, Yeah Wishing we were older
Young, Hey I wish it wasn't over


Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly
Young

Written by Buckie Moore and Wally Wilson

Well, it's Friday night at the Farmer's Daughter
But I'm the only one here drinkin' Bottled water
You left me to drown my broken heart
But this one, I'll get over, well, stone cold sober

'Cause I don't need "Jose", believe me, honey, I'm ok
"Jack Daniels" or "Jim Beam" ain't gonna pull me through
You wasted my time, my heart and my mind too:
I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you
Ha, ha

An' I'll admit, we've lived some on the wild side
We dug our heels in deep an' had a wild ride
Oh but one good shot of you was all I needed
So don't set 'em up, Joe, oh no, I'll stick to H2O

'Cause I don't need "Jose", believe me, honey, I'm ok
A "Jack Daniels" or a "Jim Beam" ain't gonna pull me through
An' you wasted my time, my heart and my mind too: (My time.)
I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you
Ah ha

Instrumental Break
(Oh, I think we need a little help from our friends.)

'Cause I don't need "Jose", believe me, honey, I'm ok
A "Jack Daniels" or a "Jim Beam" ain't gonna pull me through
An' you wasted my time, my heart and my mind too:
I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you
No I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you


When I feel my phone buzzing, ain't even gotta look down
I know it's you that's calling, a couple drinks in by now
So I say, "Hello," you say, "Hey, babe"
Say you're 'bout to catch a cab over to my place
"See you in five," but, baby, this time


Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown


Ain't gonna lie, if you knock on my door
I'm gonna let you walk in
Let you leave drunk lipstick marks like tattoos on my skin
But you know in the morning
We're gonna regret everything we did
So why even start what ain't good for our hearts


Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown


Keep sipping your drink, keep spinning the room
Keep chasing the night like you always do
Keep letting the good times play
Don't let me get in your way


Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown
Stay downtown
Yeah, this time around, baby, stay downtown


He drinks, he smokes
He’ll cuss, he swears, he tells bad jokes
And he ropes, and he rides
He lives life fast, and he loves to fight
He's a boozer, a loser
He calls me up when he's had too much
He's a schemer, a dreamer
Well, I tell him to change his ways
But he just turns to me and says
"I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter"
Whooooaahh!!


I ain't giving up on him just yet
‘Cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No, he won't quit, but you can bet
I'm stickin' to it
I (I) ain't (ain't)
No, I ain't no quitter


Well, he chews and he spits
Well, he flirts too much and he loves blonde chicks
And he struts, and he strolls
And he looks so cool, and yeah, he knows
He's a beauty, a cutie
His body rocks, and the girls, they flock
He's afflicted, addicted
Well, I tell him to change his ways
But he just turns to me and says
"I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter"
Whooooaahh!!




Ooh, his body rocks, and the girls, they flock
He's afflicted, addicted
Well, I tell him to change his ways
But he just turns to me and says
"I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter"
Whooooaahh!!


I ain't giving up on him just yet
‘Cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No, I ain't giving up on him just yet
Mmmm, ‘cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No, he won't quit, but you can bet
I'm stickin' to it
I (I) ain't (ain't)
Yeah, I ain't no quitter
Oh oh baby, I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter
Mmmm, yeah, I (I) ain't (ain't)
Yeah, I ain't no quitter


He's still driving that 1970 hand-me-down truck
And he's still wearing that red and black jersey
Waiting for the band to start up
He's still showing up twenty late
Finding hearts and rules to break
Why would he wanna change when
Every memory still bows to him?


But this ain't high school
Where all you care about is
If the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday, take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up
And the world gets cruel when you're still living in high school


He's still calling that first love, first time, pretty-eyed blonde
And she's still letting it ring 'cause his ring isn't what she wants
'Cause she traded in prom queen for a big city dream
And a slate that's clean, but
Your heart just don't get it and that's why you can't forget it
'Cause you're living like you're seventeen


But this ain't high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday, take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up and the world gets cruel when


You're still living in the hallways
Where everybody stopped and stared
And cared and knew your name
'Cause this is the real world that don't know you like that
You can remember but you can't go back


To high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday and  take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up
And the world gets cruel when you're still living in high school


When you're still living in
Five years later
Oh yeah (Oh yeah, yeah), oh yeah (Oh yeah, yeah)

He's still calling that first love, first time
And he hates that he said goodbye, she went on with her life
He's still driving the same old back roads
Wondering when he got so old
Where did his life go?
Oh, but he knows
Oh, he knows
Yeah, he knows
That this ain't high school, oh, woah
And he's still driving that 1970 hand-me-down truck
And he's stuck in high school
But this ain't high school


We've been doing this war dance together
For sometime I know
And treating love like a battlefield
And taking it slow
Will you blink
What do you think
The union we propose is dangerous, I know


Love is a game until it's played
And if it's lost it can't ever be saved
We have heaven to gain and hell to lose
But the difference is up to me and you
So if you will, I will stop saying I won't
And start saying I do


But life can take a long time
If you make the wrong choice
Time sure seems to fly by
When I hear your voice
Mistakes are hard
I hope we find
The courage to believe
We will succeed


'Cause love is a game until it's played
And if it's lost, it can't ever be saved
We have heaven to gain and hell to lose
And the difference is up to me and you
So if you will, I will stop saying I won't
And start saying I do


Well our hearts are locked inside an iron box
We're both too afraid to reveal our most tender parts, oh


Because love is a game until it's played
And if you lose, you can't ever be saved
We have heaven to gain but hell to lose
The difference is up to me and you
So if you will, I will stop saying I won't
Stop saying I can't
Cause if you do, I do


You say you never danced to a dashboard singin' R.E.M. under summer stars
Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark
You don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same
Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change


When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?


Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you


When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, baby, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?


Now the way you're looking says you're living
I hope I ain't reading wrong
Cause the way you're shining I think you're thinking
It's been way too long


When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah yeah, let yourself go, come on follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive, alive
When was the last time oh you did something for the first time, girl?
Come on, baby
When was the last time yeah you did something for the first time?


I still believe in fairy tales
I still believe in picking flowers
I still believe in getting lost in someone’s eyes
And talking for hours
I still believe in shooting stars
I still believe in midnight drives
And butterflies you get
Right before you kiss for the very first time


Love, how many times can a heart break?
Love, how much weight can a soul take?
Love, I don’t know where you ran off to
But love, love, love, I still believe in you


I still believe in miracles
I still believe in wedding rings and bibles
I still believe the best walk you’ll ever take
Is walking down the aisle




I still believe that you’ll come knocking on my door
When I least expect you to
You give me something I can hold
You pull me through, cause that’s what you do
That’s what you do love
Yeah, that’s what you do love




I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot


I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half
As bad as it looks
I believe most people are good


I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose


I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good


I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last


I believe most people are good
And most Mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good


I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good

Snowy days and frosty nights
Everything looks cold and white
Hangin' round the mistletoe
Hangin' round the mistletoe

Christmas Day will soon be here
And everybody's full of cheer
Hangin' round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear

Well, I've waited all year long
Now the year is almost gone
Hangin' round the mistletoe
Hangin' round the mistletoe

But if that's what I got to do
Just to get a kiss from you
I'm hangin' round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear

Christmas is a special time
To give and to receive
For every little kiss you give me
I will give you three

You ain't gonna miss one kiss
That's one thing you'll never miss
I'm hangin' round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear

I've had my eyes on you
For a long, long time
So I'm asking Santa please
Make that pretty girl mine

I've waited till I'm cold and blue
Just to get a kiss from you
Hangin' round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear

Hangin' round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear

Glory to the newborn king

I've been goin' out every night havin' a ball
Comin' home about a quarter to two
Oh you said that you'd be leavin'
If you didn't start seein'
A change in me really soon
You said it's gettin' really old
And that you wanna be told
That I ain't a drinkin' no more
Well now honey here it goes
Better listen close
Before you go walkin' out the door

I ain't a drinkin' anymore
Oh now that's what you want me to say
I ain't a drinkin anymore
Guess you finally got your way
Nope I ain't a drinkin' not a one beer
That's what you wanna hear
But honey I must confess
I ain't a drinkin' anymore
But I ain't drinkin' any less

I got lit the other night
Yeah I got in a fight
The police had me down on the ground
They were puttin' on the cuffs
They really roughed me up
They said boy "we're takin' you down"
Before he read my rights
He said take my advice
"Don't let me catch you drinkin' no more"
I said officer please let me go
And I won't do it anymore
Come on let me go on home

I ain't a drinkin' anymore
Oh now that's what you want me to say
I ain't a drinkin anymore
Guess you finally got your way
Nope I ain't a drinkin' not a one beer
That's what you wanna hear
But honey I must confess
I ain't a drinkin' anymore
But I ain't drinkin' any less

Don't ride your bike off a ramp that's more than three bricks high
Don't take that candy from the store if you ain't got the dime
Don't pick a fight with a little guy that doesn't talk that much
Don't pick up a cherrybomb thinkin' it's a dud
And don't sneak out of a 2 story house usin' bed sheets for a rope
Don't ask me how I know

(Chorus:)
Sell your truck while it's still runnin', save the Jesus off the dash
Say a prayer when you feel like cussin', save your money pay with cash
Forget your pride, buy the roses, if you're sorry tell her so
Don't drink the water in Mexico
Don't ask me how I know

Don't quit your high school football team halfway through the season
Don't bust your buddy in the nose when you know he didn't mean it
Don't lose a girl you love at home for a night in Panama City
Don't rush off the phone when your Mama calls you ain't that busy
Ya oughta make that drive to say goodbye to your grampa â€˜fore he goes
Don't ask me how I know

(Chorus)
Forget your pride buy the roses, if you love her tell her so
Don't go to Vegas with your heart broke
Don't bum your cousin for that first smoke
I'm tellin' ya, don't drink the water in Mexico
Don't ask me how I know
Don't ask me how I know
I just know
Sell your truck while it's still runnin', say a prayer when you feel like cussin'
I know


I'm gonna be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I want to sleep with you forever
And I want to die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm


And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us


I wanna honor your mother
I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better than it's ever been


And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us


We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Coming your way


I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits, but it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you with a warm, wet kiss
Yes, I am


And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us
And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us, oh baby


They're gonna say I fell too fast
They're gonna say it's never gonna last and
Before it's too late, I should just back away
Yeah, they're gonna say that
He ain't the kind to hold my hand
He ain't gonna try to understand
Nothing under the surface
He's just looking for a pretty face


But they got it all wrong
I got it all right
They say they just don't see it
But I saw it at first sight


And I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even faze me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, mmm


So, I could care less if I'm being careless
Might wreck me to be reckless
But I'd rather fall apart than love half-hearted
Yeah, maybe it's true that you know when you know
And then again, maybe you don't
But when you find a diamond, you can't keep it from shining


And I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even faze me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, mmm


The life of my party
He keeps my eyes starry
So, I'm so sorry for not being sorry
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, yeah


I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even faze me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, mmm


They're gonna say I fell too fast
Yeah, they're gonna say it's never gonna last
Unapologetically


There's a plane flying out of here tonight
Destination New Orleans
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line
He says that's right where I need to be
Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home
All this leaving her alone is killing me
And holding her right now has got me thinkin' more and more
This is right where I need to be


Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to be


There's a plane flying out of here tonight
With an empty first class seat
Because I've finally got all my priorities in line
And I'm right where I need to be


Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to be

It was Indiana, a summer day
And I was three years old
My momma said go out to play
Well, I did what I was told

She never saw it comin'
When I turned the sprinkler on
She looked up from the dishes
And right there in the front lawn

Nothing but cowboy boots
Sets your spirit free
That wild, wild western birthday suit
Is the remedy for modesty
It ain't proper, it ain't cool
But folks remember what you do
In nothing, whoa, nothing but cowboy boots

Well, all it takes when you're eighteen
Is your buddy's double dare
It was eight o'clock on a Friday night
In the middle of Town Square

Couldn't hear the sirens
'Cause so many people cheered
When the sheriff showed up
I was grinnin' ear to ear

In nothin' but cowboy boots
Sets your spirit free
That wild, wild western birthday suit
Is the remedy for modesty
It ain't proper, it ain't cool
But folks remember what you do
In nothing, whoa, nothing but cowboy boots

I came home late tonight
You just smiled at my surprise
I see ya comin' down the hall
Whoa, in nothing, whoa

Nothing but cowboy boots
Sets your spirit free
That wild, wild western birthday suit
Is the remedy for modesty
It ain't proper, it ain't cool
But folks remember what you do
In nothing, whoa, nothing, no, no
Nothing but those cowboy boots

Oh no, no, nothin', no
Nothing but those cowboy boots


Life goes on, life goes on
Life goes on, life goes on


You sucked me in and played my mind
Just like a toy, you were cranked and wind

Baby, I would give till you wore it out
You left me lying in a pool of doubt
And you're still thinkin' you're the Daddy Mac
You should've known better
But you didn't
And I can't go back


Oh, life goes on
And it's only gonna make me strong
It's a fact
Once you get on board
Say good-bye 'cause you can't go back
Oh, it's a fight
And I really wanna get it right
Where I'm at
Is my life before me
And this feelin' that I can go back
Life goes on
Life goes on


Wish I knew then what I know now
You held all the cards and sold me out
Baby, shame on you if you fool me once
Shame on me if you fool me twice
You've been a pretty hard case to crack
Should've known better, but I didn't
And I can't go back


Oh, life goes on
And it's only gonna make me strong
It's a fact
Once you get on board
Say good-bye 'cause you can't go back
Oh, it's a fight
And I really wanna get it right
Where I'm at
Is my life before me
And this feelin' that I can go back
Life goes on
Life goes on


Na, na, na, na, na
Life goes on
Na, na, na, na
It made me strong
Oh yeah, got this feeling
That I can't go back
Life goes on, life goes on
And it's only gonna me strong
Life goes on, life goes on
And on and on


Shame on you if you fool me once
Shame on me if you fool me twice
You've been a pretty hard case to crack
Should've known better
But I didn't
And I can't go back


Na, na, na, na, na
Life goes on
Na, na, na, na
It made me strong
Oh, yeah
Gotta feeling that I can't go back
No, I can't go back
Oh yeah


I've gotta go now
I'm moving on
No turning back
'Cause you made me strong


He pulled up in his red Corvette
Salmon shorts and a white V-neck
I said "wow, you know how
To dress down for a city guy"


We headed out to a spot on the lake
Couple zip poles and a cup full of bait
I could tell pretty fast
He had more than just bass on his mind


Oh, I was fishing, he was wishing we were kissing
I was getting madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Getting closer, sliding over
Crowding up my casting shoulder
Reaching out to try to hold my reeling hand
Saying I'm pretty, saying he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, yeah it could
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish
Shut up and fish


For a little while he calmed down and let up
But when he went right back to pushing his luck
And that line of mine wasn't all I wanted to throw in
Oh no


Oh, I was fishing, he was wishing we were kissing
I was getting madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Getting closer, sliding over
Crowding up my casting shoulder
Reaching out to try to hold my reeling hand
Saying I'm pretty, saying he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, yeah it could
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish
Shut up and fish


I finally had all of him that I could take
So I gave him a cold shower in the lake
What can I say?


I was fishing, he was wishing we were kissing
I was getting madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Getting closer, sliding over
 cast him over
Reaching out to try to hold my reeling hand
Saying I'm pretty, saying he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, yeah it could
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish


Just a little push
'Cause he couldn't just
Shut up and fish
Shut up and fish

On a hill far away stood an Old Rugged Cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

So I'll cherish the Old Rugged Cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the Old Rugged Cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach, gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share

And I'll cherish the Old Rugged Cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

Yeah, I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross
And exchange it some day for a crown


I'm gonna get my drink on, I wanna hear me a sad song
My baby just left home, I didn't treat her right
Right here's where I belong, I'm gonna stay 'till the money's gone
If it takes me all night long, I'm gonna get my drink on


Well I got some little problems and the only way to solve 'em is the sure-fire way I know
And when the going gets tough, well the tough get going to the little bar down the road





There's a cold bar stool for a hot-headed fool, and I'm gonna hop right to it
Or a seat a table with a jug of black label when a 12-pack won't quite do




Well Jo the bartender, she's a mighty good friender and she likes my company
When she says "last call for alcohol" that won't apply much to me





If it takes me all night long I'm gonna get my drink on
Drink on, Yeah
I'm gonna get my drink on

I know a girl she was a waitress
Had a big spirit till she let her boyfriend break it
He always talked her down
Took her pride and kicked it around
Took it as long as she could take it
She left a note on the dresser and hung up her apron
Cry cry till the sun shines baby
Cry cry till the sun shines
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright baby
Ooh
I know a man who tried to ease his mind
Chased his regrets with any bottle he could find
Life cut him down so low
Took his pride and broke his soul
Till he forgave himself and let it go
Cry cry till the sun shines baby
Cry cry till the sun shines
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright baby
Ooh ooh
We're all here just trying to live our lives
Pay our electric bills and spending up our time
There ain't a friend to be found
Who can't break through the concrete clouds
When the rain when the rain comes crashing down
Ooh yeah
Cry cry till the sun shines baby
Cry cry till the sun shines
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright oh yeah
Cry cry till the sun shines baby
Cry cry till the sun shines
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright baby


Where are you Christmas
Why can't I find you
Why have you gone away
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me
Why can't I hear music play
My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too

Where are you Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go
Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh
If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time

I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away
The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart with love


Where are you Christmas
Fill your heart with love


I've been here before
It only made me cry
I felt so sure
I never questioned why
Till I woke up alone
That's why I have to ask you
Baby what's behind your kiss
I need to know your heart's in this


I'm waiting for the kind of love
That is strong enough
To walk through anything
So don't waste my time
So don't waste my time
I only  want to play for keeps
Want to fall in deep
If you don't just say goodbye
Don't waste my time


The words you say
Are what I want to hear
Promises you make
Are music to my ears
Is it the heat of the moment talking
Promises come easily
Give me something to believe




Time, time, time, time





Don't waste my time


I feel terrible, sunlight's hurting my eyes
So I pull the shades and I make my place as black as night
I feel miserable, and I'm missing you and me
'Nother Sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets


No I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you
All messed up, all strung out
I was sitting at home, breaking down
Not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night


Besides the pain, I don't feel a thing
When my buddies call me up, I just let it ring


No I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you
All messed up, all strung out
I was sitting at home, breaking down
Not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night


No I'm not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night


Here's to findin' a good man
Got a bucket of Corona
Enough stories to
Last all night

About the trials
And tribulations
Of findin' Mr. Right
Of findin' a good man


Here's to the liars
And the cheaters
And the cold mistreaters
To the mama's boys who can't make a stand

Here's to the superficial players
The I love you too soon sayers
If you hear me girls
Raise your hand
Let's have a toast
Here's to findin' a good man


Blind dates
And horror stories
Pushy guys
And fast movers

Let's dedicate this girl's night out
To big talkers
Bad losers
It's so hard findin' a good man




Julie
I know you want perfection
Angie
You want a listener
Lisa
Your list is gettin' long
And girls
You know me
I just want a good kisser



I met a little girl
And she liked me
She kissed me soft
And I gave her my ring
Love was new and things were lookin' up
So I put her name on the front of my truck
In a perfect world
In a perfect world

Chorus
In a perfect world
When boy meets girl
They spin and dance
Like a tilt-a-whirl
Top of the ferris wheel
A cotten candy kiss
Yeah, a perfect world feels just like this
Hey It's a perfect world with me and you
Hey it's a perfect world ah ooh
Ain't nothing better than when you take my hand
It's never never land
Oh Oh Oh it's a perfect world

We went to the sonic and we rode around town
With the radio up and the windows down
When she held my hand it felt so real
We ended up parkin' on lovers hill
In a perfect world
In a perfect world

Repeat Chorus
In a perfect world
When boy meets girl
They spin and dance
Like a tilt-a-whirl
Top of the ferris wheel
A cotten candy kiss
Yeah, a perfect world feels just like this
Hey It's a perfect world with me and you
Hey it's a perfect world ah ooh
Ain't nothing better than when you take my hand
It's never never land
Oh Oh Oh it's a perfect world

Hey It's a perfect world with me and you
Hey it's a perfect world ah ooh
Ain't nothing better than when you take my hand
It's never never land
Oh Oh Oh it's a perfect
Oh Oh Oh it's a perfect
Oh Oh Oh it's a perfect world


Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on getting high
High above the lights of town


Because you and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough


Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
There were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again


You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough


When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins
That do you in


You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough


Never enough
You and tequila
You and tequila (make me crazy)


Who died and crowned me everybody's everything
I'm even busting my butt through the weekend
By the time I get home there's not an ounce of sanity
Between the dogs, my momma's calls
Is it against the law
For me to get what I need


A good friend and a glass of wine
Someone to say it's gonna be alright
A good friend and a glass of wine
A little pick me up to get me through the night
We talk trash n' we laugh and cry
That kind of therapy money can't buy
Every now and then, every now and then
Every girl needs a good friend and a glass of wine


I don't need to jet off to no vacation for a week
I'd be happy to have a happy hour
When I'm tired and I'm fried it gets me right back on my feet
Any kind of red or white, a little sister time
It's every smart girls secret


A good friend and a glass of wine
Someone to say it's gonna be alright
A good friend and a glass of wine
A little pick me up to get me through the night
We talk trash n' we laugh and cry
That kind of therapy money can't buy
Every now and then, every now and then
Every girl needs a good friend and a glass of wine

Sometimes I feel just like a fly in a soup bowl
Sometimes I feel like I'm on top of the heap
Sometimes I feel like I'm the king of the castle
Sometimes I feel like just a bump on the street
I got my highs and lows
Some days it's touch and go
But baby, this I know

CHORUS:
When you're with me
I feel like singing
It's like I'm swinging the whole planet on the end of my chain
Oh, when you kiss me
My head starts spinnin'
It's like you're sending the adrenaline
Straight to my brain
And it feels right as rain
All my worries wash away
When you're with me

You are a lazy summer day on a porch swing
You are a night running wild on the town
My red Ferrari racing me down a back street
My pick-me-up when I'm a little bit down
No matter where I go, whatever dice I roll
Baby, this I know

Chorus

I got my highs and lows
No matter where I go
Baby, this I know

Chorus

When you're with me
I feel like singing
My head starts spinning
Feels right as rain


Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known


That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around


Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know


That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around


And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry


'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now


Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now


Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know


Hold up my right hand
Swear to the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask from you
Is to treat me the same way, too
'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have


Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know


First, you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that it's in your hands
Want you to understand
I would have given it to you anyway


Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

She's unusually unusual!

She introduced herself as Amy, said call me Caroline for short
She said, I just moved in three doors down
So I wouldn't be the girl next door
And I knew the shoes she wasn't wearing fit her just right
And she said "Hey, man did you know that somebody
Left your grass out in the yard all last night?"

Chorus
She's unusually unusual
Absolutely unpredictable, yes she is
She's so different and that's what's wonderful, oh yeah
She's unusually unusual
And that's beautiful to me

She had a tattoo above her ankle of a trident submarine
She said it symbolizes awesome powers hidden deep within our dreams
And her diamond eyes, different in color, held me captive in their light
And she said "Hey, man did you know we used to be brothers
Yeah in some past life?"

Chorus
She's unusually unusual
Absolutely unpredictable, yes she is
She's so different and that's what's wonderful, oh yeah
She's unusually unusual
And that's beautiful to me

Some people may thinks she's strange
A different cup of tea
But she just does it for me

Chorus
She's unusually unusual
Absolutely unpredictable, yes she is
She's so different, and that's what's wonderful, oh yeah
She's unusually unusual
And that's beautiful to me

Oh, thats good enough for me
Yes she is
She unusually unusual
And thats beautiful to me

Yeah Unsusall!

(Walt Aldridge/Brad Crisler)

You say you wanna be in love
But you're just not sure enough
To let your heart get in too deep
You wanna play it smart with me
Not fall too recklessly
Kinda look before you leap
Well I, I think I'll pass this time
'Cause I got somethin' else in mind

When you're ready for the deep end
When you wanna walk the high wire, baby
When you're ready to take a chance
On findin' something real
When you're lookin' for a gambler
A little bit of adventure in your world
Well, I wanna be that girl

I know it's hard to bet
On somethin' you ain't seen yet
When it could be pleasure, it could be pain
I'm lookin' for the kind of heart
To risk it all from the very start
'Cause nothing ventured, nothing yet
And I've had it with half-hearted tries
This time I'm not gonna compromise

When you're ready for the deep end
When you wanna walk the high wire, baby
When you're ready to take a chance
On findin' something real
When you're lookin' for a gambler
A little bit of adventure in your world
Well, I wanna be that girl

When you're ready for the deep end
When you wanna walk the high wire, baby
When you're ready to take a chance
On findin' something real
When you're lookin' for a gambler
A little bit of adventure in your world
Well, I wanna be that girl

(When you're ready for the deep end
When you wanna walk the high wire, baby)
When you're ready to take a chance
I wanna be that girl
I wanna be that girl


You're the flops on my feet
The top down on my jeep
You're the watermelon, sticky-lip
Kiss on my cheek
You're the kick in the cup
Pretty girl, you know what's up
You a skinny little dip in the creek

You're the shades that hide the rays
You're even sweeter than my sweet nanny's lemonade
Yeah you're hotter than a tiki
Midnight sneaky
Out my back window, girl
You coming out to meet me, yeah


Turn it up girl, You're turning me on
I wanna spin you like a record
Here forever long
You know I'm digging what you're doing
Grooving just like you're grooving
Hit that playback
Let's get back to it now

You and me we're like a simple song
Yeah so damn easy to sing along
I don't need a guitar or a band
Cause baby you're my Summer Jam


You're the sun on my face
The cold beer in the case
You're the little tan legs swinging off of my gate
You're the moon in my shine
You're the rap in my rhyme
You ain't a 7, 8, 9
No, girl you're a dime

You're the shades that hide the rays
You're even cooler than my cooler
When I'm chilling on the lake
Yeah you finer than fine
You put the good in the time
You're the fireworks flying on the fourth of July
So come on


Turn it up girl, You're turning me on
I wanna spin you like a record
Here forever long
You know I'm digging what you're doing
Grooving just like you're grooving
Hit that playback
Let's get back to it now
You and me we're like a simple song
Yeah so damn easy to sing along
I don't need a guitar or a band
Cause baby you're my Summer Jam


Don't need no "Sweet Home Alabama"
I don't want a Jukebox, baby
I don't need a beat to dance
All I need is you and me
You know that baby
You're my little shottie hottie driving me crazy
You're the melody that gets me poppin'
There ain't no stoppin' when we get to rockin'
C'mon


Turn it up girl, you're turning me on
I wanna spin you like a record
Here forever long
You know I'm digging what you're doing
Grooving just like you're grooving
Hit that playback
Let's get back to it now
You and me we're like a simple song
Yeah so damn easy to sing along
I don't need a guitar or a band
Cause baby you're my Summer Jam


All I need is you and me
You know that baby
You're the melody that drives me crazy
I don't need a guitar or a band
(Aw yeah)
Cause baby you're my Summer Jam


I’m so confused
I know I heard You loud and clear
So, I followed through
Somehow I ended up here
I don’t wanna think
I may never understand
That my broken heart is a part of Your plan
When I try to pray
All I’ve got is hurt and these four words


Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done


I know You’re good
But this don’t feel good right now
And I know You think
Of things I could never think about
It’s hard to count it all joy
Distracted by the noise
Just trying to make sense
Of all Your promises
Sometimes I gotta stop
Remember that You’re God
And I am not
So


Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will


I know You see me
I know You hear me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
I know You hear me
I know You see me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
So


Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done


I know You see me
I know You hear me, Lord


Pour me, pour me
Pour me, pour me another shot of whiskey
Bartender hit me one more time
He left, I cried
I'm lost inside, won't ya help me
Fill it to the top cause I hit rock bottom this time


Well I don't want to listen to the old jukebox
So don'tcha put no quarters in the slot
I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna dance
I dang sure ain't lookin' for romance


I don't wanna hang out with the crowd
I don't wanna party and get real loud
Believe me when I tell ya that I've thought this through
There's only one thing that I want you to do




Here's my story, it's sad but it's true
There's so many things that I never knew
He loved to party and he loved to dance
He loved to get loud every time he had the chance


I always thought he was a simple-minded Okie
Little did I know he was the king of karaoke
He was everything that a man should be
Problem was that it wasn't with me




Fill it to the top cause I hit rock bottom this time
Fill it to the top cause I hit rock bottom this time

Pour Me
Pour Me
Pour Me
Pour Me

Today I wanted to write a tune
Started strummin' this little groove
I could've wrote about love or money something sad or something funny

But hey, hey, hey whats so wrong with one more drinkin' song
Hold up your cups and sing along to one more drinkin' song

And if by chance this brings you cheer maybe someday you'll bring me a beer
Or not to mention my favorite drink a marga-daiquiri-screw-aloda-on the beach

Hey, hey, hey whats so wrong with one more drinkin' song
Hold up your cups and sing along to one more drinkin' song

So here's to cheap whiskey and fine wine
Buyin' shots and pick up lines
And here's to bartenders tryin' to get paid when all of us are tryin' to get ---_

Hey, hey, hey whats so wrong with one more drinkin' song
Hold up your cups and sing along to one more drinkin' song
Hey, hey, hey whats so wrong with one more drinkin' song
Hold up your cups and sing along to one more drinkin' song
Hey, hey, hey whats so wrong with one more drinkin' song
Hold up your cups and sing along to one more drinkin' song


I know i gotta put in the hours
Make the money while the sunlight shines
But anything i gotta get done
It can get done some other time


Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer
But i got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
She's where i need to be
Time is love, gotta run


I only get so many minutes
Don't wanna spend 'em all on the clock
In the time that we spent talking
How many kisses have i lost?


Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer
But i got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
She's where i need to be
Time is love, gotta run


Gotta fly
Fly
Before one more moment
Gets by...


Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer
But i got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
She's where i need to be


Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer
But i got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
She's where i need to be
Time is love, gotta run
Time is love, gotta run...

Sorry I'm so late, but I've been out walking
Trying to find a way to tell you
What I think you already know
I'd never want to hurt you 'cause darling I still love you
But things aren't like they used to be
It's time for letting go

I wasn't out there looking, but a month ago last Sunday
I met someone just like you in line at the grocery store
And we've been spending time together
Yeah, she knows all about you
The truth is she can give me
What you can't anymore

Lookin' back when we first started
I never thought I'd see this day
If only I could write the pages
Our story wouldn't end this way

I feel so much beter knowing we could have this moment
But it looks like it may rain soon and it's getting kinda late
I'll always bring your roses each time I come to visit
The caretaker's waving, he wants to close the gates

Lookin' back when we first started
I never thought I'd see this day
If only I could write the pages
Our story wouldn't end this way

If only I could write the pages
Our story wouldn't end this way

I come here today, I'm kind of nervous
You know how words get in my way
It should come easy, I've been rehearsing
I don't know why I'm so afraid, to say
Will you marry me
Put our love and life together
Will you stay with me
For always and forever
On bended knee, would you take this ring
Will you marry me, please
Will you marry me
To be with you is what I live for
But at this moment I confess
Though I love you, God knows I love you
Deep down inside I'm scared to death, say yes
Will you marry me
Put our love and life together
Will you stay with me
For always and forever
On bended knee, would you take this ring
Will you marry me, please
Will you marry me
On bended knee
On bended knee
Would you take this ring
I will take your ring
Will you marry me, please
Will you marry me


Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down


On a bed sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out
There ain't nothing that love can't fix
Girl, it's right here at our fingertips




Come a little closer, baby
I feel like letting go
Of everything that stands between us
And the love we used to know
I wanna touch you like a cleansing rain
Let it wash all the hurt away




If there's still a chance
Then take my hand
And we'll steal away
Off into the night
'till we make things right
The suns gonna rise on a better day

Come a little closer baby
I feel like stripping it down
Back to the basics of you and me
And what makes the world go round
Every inch of you against my skin
I wanna be stronger than we've ever been




Come a little bit closer baby
Just a little bit closer baby
Come a little bit closer baby
I feel like laying you down


My grandmother owned a nightclub on the Arkansas-Oklahoma line
Momma put me on a greyhound, and I went
To stay with her in the summertime
I'd box up those empty long necks and stack'em in the back and make
A hand
Then at night she'd let me sneak out of the kitchen and sit in with the band
Yes, I have sacked some quarterbacks and broke my share of bones along the way
I knew it wouldn't
Last forever, semi-pro always means semi-paid
I started climbing' drilling' rig, I'm oil field trash and
Proud as I can be
Then I took my songs and guitar and sang'em to a man from Tennessee


I've played every beer joint tavern from New York city out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out every basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city
Too
I am a red, white and blue blood graduate of honkytonk U


A star can't burn forever, and the brightest ones will someday lose their shine
But the glass won't
Ever be half empty in my optimistic mind
I'll still have a song to sing and a band to turn it up and
Play it loud
As long as there's a bar room with a corner stage and a honkytonk crowd


I've played every beer joint tavern from New York city out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out ever basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city
Too
Son I'm a red, white, and blue blood graduate of honkytonk U
That's right a red, white, and blue
Blood graduate of honkytonk U


We scratched our names
In that oak tree
'Cause I loved you
And you loved me
A jagged little heart, so the whole town knew it
Carved in the bark with an arrow through it
I came out here to see it one more time


And I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know it's got to go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw


Well, I guess all those years
They don't mean nothing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters
A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter
Because I, I don't have you


But I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know it's got to go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
Woah, oh
Yeah
Just a little ol' chainsaw


I remember what you said that night
That you would love me for the rest of your life
We wrote "forever" with a pocketknife
But forever's going down tonight


'Cause I got my chainsaw
Oh it's got to go, it's such a shame doll
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sitting on a stump
Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holding a chainsaw
Chain, chain, chainsaw
Woo!


Da, da, da, da, da, da, da (chain, chain, chainsaw)
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da


When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky fall to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losin' hope
But somehow, baby
You broke through and saved me


You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in


You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you


You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killin' my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singin', babe, hallelujah
We'll be touchin'
We'll be touchin' heaven


You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in


You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you


I don't need the stars 'cause you shine for me
Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy
You're my ecstasy


You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you


You're the healin' hands where it used to hurt
You're my savin' grace, you're my kind of church
You're holy


I walked in, there sat Slim
Cleaning up his memory with some sapphire gin
Mr. Pain grabbed my arm and pulled me aside
And said kid are you ready for the wild ride


I looked up, there she stood
I say, didn't look so great, I say you look good
Aw she took her hand ran it up my thigh
And said, cowboy you ready for the wild ride


Come on now junior take a wild ride (wild ride)
See can you make it on the wild ride (wild ride)
Don't try no shaking on the wild ride (wild ride)
Things start breaking on the wild ride (wild ride)
Yes it does


Out on the highway, I saw my mind
In tiny little pieces blown from side to side
My heart was shattered along with my pride
Guess you can't keep them on the wild ride


Come on now junior take a wild ride (wild ride)
See can you make it on the wild ride (wild ride)
Don't try no shaking on the wild ride (wild ride)
Things start breaking on the wild ride (wild ride)
Yes it does


I was crawling across the floor, I was trying to leave
When I felt something tugging what was left of my sleeve
I heard a little voice with a gold plated vibe
Say I bought a ticket for the wild ride


Come on now junior take a wild ride (wild ride)
See can you make it on the wild ride (wild ride)
Don't try no shaking on the wild ride (wild ride)
We just might break it on the wild ride (wild ride)

Come on now junior take a wild ride (wild ride)
See can you make it on the wild ride (wild ride)
Don't try no shaking on the wild ride (wild ride)
We just might break it on the wild ride (wild ride)

I remember when baseball was everything
It was Little League, but what a big game
There were two men on and one man out
I got a fastball hangin' outside
I swung that bat with all my might
And the ball was gone
They say I knocked the cover off
It was the only homer that I ever had
You shoulda seen my dad

And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me
As long as I'm holdin' on
Heaven wouldn't ask it of me
The devil on a good day ain't that strong
I'm keepin' it here inside me
As long as I live and breathe
The ball was soarin' and the crowd was roarin'
And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me

I was nineteen, it was a good job
Movin' TVs on a loading dock
'Til the boss said, "Son
Try to lose every seventh one
I got it worked out with a good friend
Keep your mouth shut, and we'll cut you in
Now what do you say
Don't you want to be rich one day"
I lost a real good job that night
But I kept my pride

And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me
As long as I'm holdin' on
Heaven wouldn't ask it of me
The devil on a good day ain't that strong
I'm keepin' it here inside me
As long as I live and breathe
I said goodbye with my head held high
And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me

And sometimes it feels like
My best years are behind me
Then somehow, out of nowhere
Something sneaks up to remind me
Like this mornin', I woke up
To a little voice that spoke up
Sayin', "Daddy, please
Fix a bowl of Rice Krispies
You're the bestest friend that I ever had
You know I love you Dad"

And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me
As long as I'm holdin' on
Heaven wouldn't ask it of me
The devil on a good day ain't that strong
I'm keepin' it here inside me
As long as I live and breathe
I got more than I ever asked for
And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me


Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air


What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh


Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

I heard the door slam
And I couldn't tell was it just the wind
Or was she mad again - ah hell
She's gettin in her car
I hollered baby is there something wrong
Thought I heard her say something sounded like I'm gone
But these days gone can mean so many things

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Well its gettin dark out, she ain't back yet
Ain't called home, turned off the phone
Ah man hah this might not be good
I would have stopped her, when she went to leave
But I didn't 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin now
I'm still not sure what gone is all about

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Is it the kind of gone where she's at her mom's cooling down
She'll come around or the kind that says you had your chance
And she ain't comin back

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout
What kinda gone are we talkin bout
Yes what kinda gone are we talkin bout here
What kinda gone

Granddaddy was Irish Cherokee
Ran moonshine from here to Tennessee
Spent half his life in the Montgomery county jail

Grandma she got drunk and left
All her kids on her mamas front steps
Nobody's heard from her since she hightailed

I come from a long line of losers
Half outlaw half boozers
I was born with a shot glass in my hand
I'm part hippie a little red neck
I'm always a suspect
My blood line made me who I am

Daddy never finished school
But he shot one mean game of pool
Took a bullet for stealin' cars down in Birmingham

Mama always went to church
But we soon found out what her reasons were
She got caught at the local motel with the preacher man

I come from a long line of losers
Half outlaw half boozers
I was born with a shot glass in my hand
I'm part hippie a little red neck
I'm always a suspect
My blood line made me who I am

I come from a long line of losers
Half outlaw half boozers
I was born with a shot glass in my hand
I'm part hippie a little red neck
I'm always a suspect
My blood line made me who I am

I come from a long line of losers
Half outlaw half boozers
I was born with a shot glass in my hand
I'm part hippie a little red neck
I'm always a suspect
My blood line made me who I am


Isn't it a gamble layin' your heart out on the floor?
Nothin' short of a miracle
When you find the one you're looking for
It's another kind of trouble trying to hang on to who you are
When all you wanna do is lose yourself in someone else's arms
Isn't it a wonder (that) we got this far


Some people aren't lucky like us
Some people they just give up
When the hard times fall
The thrill of it all is gone
Leaves you in a cloud of dust
It's sad to think that some won't find it
And others won't recognize it even when it comes
We're all at the mercy of the will of love
Some people yeah
Some people aren't lucky like us


Two lonely souls that just stumbled into fate
Look how much we've been given babe
In spite of all of our mistakes
And I will never forget I've been blessed with the gift of lovin' you
And when the going ain't easy babe
A little faith will pull us through
Thank God we have eachother we can hang onto, yeah


Some people aren't lucky like us
Some people they just give up
When the hard times fall
The thrill of it all is gone
Leaves you in a cloud of dust
It's sad to think that some won't find it
And others won't recognize it even when it comes
We're all at the mercy of the will of love
Some people yeah
Some people aren't lucky like us


To have someone you can laugh with
Someone you can cry with
Tell all your secrets to
To have someone who won't judge you
Someone who just loves you
No matter what, they stand beside you


Some people aren't lucky like us
Some people they just give up
When the hard times fall
The thrill of it all is gone
Leaves you in a cloud of dust
It's sad to think that some won't find it
And others won't recognize it even when it comes
We're all at the mercy of the will of love
Some people yeah
Some people aren't, some people aren't lucky like us
Oh yeah
Some people aren't lucky like us


It was our first week
At Myrtle Beach
Where it all began

It was 102
Nothin' to do
Man it was hot
So we jumped in


We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget?


Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me
You and me


We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
So, let's just stay right here


'Til the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
Right then I knew
Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked at you


Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me
You and me


Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful


That blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me

First week in myrtle beach where it all began


Fast
That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back


Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast


Fast
That's what your parents said when they were falling in love
It's too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is


Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast


Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause, I would somehow
But it don't work like that


Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast

Oh, here I go again
Walking the line, killing time
Between my sins
Oh, why do I come here
The ending's still the same
I'm bringing back old tears
I act like I don't know
Where this road will go

Pour me something stronger
Pour me something straight
All these crooked voices
Make them go away
I can barely stand up
I can barely breathe
Pour me something stronger than me
Pour me something stronger than me

Sunrise hurts as much as you
You both come up when I
Don't want you to
Oh, I can still hear you say
That you and I will both
Be better off this way
These things that I run to
What I put my heart through

Pour me something stronger
Pour me something straight
All these crooked voices
Make them go away
I can barely stand up
I can barely breathe
Pour me something stronger than me

Pour me something stronger
Pour me something dark
Pour it up so high
'Til I can't feel my heart
I can barely stand up
I can barely breathe
Pour me something stronger than me
Pour me something stronger than me

Have I got the deal for you

Would you like to have a t-bone steak and lobster
Served on the finest china
Accompanied by a bottle of the world's greatest wine
Served in a crystal glass
Alone
Or would you rather have
A Big Mac, an order of fries, a cherry pie
Underneath a big oak tree
Sittin' on a blanket
Snuggled up with the one you love

CHORUS
I'll talk love over money
Forget the green, give me honey
Some people work work work their lives away
But I'll take love over money
Any day

Okay check this out
You're on the streets of Paris
Standing underneath the Ifle Tower
Surrounded by all the magical things the City of Romance has to offer
But you're all alone
Or would you rather be at the state fair
Standing in line for the Tilt-A-Whirl
Eatin' cotton candy
MMMM that's good
Drinking a Dr. Pepper
And stealing a kiss from the one you love

CHORUS

Okay now think about this
That's it, a low flowin', red slick, candy apple
Rockin' sled of a Farrari
Price tag 205 and some change
But no one and I mean absolutely no one will ever be in the passenger seat with you
Or would you rather have a 1989
Mud gray 150 extended cab with 4 wheel drive
And sittin' right next to you as close as the law will allow
Chewing bubble gum, singin' in your ear
Along with Lynyrd Skynyrd
Is the one you love

CHORUS (2 TIMES)


Tell me that you love me
Say we'll always work it out
I know it's kinda scary but it's only temporary doubt
I've done a lot of stupid things
But promise that you're gonna stay long enough
To grow old with me


We're gonna see the good times
Love each other through the bad
It's gonna hurt like hell when we lose our moms and dads
So let my shoulder hold your tears
Walk beside me through the years
Baby, let's see where this love can lead


Let's hold hands on your favorite beach
Fix up a house that we found in the city limits
Tangled up in a satin sheet
And get a little loud when we've had too much to drink
And learn to love from a church pew
Laugh about all the times we counted pennies
Buy some land with a good view to start family
Baby grow old with me


It's gonna take a little time
We'll have to work at it every day
We're gonna lose a lot of sleep
And learn to eat out of a microwave
You know we'll probably never have it all
But that's part of buildin' up the wall
Strong enough to stand up through the rain


We'll make some love on your favorite beach
Add to the house that we found in the city limits
Talk our babies through the bad dreams
When they get a little older we'll tell them not to drink
Book a church when she finds a groom
Laugh about all the times they'll count the pennies
Give em land with a good view to start a family


And baby you know we might
Take a turn on a bad road
Maybe go where the wind blows, baby
But end up right where we were meant to be, yeah
Back and forth on a porch swing
Hard not to smile thinkin' how it don't get much better
Our baby's baby's turnin' 18
What a family, hmmm


Baby grow old with me
Baby grow old with me
Baby grow old with me
Tell me that you love me
Say we'll always work it out

Ahh, Come on
Here we go

He was an underdog
A no threat
A nascar drunky
A rooky
A wanabe
Still wet behind the ears
A red line baron just jammin his gears
There are those that are
And those that ain't
The quickest get stickers
He was nothin but paint
Chartreuse paint

Then he rased
Now we cut to
The last 10 laps
And here comes Junior
Sneakin up from the back of the pack
With fire in his eyes
Wavin out the window
As he's passes em by
The tention mounts
Now he's number 2
All out of rubber
And runnin on fumes
He's door to door
Outta turn four
He sees those checkers
And he hears that roar

Chrous:
And the crowd goes wild!
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
And the crowd goes wild!

He played the Honky Tonks
The road side bars
A real hum dinger
A blue eyed singer
With a red guitar
Around his neck
Payin them dues
'Bout stoppin his debt
But he told his mama
Every time he come back
One of these days
I'm gona buy you a big, long Cadillac
And get you outta this shack

And then he hit the road
Frontin the band
6 long hairs bobbin up and down
In a Chevy van
All beat up
He did a lot of givin
But he never gave up
But one night
He wrote a song
Made a little record
That started catchin on
Now it's collisiums
He's all the rage
The lights go down
When he hits the stage

Chrous:
And the crowd goes wild!
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar
Hey

(Speaking)
"And heres the 2/2 to Parker
Hit high in deep, right field
Jones to the back
To the wall
Goodbye!"
"Setup is good
Kick is in the air
It's got the distance
It's good!"
"He gets the 4 main front
And 3 wide receavers
2 to the left
He goes back to throw
Has time
To the end zone
Touchdown!"

End Chorus:
And the crowd goes wild!
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar
And the crowd goes wild!
Whoa!
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
You're shinnin like a superstar


I ride east every other Friday but if I had it my way
The day would not be wasted on this drive
And I want so bad to hold you
Son, there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me couldn't get along


So I'll drive
And I think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride


A day might come and you'll realize that if you could see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son please don't mistake me for a man that didn't care at all


And I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride


So when you drive
And the years go flying by
I hope you smile
If I ever cross your mind
It was a pleasure of my life
And I cherished every time
And my whole world
It begins and ends with you
On that Highway 20 ride


I don't know why I love women
That love to do me wrong
I don't know why my life sounds like
A heartbroke country song
I ain't really happy
Until the sky starts driving rain
Maybe I just get off on the pain

My whole life I been picking fights
There ain't no way to win
There's a hundred scars and shoulda-run-aways
Now tattooed on my skin
There's a side of me that just won't stop
Dancin' in the flame
Maybe I just get off on the pain


Cause I love the long shots
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack
With the dark horses
I ride the wrong road
Just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain


I wake up every morning
A thousand miles from home
Praying for forgiveness
For this aching in my bones
It would be so easy
To find a better way
Oh, but I know I'll never change


Cause I love the long shots
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack
With the dark horses
I ride the wrong road
Just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain


Cause I love the long shots
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack
With the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
I know I'm the only one to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain


Love is so beautiful
When everything is fine
But when it is like hers and mine
It lives and dies at least
Ten Thousand
Times


Tell me something bad about Tulsa
How those old oil wells
Smell in the wind
Tell me something bad about Tulsa
So I won't have to go back
Believing I belong there
Again


Eyes as blue as Tulsa skis
I kept getting lost in when I met her
Hair like Oklahoma sand
I could run my hands through forever
But all good things must end
All rivers have to bend
I keep running out
But she keeps pulling me back in




Tell me something bad about Tulsa
So I won't have to go back
Believing I belong there
Again

He was warmin' his hands with a hot coffee cup
And pourin' in whiskey
As I walked up, he never blinked an eye
He just asked for a light

I noticed he didn't have soles on his shoes
So I pulled out a twenty, said go buy some food
But he just stared at his cup like I wasn't there
Then he looked at me, said son that's nice
But there's some things money can't buy

I want my life back, I want that house that I called home
I want that job I worked for 22 years before I got laid off
I want what I had when I laid down in the arms
Of the woman that believed in me and that man I used to be
I want my life back

I walked through the door and sat down at the bar
Had a shot and a beer, lit up a cigar
It ran through my head, every word that old man said

I had a woman that loved me with all of her heart
But my pride and my temper made it all fall apart
I was too headstrong to admit when I was wrong
It's been 6 months since she moved out
Guess my pride ain't helping me now

I want my life back, I want that house that I called home
I want to hear her voice and see her face every day when I get off
I want what I had when I laid down in the arms
Of the woman that believed in me and that man I used to be
I want my life back

I paid my tab and left that bar
I grabbed my phone, jumped in my car
I dialed her number and when she said hello, I said

I want my life back, I want that house that I called home
I want to hear your voice and see your face every day when I get off
I want what I had when I laid down in the arms
Of the woman that believed in me and the man I used to be
I want my life back, I want my life back


Hey baby, is that you?
Wow, your hair got so long
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I really do
Norma Jean, ain't that the song
We'd sing in the car
Driving downtown, top down
Making the rounds
Checking out the bands
On Doheeney Avenue
Yeah, life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me, I swung and I missed
And the next thing ya know
I'm reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams
Wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again


I wake up in tear drops
That fall down like rain
I put on that old song
We danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock
Head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed
Dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days

Yeah, that's what I'm doing


Someone told me after college
You ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Wow, that ain't the girl I knew
Me, I've been a few places
Mostly here and there, once or twice
Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright
Yeah, it's good to see you too
Well, hey girl, you're late
And those planes, they don't wait
But if you ever come back around
This sleepy old town
Promise me you'll stop in
To see an old friend
And until then...








I wake up in tear drops
That fall down like rain
I put on that old song
We danced to and then

Ha ha


Welcome to the home of the hillbilly
Yeah, baby
It's a land of barbed wire and moonshine whiskey
Park your car before you get it stuck
Go on, grab you a beer
And get on up in the truck
It's going down tonight
It's all on me
It's BYOB and I got all we need
Yeah, boy, I'm 'bout to show me a city slicker
How to kick it in the sticks with the critters down on


Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows
If it don't you're going broke
So we
We hang out by the bonfire
Just some good all boys having a dang good time
We crank it up (down here)
We get loud (down here)
Throwing down in the dirty, dirty south (down here)
Be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
Jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks


So pop a top and drop a tailgate
Yeah, we're cranking up AC/DC, Hank, Skynyrd, and George Strait
Where's the girls?
'Bout to call 'em up
A little southern drawl said, "Hey trouble what's up?
It's going down tonight
Now they're pulling up
We got the jacked up trucks slap covered in mud
Bikini tops and Daisy Duke denim
Hopping out singing 'Outlaw Women' down on


Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows
If it don't you're going broke
So we
We hang out by the bonfire
Just some good all boys having a dang good time
We crank it up (down here)
We get loud (down here)
Throwing down in the dirty, dirty south (down here)
Be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
Jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks


Hey, boy, hit this Mason jar one time
Burned you a little bit, didn't it?
Ever been snipe hunting?
Come on
We'll do a little frog gigging, cow tipping
How 'bout a little skinny dipping, bass fishing
Take it easy on the 'shine
And stay away from other boys' women
That's one damn good way for a man to get it whooped down
These boys are tough down here
Get your ass tore up down here
And be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
Jocks and bikers, they all came


Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows
If it don't you're going broke
So we
We hang out by the bonfire
Just some good all boys having a dang good time
We crank it up (down here)
We get loud (down here)
Throwing down in the dirty, dirty south (down here)
Be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
Jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks


Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like Kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it


So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all


She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different sound
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me


I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords


I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing a-long


She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different sound
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me


She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me

Collar's wet on the back of my neck
And the sweat, it burns my eyes
Day in, day out, it's all the same
On this hot assembly line

I watch the hours of my life
Get chewed up by that clock
I'm gonna lose my mind if I don't find
A way out of this box

Stuck in a rut
Stuck in this town
Stuck in a job that's keeping me down
I need to get these boots out of the mud

It's time to roll on, get in a groove
Pull up the stakes and make me a move
A spin of the wheel is bound to change my luck
I ain't stayin' stuck

I'm gonna take every dollar that I made
Out of that farmer's bank
Make one last stop at the Tiger mart
Gonna fill up that thirsty tank

Gonna find a road to a new zip code
They can kiss my hotel lights
It's never too late to start again
I've wasted too much time

Stuck in a rut
Stuck in this town
Stuck in a job that's keeping me down
I need to get these boots out of the mud

It's time to roll on, get in a groove
Pull up the stakes and make me a move
A spin of the wheel is bound to change my luck
I ain't stayin' stuck

I'm a little burned out
A little ticked off
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, sometimes Sunday

Stuck in a rut
Stuck in this town
Stuck in a job that's keeping me down
I need to get these boots out of the mud

It's time to roll on, get in a groove
Pull up the stakes and make me a move
A spin of the wheel is bound to change my luck
I ain't stayin' stuck, no, no

Stuck

Oh

Maybe tonight
We could close the door and lock ourselves inside
Take time to feel
I don't want to miss the chance to be so real
The days all fly away and I forget the truth
Everything that matters, is, in this room

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me

My heart is yours
And every part of me still wants to give you more
More time to love
'Cos you never know when life will leave us
I want to take in all the beauty here
Oh, let the world around us just disappear

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me
Oh lie next to me

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me

When you lie next to me

I can barely feels the sheets with all these crumbs down in my bed, oh no
How can I get to sleep with all this buzzin' in my head?
An' who'd've ever thought I'd not complain about a mess?
Serves me right, I guess:
This is what I get for eatin' crackers with my gin
An' drinkin' in my Sunday dress

Telephone is by the bottle which is always by my bed
Time to time I give it a rattle to make sure that it's not dead
I will wait here for your call till I run out of cigarettes
I love to play the part of the damsel in distress
Flickin' ashes in my coffee
Drinkin' in my Sunday dress

Well I've been on the road to this
An' I've been on the way to this
But who'd 'a think it'd come to this?
Don't let on you've seen me like this, like this

My old transistor's soundin' just as twangy as a Fender
My radiator growls like Elvis after Sunday dinner
I've drained my last Tequila and I've thrown away the blender
I've poured out all the wine; from now on nothin' but the best:
Cognac an' Patsy Cline
While drinkin' in my Sunday dress

Well I've been on the road to this
An' I've been on the way to this
I surely ain't a hypocrite:
I've had my fun and now I must confess

Our reverend is a kingly soul; repents 'em on a dime
His Bible is not inked in gold, he is not the cheatin' kind
One Sunday after meetin', I was in the greetin' line
He said: "I've seen you from the altar
"Gulpin' down Communion wine."
"Just remember who's beside you when it's no business of mine."
I said: "Just remember who's beside you when it's no business of mine."


When darkness falls upon your heart and soul
I'll be the light that shines for you
When you forget how beautiful you are
I'll be there to remind you
When you can't find your way
I'll find my way to you
When troubles come around
I will come to you


I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be


And when you're there with no one there to hold
I'll be the arms that reach for you
And when you feel your faith is running low
I'll be there to believe in you
When all you find are lies
I'll be the truth you need
When you need someone to run to
You can run to me


I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be


I'll be the sun
When your heart's filled with rain
I'll be the one
To chase the rain away


I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be

In a crowded room I wanna hold your hand
Wanna kiss your lips like a desperate man
When I hear your voice callin my name
I'll come runnin to you as fast as I can

No shame no holding back baby
Insane cause you make me so crazy
No way I can look cool baby no shame

I left them all laughing
I left a full beer
Left rubber on the road
Just getting over here
Let my pride on that barstool
Just sittin there they all say I'm all hopeless
But I just don't care

No shame no holding back baby
Insane cause you make me so crazy
No way I can look cool baby no shame

No shame no holding back baby
Insane cause you make me so crazy
No way I can look cool baby no shame

No shame no shame no shame


I was standing in the grocery store line
The one they marked express
When this woman came through with about 25 things
And I said don't you know that more is less
She said this world is moving so fast
I just get more behind with every day
And every morning when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way
All I could say was


Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain


He was walking by the other day and I said
Hey baby, how you've been
Yeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin
And you only wanted what you can't have
And baby you can't have me now
I gave my heart to another
Yeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family and we got each other
And I found out the hard way that




You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives and drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walking around in a culture of darkness
Living together alone, all I can say is




And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty
And together we'll make a stand


Somewhere 'cross the parking lot some bands playing out of tune
City streets are going burn if we don't do something soon
And señorita can't quit crying
Baby's due now any day
Don Juan left got sick of trying
No one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store
And she said I want to buy a little carton of milk
But I don't have any money
I said hey I'll cover you honey
Because the pain's got to go somewhere
Yeah the pain's got to go someplace
So come on down to my house
Don't you know that




Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't know what you do
You don't know how bad you turn me on
You don't know what it does
You don't know how you don't do no wrong
You got me wrapped around your little finger
Oh, good lookin' girl
That little dimple when you smile might as well be a hook in my heart
It's so simple how I feel
I gotta just be wherever you are
Every time I pick you up
It's like you start...


Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, "oh boy you got it so damn good"


Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't have to say a thing
Just sit there and let me sing to you
Let the sun lit down, and the moon come around and just move ya
And let me just get lost in how good looking girl
You can be when you don't even need because it's so natural
With your hair pulled up and my hat girl you know I can't handle
Some things I just can't handle
Cause you start


Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, "oh boy you got it so good with this good looking girl"


Good morning good looking girl
I ain't never felt nothing quite like when you're...


Rocking me, rocking me, gotta roll with it
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
And I'm gonna lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, "oh boy you got it so good with this good looking girl"


You're my good looking girl
What's up girl

You don't know what you do to me
You changed around the scenery
And now everything is new to me
But it looks just right,yeah it looks just right
Whoa,it's strange but it's beautiful
Yeah,and I know where I am

Oh,I never been here before
I've never been loved like this
Never been tumblin',stumblin' over the words that get tangled inside of me
I've never been moved this way
Nobody's ever made me say
I'm 99.9% sure I've never been here before

I'm walkin' in a wonderland
Gone ever since it all began
And I don't even want to understand
'Cause it feels that good,yeah it feels that good
It's a state that ain't on a map
Yet I know where I'm at

Oh,I've never been here before
I've never been loved like this
Never been tumblin',stumblin' over words that get tangled inside of me
I've never been moved this way
Nobody's ever made me say
99.9% sure I've never been here before
Ninety-nine point,ninety-nine point
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na
Ninety-nine point,ninety-nine point
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na

It's a state that ain't on a map
Yet I know where I'm at

Oh,I never been here before
I've never been loved like this
Never been tumblin',stumblin' over the words that get tangled inside of me
I've never been moved this way
Nobody's ever made me say
I'm 99.9% sure I've never been here before

I've never been here before
I've never been loved this this
Never been tumblin,stumblin' over the words that get tangled inside of me
I've never been moved this way
Nobody's ever made me say
99.9% sure I've never been here before

No,I've never been here before
I've never been here before (I've never moved this way)
I've never been here before
99.9% sure I've never been here before

Girl I know you're busy and that ain't nothing new
Girl lay it on the line cause there's nothing left to lose
Gonna call it like it is I'm done being used
You don't wanna be together but you know it ain't true
And all I can say is I don't know how to say it
You're the high I keep chasing and I'm the song you keep playing
And never let it fade out

Everytime it's feeling right
You go and do me wrong
And by the morning light
You wanna turn it off
So tell me why I play the fool again

When I start to let it go
You go and pull me in
Until I get to close
And then you're over this
Yeah but you still wanna steal my kiss

I don't mean to bother just thought you'd like to know
I won't be picking up just to be that old hello
It's a two am tequila another last call
It's only when you're lonely that you want me at all
And all I can say is I don't know how to say it
But you're the high I keep chasing and I'm the song you keep playing
And never let it fade out

Everytime it's feeling right
You go and do me wrong
And by the morning light
You wanna turn it off
So tell me why I play the fool again

When I start to let it go
You go and pull me in
Until I get to close
And then you're over this
Yeah but you still wanna steal my kiss

Covers, covers, pretend there's no other
Until I discover we're laying on a bed of lies
I try to give in give all my attention
Were wasted on a change of mind
So tell me why

Everytime it's feeling right
You go and do me wrong
And by the morning light
You wanna turn it off
So tell me why I play the fool again

When I start to let it go
You go and pull me in
Until I get to close
And then you're over this
Yeah but you still wanna steal my kiss
Steal my kiss
Steal my kiss


The bluest skies don't seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that you're around, you put 'em all to shame
Let me break it down 'cause what I'm trying to say is


No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you


Gotta whole new direction, it seems, these days
I used to rush off to work and get home late
But now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different, I can't leave you alone


No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you


Girl, if you ever get to guessing if I'm thinking 'bout you
Just remember that


No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you, you, you
You, oh, you

I feel like I'm standin' on a mountaintop
Baby when I hold your hand
Well that's where I am
This feelin' rises up inside of me
Oh it's like a gentle wind
Breathin' life into me again
Whatever I thought I ever wanted before
When I look in your eyes
You make me believe that
There's just so much more

Baby you're my inspiration
You lift me to a higher place
You're the one sweet dream
I can keep my faith in
You're the light that shines in me
My hopes my destiny
Oh you'll always be
My inspiration

Sometimes when I look at you
Thoughts start fillin' my head
It's like a melody that comes along
And I'm singin' it all day long
Just seein' you smile brings out the best in me
When I've gone as far as I can go
You stir something down deep in my soul
Nothin' else on earth can make me feel like you
Oh with you in my life I gotta reason
For everything that I do

Baby you're my inspiration
You lift me to a higher place
You're the one sweet dream
I can keep my faith in
You're the light that shines in me
My hopes my destiny
Oh you'll always be
My inspiration

Baby you're my inspiration
You lift me to a higher place
You're the one sweet dream
I can keep my faith in
You're the light that shines in me
My hopes my destiny
Oh you'll always be
My inspiration


Them jeans are faded
In all the right places
You got me hanging on tight to your curves like little E races
Girl your funky little back beat has got me
Feel like I’m tipsy
And I ain’t even had a drink


I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you’re doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a lets go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning


Oh you little outlaw
Stealing my heart and all
When you drop it down low
Touch your toes girl
You know you just show it off
That little tattoo on your tan line, oh my
Pretty little butterfly
What else have you got to hide?

 x2
I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you’re doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a lets go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning, morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning


Bet you think I'm sitting at home, naw
Bet you think that I'm all alone, naw
I bet you think I'm missing you and wishing you would call my phone
Hell naw
I went wheels up on a runway
And that ticket was a one-way


I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach


Heard you called my boys
Heard you called my folks
They said you drove by my house real slow
You can check any spot, roll down every road
But girl, I ain't even close


I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach


I wish it could've worked out
But I'm gettin' over you now
On a beach towel
My shades on
My drink's up and the sun's out
I'm somewhere on a beach


I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach


Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

He grew up in a time
When a third-grade education
Was all the school you needed
To work the family farm
He'd take time off on Sunday
Him and all his family
Warm a pew
And give thanks to the Lord

There was no gray, only black and white
Didn't need no-one to tell him
What was wrong or right
'Cause he had God, Family, and Country

He set aside his plow
In early 1940
Said goodbye to his small town
And put on the Army green
Hard Times on the front lines
Writin' letters on wet paper
Not one word about the awful things he'd seen

His was a generation
That answered without question
They knew they had to win
'Cause they were fightin' for...
God, Family, and Country

On the coffee table
Sits the family Bible
Where just last year he added
A little boy to the family tree

There's the folded flag they gave us
On the day he left us
But the thing that I remember most
Is the way that he...

Believed...

In God, Family, and Country...

Ohhh, we've got God...

Family...

And Country...

Not planning our day around a TV set
Paying our bills and staying out of debt
That's important to me
That's important to me

Opening the windows and letting in air
Holding hands when we're saying a prayer
That's important to me
Yeah, that's important to me

Having somebody to share my life
Loving my husband and being a wife
And the very best mother I can be
That's important to me

Telling the truth and being real
Feeding my family a home cooked meal
That's important to me
That's important to me

Planting a garden and watching it grow
Keeping it country on the radio
That's important to me
Yeah, that's important to me

Always having you to hold
Being beside you when we grow old
And they plant us 'neath that big old tree
That's important to me

Always having you to hold
Being beside you when we grow old
And they plant us 'neath that big old tree

Believing our dreams will take us somewhere
Still being ourselves if we ever get there
That's important to me
That's important to me

Yeah, that's important to me
That's important to me

That's important to me


Honey suckle in the air, breeze blowing through your hair
Hundred stars hanging high, under your still tide
Up in every move you make, baby I'm your DJ
You're my favorite song, won't you let me sing along


Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and you're spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights


Heart beating like a drum, call me the lucky one
Shining these Hi-Beams on you baby
Boots stiring up the dirt Cottonfield concert
You got the beautiful, I got the cooler full


Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and you're spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights


Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere (nowhere)
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
Oh, oh, oh


I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and you're spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights


I love my life, love my husband
Without those kid's, man I ain't nothing
I love my fans, love my band
Love my little Tennessee piece of land
Sometimes my life can get so hectic
Out of the blue when I least expect it
Somewhere between the hubbub and the drama
I get to thinking bout mama and


I'm caught up in missing Missouri
'Cause I wanna be with my family
Instead of stuck out on this road I'm on
Every time my bus wheels hit the bootheel
There's no limelight and I'm alright
'Cause I'm almost home
Where they love me, where they know me
Where they show me back in Missouri


The road just ain't no place for whiners
It's motels, truck stops, all night diners
Hoping that your song'll sell
And having to smile when it ain't doing well
So when everything just gets to much
And I feel like I'm giving up
I close my eyes and say a little prayer
And its like I'm there and




Late summer nights sneaking out the window
Me and the girls driving down the back roads
Tobacco fields and bumblebees
And the cardinals playing on TV




I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince


And I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


He said, "Look at you
Worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"


Like, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream




Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams


Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?


Gotta hold on easy as I let you go
Gonna tell you how much I love you, though you think you already know
I remember I thought you looked like an angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm
You've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born


You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl


When you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you, I've turned around and you've almost grown
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper "I Love You!" in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say, "Daddy Love You More!"


You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl


Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say "yes" to him unless I know, he's the half
That makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough!


You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

She's never pulled anybody from a burning building
She's never rocked Central Park
To a half a million fans screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game

She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon
Ride around the world
No, she's just your everyday average girl
(But)

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned-up knee
A little kiss is all she needs

The keeper of the Cheerios
The voice that brings Snow White to life
Bedtime stories every night
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

She didn't get a check
Every week like a nine-to-fiver
But she's been a waiter and a cook and a taxi driver
For twenty years there at home
Until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition

But now her baby's moving on
And she'll soon be missing her
But not today
Those are tears of joy runnin' down her face

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest

It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle
She walks right by
Looks back into her mother's eyes
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

Thirty years have flown right past
Her daughter's staring at
All the photographs of her mother
And she wishes she could be like that
Oh but she already is

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home

She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her mama with a spoon
And that smile lets her know
Her mother's smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero


Ooo, Ooo, Ooo-come on
Still feels good-oh,oh,oh


That old t-shirt you wear to bed
Hanging off your shoulder by a thread
The one you ripped off me when
We first met
Still feels good
That old familiar song blaring
From my car
We know every note, every word
By heart
Puts a smile on your face because
You know it's ours
And it still feels good


Your fingers hooked around
My belt loops
Leaning up against my ride
Remember that first time I touched you
It doesn't matter-I've held you a
Million times
Oh, and it still feels good


We made some crazy plans, had some
Crazy dreams
And now that we've reached
A few you would think
That it would get old to you and me
But it still feels good, still feels good




Oh, your fingers hooked around
My belt loops
Leaning up against my ride
Remember the first time I touched you
It doesn't matter, I've held you-
I've touched you
I've felt you-I've loved you-
And it still feels good


Yeah and it still feels good, baby
Yeah, it still feels good-yeah, yeah, yeah
Still feels good
Still feels good, baby


Nineteen
Number on his back
Voted captain of his high school football team
Took us all the way to State
Got a scholarship to play down in Tennessee

Said he could run, he could duck
He could throw, he could go
Like you never seen
Nineteen

On the day those twin towers came down
His whole world turned around
He told them all, "You all, I can't play ball
There's a war on now"

So he marched right in with a few good men
And joined the Marines
Nineteen


He's the boy next door
He might have carried your bags at the grocery store
Now he's somebody's son in a hole with a gun
In some foreign land
Trying to hold on to his American Dreams, nineteen


There's a sniper out there in the dark somewhere
And a soldier down
Need someone who can run, who can duck
And go get him out

It takes one good man to raise his hand
Take one for the team
How about you, nineteen?




Brought him home today
With the big parade down on main street
Gave him a purple heart, a silver star
Soldier gave a speech

Said, "He could run, he could duck, he could throw
He's the one who rescued me"
Said, "He could have played for Tennessee"


Um, number nineteen
He was nineteen


A car's got gasoline to run, down the road
A crop's got rain, dirt and sun, to make 'em grow
A song's got rhyme
A clock's got time
You got me and


Baby I got you
Yeah you're it
The missing piece that makes me fit
I got you, the breath I breathe
And there ain't nothing else I need
Baby I got you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah


I don't need a big ol' house, full of stuff
What my arms are wrapped around, that's enough
Your morning smile, your kiss goodnight

And everything's alright


'Cause I got you
Yeah you're it
The missing piece that makes me fit
I got you, the breath I breathe
And there ain't nothing else I need
Baby I got you



When the right goes wrong

When I'm scared to death and got nothing left to lean on



I got you

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah I do

Baby I got you

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah you got me too


I got you
Yeah you're it
The missing piece that makes me fit
I got you, the breath I breathe
And there ain't nothing else I need
Baby I got you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah



Yeah baby

I got you

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Baby I got you
Baby I got you


Might as well have my alarm
Set on my phone girl
It's like you got a camera
Don't know how you know
I'm home alone girl
Come around 10:47 every Friday night
Might as well leave the light on
'Cause you're always right on time


You call, I say hello
You knock, I'm letting you in
You say you've missed my lips
We kiss, here we go again
Your dress, my shirt
We love, I live and never learn
I crash, I burn, you leave, I hurt
Like clockwork


It's like I'm walking down the street
And fall in that same trap girl
I see a freight train coming
And I just stand there on the tracks girl
Somebody'd be getting rich if they were placing bets
On me thinking no, no, no, always saying yes


You call, I say hello
You knock, I'm letting you in
You say you've missed my lips
We kiss, here we go again
Your dress, my shirt
We love, I live and never learn
I crash, I burn, you leave, I hurt
Like clockwork


It's too easy, you know my street
And you know where I leave my key
Baby you know me, I can count on you to count on me
It's like a movie I've seen a thousand times
I hate the end but I still hit rewind


You call, I say hello
You knock, I'm letting you in
You say you've missed my lips
We kiss, here we go again
Your dress, my shirt
We love, I live and never learn
I crash, I burn, you leave, I hurt
Like clockwork


Like clockwork, clockwork
Clockwork
Like clockwork, clockwork

Don't need no whiskey
When I've had a bad day
No prescription honey
When my skies are grey

No poppin the pills
No smokin the pills
That make me feel okay
But you go down easy baby
I could drink you by the case

You're my painkiller
A little dose of you goes a long long way
You're my painkiller
Oh will you take it away
You take it away

Don't need no fixin'
I don't need no therapy
You're love drunk kissin
Is my kinda remedy
You're always lookin to fall
You're like the hair of the dog
When I'm feelin cursed
Don't need no doctor honey
I don't need no nurse

You're my painkiller
A little dose of you goes a long long way
You're my painkiller
Oh will you take it away
You take it away
Oh you take it away
You take it away

Ah La la la la la la la
Ooh Ooh
La la la la la la la
Ooh ooh
La la la la la la la
Ooh Ooh

Hey you're my painkiller
A little dose of you goes a long long way
You're my painkiller
Oh you take it away
You take it away
Oh you take it away
You take it away


I heard a song about a rambling man
Bought a guitar and I started a band
I got a gig at the local Am Vet
I was gone and I am not back yet

69 bored, out and jacked up
A quarter mile that was all it was
I burned the cool off of that Corvette
And I was gone and I am not back yet


Looking back at the moments, black and white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever


She was a cut offs pepper sauce queen
Man, we were matches and gasoline
First taste of love never will forget
I was gone and I am not back yet
I was gone, gone and I am not back yet


Looking back at the moments, black white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever
The laughs, the smiles, the trials, the tears
It's hard to hate what got me here
What got me here


She was a straight out of Hollywood smile
We missed it all by a country mile
Went out one night for some cigarettes
And I was gone and I am not back yet


I was gone, gone and I am not back yet
I was gone and I am not back
I am not back, am not back yet


People always coming up to me and asking
"Dolly, what's your secret?
With all you do, your attitude
Just seems to be so good
How do you keep it?"
Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try
To offer up a few words of advice


You better get to living, giving
Don't forget to throw in a little forgiving
And loving on the way
You better get to knowing, showing
A little bit more concerned about where you're going
Just a word unto the wise
You better get to living


A girlfriend came to my house
Started crying on my shoulder Sunday evening
She was spinning such a sad tale
I could not believe the yarn that she was weaving
So negative the words she had to say
I said if I had a violin I'd play


I said you'd better get to living, giving
Be willing and forgiving
Cause all healing has to start with you
You better stop whining, pining
Get your dreams in line
And then just shine, design, refine
Until they come true
And you better get to living


Your life's a wreck, your house is mess
And your wardrobe way outdated
All your plans just keep on falling through
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you
This I know is true


You better get to living, giving
A little more thought about being
A little more willing to make a better way
Don't sweat the small stuff
Keep your chin up
Just hang tough
And if it gets too rough
Fall on your knees and pray
And do that everyday
Then you'll get to living


The day we're born we start to die
Don't waste one minute of this life
Get to living
Share your dreams and share your laughter
Make some points for the great hereafter


Better start caring
Better start sharing
Better start trying
Better start smiling
And you better get to living

I haven't been to church since I don't remember when
Things were going great til they fell apart again
So I listened to the preacher as he told me what to do
He said you can't go hatin' others who have done wrong to you
Sometimes we get angry but we must not condemn
Let the good Lord do his job, you just pray for them

I pray your brakes go out runnin' down a hill
I pray a flower pot falls from a window sill
And knocks you in the head like I'd like to
I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls
I pray you're flyin' high when your engine stalls
I pray all your dreams never come true
Just know wherever you are, honey, I pray for you

I'm really glad I found my way to church
Cause I'm already feelin' better and I thank God for the words
Yeah, I'm gonna take the high road and do what the preacher told me to do
You keep messin' up, and I'll keep prayin' for you

I pray your tire goes out at 110
I pray you pass out drunk with your best friend
And wake up with his and her tattoos

I pray your brakes go out runnin' down a hill
I pray a flower pot falls from a window sill
And knocks you in the head like I'd like to
I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls
I pray you're flyin' high when your engine stalls
I pray all your dreams never come true
Just know wherever you are, near or far
In your house or in your car
Wherever you are, honey, I pray for you
I pray for you

All things considered I'm doin' just fine even though
You left a hole the size of Texas deep inside of my heart
The way I feel I should be losing my mind
But all things considered
I'm doin' just fine

Woke up this morning to the sound of you slammin' the door
I got served a piece of paper for breakfast that said
You don't live here no more
And the dog won't let me pet him, he just lays around
And growls at my feet
And the paper boy forgot me again
I should have stayed in bed asleep

All things considered I'm doin' just fine even though
You left a hole the size of Texas deep inside of my heart
The way I feel I should be losing my mind
But all things considered
I'm doin' just fine

Well my car broke down again right before it ran out of gas
Yeah my boss is still ringing in my head
One more time and your out on your...yeah
Well I can't wait till that five o clock whistle blows
So I can sit in traffic all day
And end up going home alone

All things considered I'm doin' just fine even though
You left a hole the size of Texas deep inside of my heart
The way I feel I should be losing my mind
But all things considered
I'm doin' just fine

All things considered I'm doin' just fine even though
You left a hole the size of Texas deep inside of my heart
The way I feel I should be losing my mind
But all things considered
I'm doin' just fine


When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
It always winds up feelin' more like a job interview
My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run


I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lyin' there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and prayed that she'd say yes


And then all of a sudden, oh, it seemed so strange to me
How we went from somethin's missin' to a family
Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be


I met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in


And now all of a sudden, oh, it seems so strange to me
How we've gone from somethin's missin' to a family
Lookin' through the glass I think about the man that's standin' next to me
And I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be


And lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be


Yeah, I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be
Because he didn't have to be
You know he didn't have to be


Don't you dare go runnin' down my little town where I grew up
And I won't cuss your city lights
If you ain't ever took a ride around and cruised right through the heart of my town
Anything you say would be a lie


We may live our lives a little slower
But that don't mean I wouldn't be proud to show ya


Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turnin' up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, nobody's gonna call the cops
Where I come from


See that door right there, man, I swear that it ain't never been locked
And I guarantee that it never will
That old man right there in the rockin' chair at the courthouse square, I'll tell you now
He could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills


Don't let those faded overalls fool ya
He made his millions without one day of schoolin'


Where I come from
There's a pickup truck with the tailgate down
Where I come from
The pine trees are singin' a song of the south
Where I come from
That little white church is gonna have a crowd
And yeah, I'm pretty damn proud
Of where I come from


Where I come from
There's a big ol' moon shinin' down at night
Where I come from
There's a man done wrong, gonna make it right


Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turnin' up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, ain't nobody gonna call the cops


Yeah, that river runs across that old flint rock
Where I come from
Where I come from

Well, the seasons come, and the seasons go
And the reason you left, guess I'll never know
There will be others, yes, I know it's true
But they won't do you like I did for you

My love will not change
My love will not change
It just rolls like a river to the sea of your name
My love will not change
My love will not change
It's as steady as the rhythm of the pouring rain

Strong as a wind across a mountain top
Hey, my love is moving and it just won't stop
I turned you loose, honey, I let you fly
Now all I can do is hang my little head and cry

My love will not change
My love will not change
It just rolls like a river to the sea of your name
My love will not change
My love will not change
It's as steady as the rhythm of the pouring rain

My love will not change
My love will not change
Might as well try holdin' back a fast freight train
My love will not change
My love will not change
Baby, ask me tomorrow and I'll tell you the same

My love will not change
My love will not change
It just rolls like a river to the sea of your name
My love will not change
My love will not change
It's as steady as the rhythm of the pouring rain

Hey, my love will not change
My love will not change

Yeah, my love will not change
My love will not change

Yeah, my love will not change
My love will not change

Hey, my love will not change
My love will not change


Well it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight


And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul I know that I'm the same way
That I really always been


Because a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just cause everybody knows her name
Isn't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around this world
But you all I'm still a Mississippi girl


Well I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams, yeah




Mississippi girl
Oh
Mississippi girl
Mississippi girl
Yeah yeah
Oh oh
Mississippi girl


Send your kisses my way
Bring your sweet heart to me
I’ve been waiting for so long

Tell me all your stories
Leave some open for me
Write your name into this song


I’ll walk through the fire
I’ll run through the rain
I’ll wait for forever
If Love is your name
Your name


Catch a wind from heaven
Sail down while I’m sleeping
Wake me with the morning sun
Oh, oh- oh
I’ll dream of you until you come


I’ll walk through the fire
I’ll run through the rain
I’ll Wait for forever
If Love is your name


Valentines keep knocking
My heart keeps on walking
Darling I’ll hold on for you
For You, for you


I’ll walk through the fire
I’ll run through the rain
I’ll wait for forever
If Love is your name


If love is your name
If love is your name


Standin' at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hardwood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can’t get it back
Let’s face it
For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring rain drops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step and said
I see the way out and I‘m gonna take it


I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted


Another glass of whiskey, but it still don’t kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it


'Cause I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin' no more time
Wasted


She kept driving along
Till the moon and the sun were floating side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while
Hey, yeah


Oh, I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin' no more time
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin’ no more time
Wasted


I don't care that you done me wrong
'Cause I've already moved on
I don't care what his name is
Girl, it is what it is
I won't waste a dime
Or the bartender's time
Trying to catch a buzz
Over the thought of us


But I'll drink to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'll raise my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey


It don't matter what your friends say
They never liked me anyway
So if they see me drunk in this bar
It ain't over a broken heart


Cause I'm drinking to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'm raising my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey

Cheers to a good country song
To another long work week gone
And, yeah, I'm raising my glass to those savin' our ass overseas
I might stay for one more round
Hell, I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
No, don't think for one second I'm out to drown your memory
Girl, you ain't worth the whiskey, no
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey


No country music was harmed in the making of this song
This is only a test-t-t


Well, I wish I had some shoes
On my two bare feet
And it's getting kinda cold
In these painted on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day?
Yeah, baby


I hear you over there
On your tailgate whistlin' 
Sayin' "hey, girl"
But you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name
And to you, it ain't "pretty little thing"
"Hottie" or "baby"
It's driving me red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck crazy
Being the


Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck
Keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song


Well, shakin' my moneymaker
Ain't never made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you
In this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time
"You gotta get you some of that"
Sure, I'll slide on over
But you're gonna get slapped
Ha, these days, it ain't easy bein' that


Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck
Keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song


(Yep, yep, yeah, baby)
Aw, naw, Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw, y'all, we ain't a cliche
That ain't no way to treat a lady
Like a


Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for
Is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend
Nothing more
(Woo)
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut
And ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song


I ain't your tan-legged Juliet!
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw, naw

Sometimes it's hard to don't wanna look over your shoulder
'Cause you don't want to remember where you've been
There'll come a time you die
If you could only hold her
'Cause I know that's where I am

So listen with all your heart
Hold it inside forever
You may find all your dreams have already come true
Look inside and find the part that's leading you
'Cause that's the beat of a heart

Sometimes you'll drown it out with all your rage and thunder
Sometimes you'll drown it out with all your tears
There'll come a time when you hear it and you'll wonder
"Where in the world have I been?"

So listen with all your heart
Hold it inside forever
You may find all your dreams have already come true
Look inside and find the part that's leading you
'Cause that's the beat of a heart
No one can tell you how to get there
It's a road you take all by yourself
All by yourself
All by yourself

So listen with all your heart
Hold it inside forever
You may find all your dreams have already come true
Look inside and find the part that's leading you
'Cause that's the beat of
Oh it's the sweetest sound
'Cause that's the beat of a heart


Like a honeybee beating on my screen door
I got a little buzz and my head is sore
And from my bed I can feel the sun
Lord I hear the morning come


Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping


You shot outta hell like a bullet from a gun
A flip of a switch
A thief on the run
And since the day you left me baby
I can feel the lonely
I can hear the crazy


Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping


Head for the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
And live in a glass
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers
Kinda like molasses in late December


Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping


 Your cocaine kiss and caffeine love
 Your caffeine kiss and nicotine love
Got under my skin and into my blood
That need you back comes over me
Like ivy crawling up a hickory tree


Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping


Head to the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
And live in a glass
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers
Kinda like molasses in late December


Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping


Break it down, down, down, down
Just last night I saw the light
At the end of that tunnel on the other side
Thought I found my way outta this pain
Only to find your memory train
Creeping, creeping, creeping, creeping


Yeah


Everybody, they think they know us
They think they've got us figured out
Waste their words just trying to tell us
How the typical, predictable, young love turns out

Yeah-yeah
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na


But little do they know girl, we've got a fast car
A James Dean spirit and a Norma Jean heart
This blank sheet of paper has been waiting forever
So baby, just tell me where you wanna start


You and I can fall as hard as we want
Make the story all our own and blow Shakespeare’s mind
It's ours to write
It's our love and it’s our life
And right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline


Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Oh, storyline


We can pack for Paris, plan for Tennessee
Oceans, mountains, hey, I don't care as long as you're with me
Running like crazy, yeah, kissing in public
Who cares what the world thinks, girl
They don't know nothin' about us


You and I can fall as hard as we want
Make the story all our own and blow Shakespeare’s mind
It's ours to write
It's our love and it’s our life
And right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline



Yeah, hey, yeah


Mmm, let's make the story of our lives, whatever we wanna make it
If there's rules about the way this works
I think it's time that we break 'em
From the moment that I met you
Well, there's just one thing I've been prayin'
If this boy gets you, girl
Girl, would you take my name?


'Cause you and I can fall as hard as we want
Make the story all our own and blow Shakespeare’s mind
It's ours to write
It's our love and it’s our life
And right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline


I said, right or wrong, we'll write our own, storyline, yeah
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, hey, yeah, hey
It's all in our storyline, it's part of our storyline
It's all our, all in our storyline


People will tell you that this kind of love will fade
That being in love like this is only a phase
But baby, after all this time, ain't nothin' changed
All you gotta do is look at me that way


And there you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again


Oh, and I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
You only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again


Baby, sometimes you can say the craziest things
I love how you don't care what nobody thinks
You're highly original, totally in-typical, never change
All I gotta do is look at your smiling face


There you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again


Oh, and I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
You only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again


You're my sunshine, you're my rain
Sure feels good to know you feel the same


I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
Only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again


There you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go, there you go makin' me fall in love again


Makin' me fall in love again
(There you go, there you go)
Makin' me fall in love again
(There you go, there you go)
Makin' me fall in love again
(There you go, there you go)
Makin' me fall in love again


Somebody get me a guitar
Cause I got something to sing to you
Picked up a groove in my car
It's gonna get in the soles of your shoes
It ain't about a broken heart, did you wrong
Broken promise,leaving song
This ain't one of those nights
We've all had enough of those nights


It's time to sing about the good times
Come on let's rock it until the sun shines
Now that you got it don't you waste it
Oh can't you feel it, can't you taste it?
Oh yeah I really wanna put a smile on your lips
Like an eighth grade kiss, put a swing in your hips
Come on move like this
And sing about the good times, good times yeah


I need some crowd participation
I wanna see you going wall to wall
A revolution celebration
Until we're all shining like a disco ball
Somebody grab a mega-phone
Shout it out
Tell em' that we're all about
Leaving our worries behind
Come on and put your hand in mine


It's time to sing about the good times
Come on let's rock it until the sun shines
Now that you got it don't you waste it

I've been caught sideways out here on the crossroads
Trying to buy back the pieces I lost of my soul
It's hard when the devil won't get off your back
It's like carrying around the past in a hundred pound sack


Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah


Skeletons and ghosts are hiding in the shadows
Threatening me with all the things that they know
Choices and mistakes, they all know my name
But I'm through holding in and holding onto all that pain


Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah


I know I know I know I've been forgiven
I know I know I know I'm going to start living


Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away Yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah


Oh yeah


You are overbearing; I'm not in love
But I don't wanna tell you
We've been contemplating how to give it up
But I can't convince you
And we've been hopelessly holding too tight
When we don't even need to
And as the water fills this sinking ship
I know we have to leave too


Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm laying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday, yeah, yeah


Said I'm moving on, cause things were getting rough
But here I am in your bed
I strung it on too long, afraid to be alone
Now we're in over our heads
It's either sink or swim, we've tried so many times
For worse or for better
It tears my heart in two to leave it all behind
And say goodbye forever


Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm laying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday, yeah, yeah


Oh, you gotta let me leave
Oh, the weight will make us sink
Oh, could you please help me leave?
Oh, abandon ship with me


Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm laying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday


Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)


If you've got a little girl, you better take the time
To go to her tea parties and give her a piggyback ride
Be a dragon or a dinosaur every chance you get
Cause one day you can bet


She'll go on you
Before you turn can around
And it's so lonely watching that
Fast train leaving town
Better cherish her every second of your life
Cause this precious little thing that we call time
She'll go on you


If you got a special one
You better love her everyday
Leave her notes on the fridge rather door
And send her sweet bouquets
Always be her confidant
A safe place for her to rest
Or that little thing you call you happiness




If you've got you momma there
You outta thank her every day
For nursing all your colds and
Sitting' up when you'd stay out late
Now all her hair is grey, and every year she's not as strong
One of these days before to long




Yeah this precious little thing that we call life
She'll go on you


I don't want you to come 'round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
Cause when you say it's over with her
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in, knowing tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you


When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your blue eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no


I don't want you to call me up no more
Saying you need me
You're crazy if you think just half your love
Could ever please me
Still I want to hold you, touch you
When you look at me that way
There's only one solution I know
You got to stay away from me
Stay away from me!


When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your sad eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no
My heart can't tell you no!


I don't want you to come round here no more
I beg you for mercy
When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell
When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell
Living hell
When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell

A little longer, baby stay with me a little longer
I just want your touch again, to feel your body giving in
It’s pulling at me, my desire to make you happy
I want to feel your touch again

Let’s just lie here together chasing forever
I can’t get enough of your love
Brave and relentless, sweet and defenseless
I can never get enough, every time we touch

Can’t stop staring, my eyes keep taking off what you’re wearing
I just want your touch again, to feel your body giving in
You’re a bad liar, that smile gives away what you desire
You wanna feel my touch again

Let’s just lie here together, chasing forever
I can’t get enough of your love
Brave and relentless, sweet and defenseless
I can never get enough, every time we touch

Yeah, let’s lie here together chasing forever
I can’t get enough of your love
Brave and relentless, sweet and defenseless
I can never get enough, every time we touch
Every time we touch

Girl I know you don't really know me
Still I want you to listen closely
This might sound crazy
But after all isn't love like that
I would be crazy to let this moment pass

What if I don't say what's on my mind
And you walk away
I might live out my life
And never feel this way
What if you are the one
That I'm meant to love
What if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love
Don't come twice

Girl take a chance time is unfolding
We could be blessed without even knowing
Just for a minute
Close your eyes and don't take another breath
'Cause what if you miss it
And it never comes again

What if you don't say what's on your mind
And I walk away
You might live out your life
And never feel this way
What if I am the one
That you're meant to love
And what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love
Don't come twice

I don't wanna wake up by myself
Years from now wishin'
That I'd told you what I felt
Your eyes are a window to your soul
If you don't open up
I may never know

What if we don't say what's on our minds
And we walk away
We might live out our lives
And never feel this way
What if I am the one
And you are the one
What if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love
Don't come twice

Oh girl what if you are the one
And I am the one
What if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love
Don't come twice


Midnight's creepin' in, we know better
Than leaving here together
And in case you were wondering
You've never looked hotter
So why even bother
Looking at the reasons not to
Maybe we ought to


Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
And kiss a little more
Think a little less


When your friends start asking you
Look 'em in the eyes
Tell a white lie
How I dropped you off at home
And I walked you to the door
Nothing more
Tomorrow you can say we're just friends
But baby ‘til then
Kiss a little more


Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less


I'll go warm up the truck if you wanna hop in
Give you a minute or two
To say goodbye to your friends
Ain't gotta go home
But we gotta get gone
Cause we've already waited way too long to...


Kiss a little more
Think a little less
And do the only thing we've been thinking ‘bout doing
Since the moment, girl, we met


Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less


Yeah, think a little less
Yeah, think a little less


I feel like the
Flowers in this vase
He just brought them
Home one day
"Aren't they beautiful"
He said
They've been here in
The kitchen and the
Water's turning grey
They're sitting in
The vase but now
They're dead
Dead flowers

I feel like this
Long string of lights
They lit up our whole
House on Christmas day
But now it's January
And the bulbs have
All burned out
But still they hang
Like dead flowers


He isn't feeling anything
My love, my hurt, or the
Sting of this rain
I'm living in a hurricane
All he can say is
"Man isn't it such a nice day"
Yeah, Yeah


I feel like the
Tires on this car
They said we won’t go far
But we're still rolling
I look in the rear view
And I see dead flowers in the yard
And that string of lights
But and it isn't glowing
Like dead flowers
Like dead flowers


He isn't feeling anything
My love, my hurt, or the
Sting of this rain
I'm driving through a hurricane
All he can say is
"Man isn't it such a nice day"
Hey, hey I guess we'll just
Go to waste, like dead flowers


Like dead flowers
Dead flowers


That old foreign road, that’s where we go
We, we ain't got no VIP
No rope tied between these trees, pull on up and make yourself at home
Shit We, we ain't gotta play DJ, we got speakers and a Chevrolet
Rockin Randall Hank singing them new south songs. YEAH

Traffic crawls
Cell phone calls
Talk radio screams at me
Through my tinted window I see
A little girl
A rust red minivan
She's got chocolate on her face
Got little hands


And she waves at me
Yeah, she smiles at me


Well, hello world, how ya been?
Good to see you my old friend
Sometimes I feel, cold as steel
Broken like I'm never gon' to heal
I see a light, a little hope, in a little girl
Well, hello world


Every day I drive by
A little white church
It's got these little white crosses
Like angels in the yard
Maybe I should stop on in
Say a prayer
Maybe talk to God
Like he is there


Oh, I know he's there
Yeah, I know he's there


Well, hello world, how ya been?
Good to see you my old friend
Sometimes I feel, as cold as steel
And broken like I'm never gon' to heal
I see a light, a little grace, a little faith unfurl
Well, hello world


Sometimes I forget what living's for
And I hear my life through my front door
And I'll be there, oh, I'm home again
I see my wife, my little boy, little girl
Hello world
Hello world


All the empty disappears
I remember why I'm here
Just surrender and believe
I fall down on my knees
Oh, hello world
Hello world
Hello world


Like red on a rose
When your lips first smiled at me
I was captured instantly
To each his own
Like blue in the sky
The gaze of your willing eyes
Touched something deep inside
And the truth be known


That I love you
Like all little children love pennies
And I love you because I know that
I can't do anything wrong
You're where I belong
Like red on a rose


And I love you
Like all little children love pennies
And I love you
Like good times of which
I've known many
And I love you
Because I know you give me
A heart of my own
You make my blood flow
Like red on a rose


She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklins
She wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money
It's all how you treat her
She just want a friend to be there
When she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying


'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with the lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl


She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just want to feel that you're real
That she's near to the man that's inside
She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne
That she's more than amazing
She just wants you to say what you mean and to mean everything that you're saying


'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with a lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl


That's how you speak to, speak to her
That's how you speak to, speak to her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with a lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world


You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl


I remember saying I don't care either way
Just as long as he or she is healthy I'm OK
Then the doctor pointed to the corner of the screen
And said " you see that thing right there well you know what that means"
And I started wondering who he was going to be
And I thought heaven help us if he's anything like me
He'll probably climb a tree too tall and ride his bike too fast
End up every summer wearing something in a cast
He's going to throw a ball and break some glass in a window down the street


He's going to get in trouble oh he's going to get in fights
I'm going to lose my temper and some sleep
It safe to say that I'm going to get my payback if he's anything like me


I can see him right now knees all skinned up
With a magnifying glass trying to melt a Tonka truck
Won't he be a sight with his football helmet on
That'll be his first love till his first love comes along
He'll get his heart broke by the time he's in his teens
And heaven help him if he's anything like me
He'll probably stay out too late and drive his car too fast
Get a speeding ticket he'll pay for mowing grass
He's going to get caught skipping class and be grounded for a week




He's going to love me and hate me along the way
Years are going to fly by I already dread the day
He's going to hug his momma he's going to shake my hand
He's going to act like he can't wait to leave
But as he drives out he'll cry his eyes out
If he's anything like me
There's worse folks to be like
Aw, he'll be alright
If he's anything like me


In the early rush of morning
Trying to get the kids to school
One's hanging on my shirt-tail
Another's locked up in her room
And I'm yelling up the stairs
"Stop worrying about your hair, you look fine"
Then they're fighting in the backseat
And I'm playing referee
Now someone's got to go
The moment that we leave
And everybody's late
I swear that I can't wait until they grow up


Then they do, and that's how it is
It's just quiet in the morning
Can't believe how much you miss
All they do and all they did
You want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true
Then they do


Now the youngest is starting college
She'll be leaving in the Fall
And Brianna's latest boyfriend
Called to ask if we could talk
And I got the impression
That he's about to pop the question any day
I look over at their pictures
Sitting in their frames
I see them as babies
I guess that'll never change
You pray all their lives
That someday they will find happiness




No more Monday PTA's
No carpools, or soccer games
Your work is done
Now you've got time that's all your own
You've been waiting for so long
For those days to come




Ah, then they do


He was sittin' there, his brush in hand
Painting waves as they danced, upon the sand
With every stroke, he brought to life
The deep blue of the ocean, against the mornin' sky
I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes
He said for twenty dollars, I'll paint you anything


Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham


He looked at me, with knowing eyes
Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side
Picked up a brush, and said to me
Son, just where in this picture would you like to be
I said if there's any way you can
Could you paint me back into her arms again


Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham


Paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be, mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham


Oh, paint me a Birmingham

They used to make me go to church
Clip on tie, starch the shirt
I never heard the preacher's words
All slouched down in that pew
These days going to church is something I don't have to do
I get to

I used to have to hang with dad
Wash his car, and cut the grass
It took all day and I hated that
'Til his heart attack last June
These days helping dad is something I don't have to do
I get to
I, I get to

I get to wake up early
I get to go to work
I get to make an honest living to put my hands down in the dirt
I get hear grandma complain about all her little aches and pains
I get to rock my baby girl to sleep, spend my weekends coaching Little League
Theres a lot of things I don't have to do
I get to. Yes I do

I used to have to say those words
You always seemed to say them first
I dreamt one night you left this earth and I woke up and reached for you
Now I realize I don't have to say "I Love You."
I get to
Oh baby, I get to

I get to wake up early
I get to go to work
I get to make an honest living to put my hands down in the dirt
I get hear grandma complain about all her little aches and pains
I get to rock my baby girl to sleep, spend my weekends coaching Little League
Theres a lot of things I don't have to do
Oh theres a lot of things I don't have to do
I get to
I, I get to

I get to wake up early
And I get to go to work
There's a lot of things I don't have to do
I get to
I get rock my baby, and I get to help my dad
Theres a lot of things I don't have to do
I get to


You've been singing, that same old song
Far too long, far too long
Say you'll buy me a shiny ring
But your words don't mean a thing
No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy


Till you take me down (take me down)
You better take me down (take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down (take me down)
Take me down (take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down


You can't ride this gravy train
Anymore, anyway
There's a price for keeping me
I might be cheap, but I ain't free
No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy


Come on!


Charming devil, silver tongue
Had your fun, now you're done
Mama warned me 'bout your games
She don't like you anyways

No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy
No more chicken and gravy
Ain't gonna have your baby!



Take me down to the little white church, take me down
Take me down, take me down to the little white church
Take me down, take me down, take me down, take me down to the little white church
Take me down to the little white church, take me down to the little white church

When you give it up for gone
But your still diggin in the mine
And your starin out the window
Sayin everything will be just fine
Keepin with the whole affair
Every word seems outta line
No matter what angle you get
It's polish till it shine

Chorus:
So take a guess, where I stand
Pick a number, one to two
Take a look at the back of your hand
Just like ya know it, ya know me too

When ya say "Who the hell am I living with
What just went down?
Where did this come from, why are all my colors faded brown?
When did he change? What's with the rage?
Who's the dude with the extra role?
What's the verse, the line, the chapter, the page?"

Chorus

You think your lost without anyplace left to go
Like you need, one of those kisses, long and slow
First glance is not what it seems but theres some things that I just know
Like you take two sugars with a splash of cream

Chorus
Yeah, like ya know it, you know me too
Just like ya know it, ya know me too


In case you don't remember
I left a picture of us on the hood of your truck from that spring break
We were young and a little bit crazy enough to just think
We were gonna be something
Yeah weren't we something
A little bit burned, a little bit buzzed, didn't feel it
Still got the hat that you wore flip back, I wear it
Yeah I swear it


There was magic in the air
It was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
It was us against the world
And you swore girl that we'd never surrender
But I still can't forget you girl
In case you don't remember


I still got the key to the room that we never slept in
Yeah the love we made you let it fade away, well I kept it
And I don't regret it


There was magic in the air
It was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
It was us against the world
And you swore girl that we'd never surrender
But I still can't forget you girl
In case you don't remember


The last time we kissed
The taste of my lips
The way we couldn't say goodbye


There was magic in the air
It was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
There was something in the way that you swore girl
That we'd never surrender but I still can't forget you girl
No I won't ever forget you girl
In case you don't remember


I left a picture of us on the hood of your truck from that spring break

WYNONNA
What The World Needs Now Is Love
What The World Needs
I look around at all the faces and I see
All the lonely people looking back at me
Rich, poor don't matter we're all the same
Everybody's hungry in a different way
We're clawin' and climbin' and kickin' and screamin' and fightin' but really


What the world needs now is love
Love and only love
A little help from up above
Faith to make a better day
Let's come together
Lay our differences down
Spread it all around
That's what the world needs now
(La, la, la, la, la)
Sometimes all it takes is just a smile
To change somebody's weather
Chase the clouds out of their sky
Sometimes you gotta give and not receive
Sometimes you gotta live what you believe
Open your arms cause that's where it starts
Right here with you and with me




Nobody likes the cold
We all need someone to hold
No one wants to be alone


( "Let's come together, lay our prejudices down...")
(La, la, la, la, la)


Saw your picture in the Sunday paper
Bet your momma sure is proud
She finally found you a real straight lacer
All your dreams are really getting buttoned down

But girl you know that I know you too well
Before you cut the cake before you ring that bell

I'll be around around about the time you're wishing
For a Friday evening with the rag top down
I'll be around around like a second hand ticking
In the nick of time I can make you mine
If you long to feel the wind in your hair
And the choices seem a little too square
I'll be around, around, around
I'll be around, around, around

Girl you never did like vanilla
You were more of the rocky road kind
Hates princes and Cinderella's
Gravitated to Bonnies and Clydes

Girl you know I'm happy if this is it
But if you ever find that the shoes don't fit

I'll be around around about the time you're wishing
For a Friday evening with the rag top down
I'll be around around like a second hand ticking
In the nick of time I can make you mine
If you long to feel the wind in your hair
And the choices seem a little too square
I'll be around, around, around
I'll be around, around, around

But girl you know that I know you too well
Before you cut the cake before you ring that bell

I'll be around around about the time you're wishing
For a Friday evening with the rag top down
I'll be around around like a second hand ticking
In the nick of time I can make you mine
If you long to feel the wind in your hair
And the choices seem a little too square
I'll be around, around, around
I'll be around, around, around

I'll be around

The look in your eyes
When you left here that night
Was like somebody'd stolen your soul
The trance you were in
Made me crawl in my skin
You were under some outer control
But I won't give up hopin'
The spell can be broken

CHORUS
When you come around
To your own good sence
When you break the chains and you're free again
I'll be waiting here to take you in
When you come around
If it takes a day or a hundred years
Me and my heart are gonna be right here
To pick love up where we put it down
When you come around

The moon can't see out from behind the winter clouds
Don't know how you could find your way home
So I'll stay up all night
Like I do every night
To make sure that the porch light stays on
The winds may be blowin'
But these arms will be open

CHORUS

If it takes a day or a hundred years
Me and my heart are gonna be right here
To pick love up where we put it down
When you come around

When you come around
When you come around


Bye bye baby I'm leaving
You can keep your mansion and your money
Your boat and your Benz and your uptown friends
And your country club that ain't really country
I need a little down home lovin'
And a man ain't gonna get it up here
Yeah I'll find what I want in a honky tonk
I like girls that drink beer


You bought me a black tie suit and I ain't wearin' it
Can't be seen in that thing in my Lariat
Ain't goin' down to the ball in your chariot
This high rise life just ain't for me


Bye bye baby I'm leaving
You can keep your mansion and your money
Your boat and your Benz and your uptown friends
And your country club that ain't really country
I need a little down home lovin'
And a man ain't gonna get it up here
Yeah I'll find what I want in a honky tonk
I like girls that drink beer


There's a two lane black top road and I'm a-hittin' it
Skynard back son, let her fly just a-gettin' it
Find me a little hot spot and just sit in it
Give me a mug of that ice cold brew
Get me a girl that's got one too


Bye bye baby I'm leaving
You can keep your mansion and your money
Your boat and your Benz and your uptown friends
And your country club that ain't really country
I need a little down home lovin'
And a man ain't gonna get it up here
Yeah I'll find what I want in a honky tonk
I like girls that drink beer




Hey I need a little down home lovin'
And a man ain't gonna get it up here
Hey I'll find what I want in a honky tonk
I like girls that drink beer
Yeah I'll find what I want in a honky tonk
I like girls that drink beer


Dancin' in the kitchen, you singing my favorite songs
Swinging on the front porch, just laughing at the dogs
How you swear you love me more
When you're whisperin' goodnight
All those little moments are every reason why


I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm homesick for you


Well it says Kane Brown
On a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town
I've never been before
Yeah, they're screamin' my name
This is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' about you, baby, all I think about


Is how I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the morning
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you


Homesick for you
Yeah, yeah


I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes, just tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you
I'm homesick for you
Yeah, yeah


Fast, on a rough road riding
High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home
Young, like a new moon rising
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown
And I don't want no one to cry
But, tell them if I don't survive


I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free


Free, like a river raging
Strong as the wind I’m facing
Chasing dreams and racing father time
Deep like the grandest canyon
Wild like an untamed stallion
If you can’t see my heart you must be blind
You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can’t keep no chains on me


I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free


And I'm not good at long goodbyes
But look down deep into my eyes
I was born free
Calm, facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets
Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waiting patiently for the sun to set
And when it's done, believe that I
Will yell it from that mountain high


I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free


I will bow to the shining sea
And celebrate God's grace on thee


Well here you come again and you're looking so fine
You don't notice me but it's alright
I'm just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words, it's true
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you
I want to put you in a melody, I got to set you into a groove


I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl oh
If I could press play, repeat how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song, oh oh oh


Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight
It'd be so easy, I'd just write it from my heart
Because I got to tell the world what you mean to me
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be
Stuck in my head all day
Because you're already there anyway, yes you are


I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl
If I could press play, repeat how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song


And if I get it right everybody will be singing along yeah
And when they see you on the street they'll say
Hey aren't you the girl in that song




I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I'm in love with this girl
Yeah if I could press play, rewind a couple million times
Imagine for a moment that you're all mine
Every night I'd drive you home
If I could put you in a
Let me put you in a song
Let me put you in a song
Oh a pretty little song about you baby



Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel your watching in the night
All alone with me
And waiting for the sunlight

When I feel cold you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on
You come and hold me
It's you and me forever

Sara smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara?

If you feel like leaving, you know you can go
(You know you can go)
Why don't you stay until tomorrow?
If you want to be free
You know all you've got to do is say so

When you feel cold I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on
I'll come and hold you
It's you and me forever

Sara smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara?
Sara smile
Oh, won't you smile a while for me? Sara, please
Sara, Sara, smile
Smile

Yeah, smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara?
(Sara, Sara, smile)
Come on, you know how that makes me feel
You know how that makes me feel, to see you smile
Sara, Sara, Sara


If I could kill a word and watch it die
I'd poison "never," shoot goodbye
Beat "regret" when I felt I had the nerve
Yeah, I'd pound "fear" to a pile of sand
Choke "lonely" out with my bare hands
I'd hang "hate" so that it can't be heard
If I could only kill a word


I'd take "brokeness" out back
And break "heartbreak," stand there and laugh
Right in its face while shootin' it the bird
I'd put "upset" down in its place
I'd squeeze the life out of "disgrace"
Lay "over" under six cold feet of dirt
If I could only kill a word


Give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn "lies" and "hate" to "love" and "truth"
If I could only kill a word


I'd knock out "temptation"'s teeth
I'd sever "evil," let it bleed
Then light up "wicked," stand and watch it burn
I'd take "vice" and I'd take "vile"
Tie 'em up there with "hostile"
Hang 'em high and leave 'em for the birds
If I could only kill a word


So give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn "lies" and "hate" to "love" and "truth"
If I could only kill a word
If I could only kill a word


Hope is an anchor
And love is a ship
Time is the ocean
And life is a trip
You don't know where you're going
Till you know where your at
And if you can't read the stars
Well, you'd better have a map
A compus and a conscious
So you don't get lost at sea
Lonesome old lonely island
Where no one wants to be


From the beginning of creation
I think our maker had a plan
For us to leave these shores
And sail beyond the sand
And let the good light guide us
To the waves and the wind
To the beaches in a world
Where we've have never been
And we'll climb up on the mountain y'all
We'll let our voices ring
And those who've never tried it
They'll be the first to sing


Oh, my, my
I'll see you on the other side
If I make it
And it might be a long hard ride
But I'm gonna take it
Sometime it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
The streets are gold 'cause you'll be there
Oh, my, my


You don't bring nothin' with you here
And you can't take nothin' back
I ain't never seen a hearse with a luggage rack
So I've torn my knees a-prayin'
Scared my back from falling down
Spent so much time flying high
Till I'm face first in the ground
So if you're up there watching me
Would you talk to God and say
Tell him I might need a hand
To see you both someday


Oh, my, my
So, I'll see you on the other side
If I make it
And it may be a long hard ride
But I want to take it
Sometime it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold
'Cause you'll be there (you'll be there)
Oh, my, my
'Cause you'll be there (you'll be there)
Oh, my, my


Just cause I don't wake up with a bottle
And my blood don't know the fire of cocaine
Just cause my skin don't know the sting of a needle
That don't mean that I don't know the pain


Cause I've taken hits, woke up hungover
Gone on benders, stone cold sober
Slammed the door right off the hinges
Hotel rooms and midnight binges
Wrecked my life, had too much
Of things I swore I'd never touch
So don't tell me I've never done the hard stuff
Cause I've done love
I've done love


I don't get my fix in some back alley
My tongue still knows the taste of ecstasy
We're all on the road to chasing happy
But it ain't a thrill inside a pill that makes a junkie out of me


Cause I've taken hits, woke up hungover
Gone on benders, stone cold sober
Slammed the door right off the hinges
Hotel rooms and midnight binges
Wrecked my life, had too much
Of things I swore I'd never touch
So don't tell me I've never done the hard stuff
Cause I've done love
Yeah I've done love


Love, love what I need
Up so high but on my knees
In the dark and on the street
I've done love, or has it done me?
Love, love, what I need
Up so high but on my knees
In the dark and on the street
I've done love, or has it done me?


I've taken hits, woke up hungover
On a bender, stone cold sober
Slammed the door right off the hinges
Hotel rooms and midnight binges
I touched the sky, I had it all
I had too much, I had withdrawal
So don't tell me I've never done the hard stuff
Cause I've done love
I've done love


Love, love what I need
Up so high but on my knees
In the dark and on the street
I've done love, or has it done me?

At the end of my life, when I take that journey all alone
And I’m on my own and there’s no one there to save me
Oh, when I look back at all the things that I’ve done wrong
You know I wasn’t always strong
Lord will you take me cause I been down as far as a man can go
I wanna be ready when I hear that whistle blow

And I’m on the last train running and the devil’s coming
Hoping that my good outweighs the bad
And I’m heading for the station the final destination
Praying for the lord to take my hand
And I’m on the last train running

When I close my eyes and I’m holding on to my last breath
I don’t want my regrets to coming back to haunt me
When it’s far too late to ask forgiveness for my sins
I hope my enemies and friends can both forgive me

Will there be tears for me when I go
Or will I be just another name carved in a stone

When I’m on the last train running and the devil’s coming
Doing all he can to take my soul
And I’m heading for the station the final destination
Praying for the Lord to take me home
And I’m on the last train running
I’m on the last train running

You only get one shot
One chance against the clock
And you only get one life
One chance to make it right

When I’m on the last train running and the devil’s coming
Doing all he can to take my soul
Oh, Lord, won’t you come and take me home
On the last train running
When I’m on the last, on the last train
When I’m on the last train running


And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, finding things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this


'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight


It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah


I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby


Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
Shinin' off the cross hangin' from the mirror of my ride
Breeze blowin' in, your hair blowin' round
You're scanning through the stations lookin' for that country sound
The good stuff iced up in the back seat
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be


I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it


Nothing but two lane country on up ahead
Girl you so fine, I wouldn't mind if this is all we did
You got me high on kisses
You got me missin' signs
Hard lookin' left when my world is on my right


I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it


Nothing like a little you and me low key
Right now I'm right where I wanna be


I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it


Yeah I love rockin' with you and girl
We're just chillin' it

When all the bright lights have shut down
And they have closed every door in town
I'll be around

When there is nobody left to call
And you're surrounded by these walls
I'll make them fall
I'll make them fall

Aaahhh, aaaah
Aaahhh, aaaah

When all the money has been spent
And you've thrown away every cent
I'll take you in

When you are driftin' off to sleep
Maybe tonight in your dreams
Consider me
Consider me

Aaahhh, Aaaah
Aaaah, Aaaah

Aaahhh, Aaaah (Aaaah)
Aaahhh, Aaaah (Aaaah)
Aaahhh, Aaaah (Aaaah)
Aaahhh, Aaaah (Aaaah)
Aaahhh, Aaaah (Aaaah)


Remember, boys, never let a lady open the door
And be there with a lighter if she wants a smoke
Remember, boys, never let her go to sleep crying
When she tells you 'bout her dreams
You gotta fill 'em up with hope


'Cause I don't wanna be a one night boy
I don't wanna be an ain't right boy
I don't wanna be a "had a ball, wait it out, no call" kinda love song boy
I don't wanna be a regret or the one that she forgets
I don't wanna be a June to September
I wanna be one of those remember boys


Remember, boys, always open her beer first
And tell her that you love her even when she makes you mad
And remember, boys, no matter what, you make it work
You want her and need her and fight to keep her
Let her know you know what you have


I don't wanna be a one night boy
I don't wanna be an ain't right boy
I don't wanna be a "had a ball, wait it out, no call" kinda love song boy
I don't wanna be a regret or the one that she forgets
I don't wanna be a June to September
I wanna be one of those remember boys


No, I don't wanna be a late night boy
I don't wanna be a heartbreak boy
I don't wanna be a can't trust him with your love kind of loser boy
I don't wanna be a regret or the one that she forgets
I don't wanna be a June to September
I wanna be one of those remember boys
That's right
I wanna be one of those remember boys

Sometimes I go walking through the long tall grass
Wonder how long hard times will last
For this backward soul on a road that god knows where
As hard as I try ain't left no track
It's not enough to find my way back
I hit the ground like broken glass and just lay there

Chorus
Singing why me, oh why me
And I throw another empty bottle up against the wall
And I say why me, oh why me
But pitty never ever did me any kinda good at all
So I walk on

Verse II
And I wound up on the capital steps
Watching the lobbyists smoking cigarettes
And bury their shoes in the country club blues
And who got who by the short hairs

Standing there in their high dollar suits
Looking down at my tattered old jeans and boots
And this weathered guitar that seems to follow me everywhere
God it follows me everywhere

Chorus
Playing why me, oh why me
All I got's another song about how money makes and breaks the law
And I sing why me, oh why me
I'm just a broke troubadore with a bark for the underdog
So I walk on

Verse III
Now I ain't Jesus, but I can relate
To a man looking death square in the face
Even he hit his knees with a plea in the garden of gethsemane
To his holy father he raised his eyes
In his darkest hours he cried
Please would you take this cup from me

Chorus
Praying why me, oh why me
Knowing all the while he had to carry that cross and hang there
When I say why me, oh me
I know that somewhere up in heaven there's a big old book with my name there
So I walk on, I rock on
Even when I'm singing, why me, I rock on
Even when I'm singing, why me, I rock on
Even when I'm singing, why me


I'm booking myself a one-way flight
I gotta see the color in your eyes
And telling myself I'm gonna be alright
Without you, baby, is a waste of time


Yeah, our first date, girl, the seasons changed
It got washed away in a summer rain
You can't undo a fall like this
'Cause love don't know what distance is
Yeah, I know it's crazy


But I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep, can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about?
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy
Are you with me, baby? Let's be crazy
Yeah


Well, I wanna be scared, don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good, don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does
I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catching up calls and a date sometimes
I love that we're rebels and we still believe
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be, yeah
Uh, I know we're crazy, yeah


But I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep, can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about?
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy
Are you with me, baby? Let's be crazy



Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na


No, I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep, can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about?
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy


Yeah, look at us, baby
Tonight the midnight rules are breaking
There's no such thing as wild enough
Maybe we just think too much
Who needs to play it safe in love?
Let's be crazy


Who cares if we're crazy
We gotta be crazy
I know that we're crazy
So let's be crazy
Yeah, yeah

Working all week could make a grown man cry
But nobody's sad on a Saturday night
So throw some cheap sun glasses on your blood shot eyes
'Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night

Some Johnny Cougar, some Southern Comfort
Winners and losers, we got each other
The world looks better in neon lights
'Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night, that's right

Tell me your story and I'll tell you mine
Nobody's sad on a Saturday night
I'll leave out the part where she said goodbye
'Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night

They go, whoa whoa, here we go, rock 'n' roll rodeo

Some Johnny Cougar, some Southern Comfort
Winners and losers, we got each other
The world looks better in neon lights
'Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night

They go, whoa whoa, here we go, rock 'n' roll rodeo

Some Johnny Cougar, some Southern Comfort
Winners and losers, we got each other
The world looks better in neon lights
'Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night

Some Hank Jr., some Southern Comfort
I see you dancing, babe, I got your number
The world looks better in neon lights
'Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night


The smile, the charm, the words, the spark, everything, you had it
Guess I had a naive heart, 'cause boy I let you have it
You said I was your only, never thought you'd leave me lonely


You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground


Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place
As Neverland, you don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan


Deep down, I knew that you were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you
Now it's happily ever never, I guess now I know better


You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground


Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place
As Neverland, you don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan


You're just a lost boy, yeah, I know who you are
And you don't know what you lost, boy, too busy chasing stars


And you're always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place
As Neverland, you don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
You're never grow up, yeah
You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan
Never gonna be a man


I heard you've been wondering
How I'm getting along
I guess you think I can't make it with you gone
But I don't want you to worry
Don't you lose any sleep
But a man called long-distance this morning
Said they're thinking about putting me


On the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim
In the USA Today


I don't sleep in the nighttime
Darkness reminds me of you
I lost eight pounds since last Tuesday
But I could stand to lose a few
I don't believe I'm too bad
People say I look fine
The man from the paper seems happy
Says I'm bigger than the latest crime




So if you're concerned in trouble
Then you're hurting me
Don't you work out this little thing called losing you
Has made a big man out of me




Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wandering around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you've got it all together
So if you don't mind, I'd like to know you better


Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around


I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in Clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive


Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around


Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been


Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want your red blushing stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around

Talkin' that sweet talk, so sincere
Sayin' everything that I wanna hear
An' I wanna believe, yeah, yeah
I wanna believe

You're a silver-tongued devil an' a sly Don Juan
You're doin' me right while you're a-doin' me wrong
Still I wanna believe, Lord, Lord
I wanna believe

My woman's intuition
Is arousin' my suspicion
I'm in a dangerous position
That I'd just like to see
You know just how much I wanna believe

Heard a conversation in the check-out line
They mentiuoned your name 'bout three or four times
I didn't wanna believe, no;
Didn't wanna believe

Then out in the parkin' lot, we made friends
You been doin' to me what you been doin' to them
I didn't wanna believe, no, no;
Didn't wanna believe

My woman's intuition
Is arousin' my suspicion
I'm in a dangerous position
That I'd just like to see
You know just how much I wanna believe

Your lips are movin' so I know you're alive
You know I know you, but you keep on tryin'
An' I wanna believe, yeah, yeah
I wanna believe

Talkin' that sweet talk, so sincere
Sayin' everything that I wanna hear
An' I wanna believe, yeah
I wanna believe

Lord, I wanna believe you, baby
I wanna believe

Lord, Lord, I wanna believe


In your arms
I can still feel the way you want me when you hold me
I can still hear the words you whispered when you told me
I can stay right here forever in your arms


And there ain't no way
I'm letting you go now
And there ain't no way
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day


'Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
Always
Mmmm, baby


In your heart
I can still hear a beat for every time you kiss me
And when we're apart I know how much you miss me
I can feel your love for me in your heart


And there ain't no way (ain't no way)
I'm letting you go now
And there ain't no way (ain't no way)
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day


'Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
Always


Oh
Yeah
Wanna wake up every morning
Oh


In your eyes (I can still see the look of the one)
I can still see the look of the one who really loves me
(I can still feel the way that you want)
The one who wouldn't put anything Else in the world above me
(I can still see love for me) I can still see love for me in your eyes
(I still see the love)


And there ain't no way (ain't no way)
I'm letting you go now
And there ain't no way (ain't no way)
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day


'Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
I'm keeping you forever and for always


Oh
I'm keeping you forever
Got to keep you, baby
Forever
In your arms


What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made


I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe?


You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe


What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe


I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
We said, "No one else", how could you do this, babe?


You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time


Since you admitted it, I keep picturin'
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you
Babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?


You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe


How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said I'm no one else, we ain't gettin' through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
This is the last time, this is the last time
You said no one else, this is the last time
I'll never call you babe


Well I smoke and I fish
But not near enough to satisfy an itch
Of a girl, understand
I need something to do with my hands


I don't work, on a car
And I'm as bad at pool as I am at throwin' darts
And golf, not a fan
But I need something to do with my hands


So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands


I can play you a song
On this old guitar, if it turns you on
If you want, we could dance
But I need something to do with my hands


So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands


Top off, in my jeep
And we can go for a ride and I could drive with my knees
I'll behave, best I can
But I need something to do with my hands


So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am

Yeah maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands
I need something to do with my hands
With my hands
Something to do with my hands


Honey, load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home


And choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say, is...


Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away


Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more


Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave


Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away


Aww, fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Fire away
Aww, fire away
Fire away

When the rain runs down your window
And you can't hold back your tears
And you're so afraid to be alone
You know I'm always right here

You cry lonely
And I come runnin'
I come to your rescue; I'll chase your blues away
You cry lonely, but you don't really want me
And I won't be there one of these days

You always say your heart is breakin'
Then you hear the wolf outside your door
I know you, you just use me
Till you don't need me anymore

You cry lonely
And I come runnin'
I come to your rescue; I'll chase your blues away
You cry lonely, but you don't really want me
And I won't be there one of these days

Someday when you know you really love me
You're gonna cry my name
And I'll be gone

You cry lonely
And I come runnin'
I come to your rescue; I'll chase your blues away
You cry lonely, but you don't really want me
And I won't be there one of these days

I won't be there
When you cry my name
I won't be there
When you cry my name


I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days


And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah


Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well


Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Well take a look at what's left in that sunset
Fireflies popping like the Fourth of July, yeah
You're gonna wanna see every single thing I'm gonna show you tonight
Got the perfect scene set of a moonlight glowing
Just keep them baby blues wide open
Girl take a look around, yeah it's going down
It's going down just right

Hey baby fore the night gets any older
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer
I need to hold ya
I wanna show ya what you don't wanna miss, no
It's all getting to what we've been waiting on
I'm gonna go and turn you and the night on
Coming on strong, I'm gonna lay it on your lips
Might wanna close your eyes for this

Sun gone down, nights are getting hotter
We've got this bed backed up to the water
Yeah it's the place to be if you wanna see every little shining star
But that view ain't nothing like the you I'm lookin at
Two tan legs for days dangling off the back
It all looks better baby you can see forever when you're here in my arms

Hey baby fore the night gets any older
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer
I need to hold ya
I wanna show ya what you don't wanna miss, no
It's all getting to what we've been waiting on
I'm gonna go and turn you and the night on
Coming on strong, I'm gonna lay it on your lips
Might wanna close your eyes for this

Just when you thought you had seen it all
Well it turns out you don't have to see it all

Hey baby fore the night gets any older
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer
I need to hold ya
I wanna show ya what you don't wanna miss, no
It's all getting to what we've been waiting on
I'm gonna go and turn you and the night on
Coming on strong, I'm gonna lay it on your lips
Might wanna close your eyes for this
Might wanna close your eyes for this
Hey pretty girl might wanna close your eyes for this
Close your eyes for this


Tell me now if you came sneaking up behind
Would you know me and see behind the smile
I can change like colors on a wall
Hoping no one else will find what lies beneath it all
I think I hide it all so well


Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows


Looking through the crowd
I search for something else
But every time I turn around
I run into myself
Here I stand
Consumed with my surroundings
Just another day
Of everybody looking
I swore they'd never see me cry
You'll never see me cry


Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows


You say I'll pay the price
That's the chance that I'll take
Though you may think I'm telling lies
But I just call it getting by


Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows

She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again

She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
And I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by like a fast train
Nothin' else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question much to my surprise

She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
And I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

So I called the preacher, family, and friends
And nothin's been the same since

She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

She said yes

On that very first day, the Lord sat down
And saw fit to say “let there be light!”
So He can tell the day time from the night
And then He spoke again and felt the wind
Come rolling in, smelt the rain
It soaked everything

Then the mountains rose up
Across the great planes
And all the angels up in Heaven started singing
“all it’s missing is a pretty thing”

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man... Lordy
Something you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang
The heart beat of the heartland
She’s got a drawl yall, yeah
She’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls, come on

He met me back in ’68
The first time I met her I was nearly eight
And she was ten
Her name was little Kay Lynn
She was born to a farmer who was friends with my father
I was in love with a sharecropper's only daughter
Thought I was in, it made me think again

But when I turned 16
I thought it couldn’t get worse
I saw her riding on a horse and fell in love so bad it hurt

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man
Something you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang
The heart beat of the heartland
She’s got a drawl yall, yeah
She’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls, come on

Let there be cowgirls

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man
Something you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang
The heart beat of the heartland
She’s got a drawl yall, yeah
She’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls, come on




I know I just met you (met you)
Been talking your ears off (ears off)
But I wanna know everything (everything)
And I got all night long (all night long)
Are you tryna be someone for someone?
'Cause you remind me of where I come from
So boy, I know it's kinda soon (know it's kinda soon)
But I'll tell you what I wanna do


I wanna take you home
And I ain't talkin' about a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain’t the same old song about two hearts hooking up
One and done, on a Friday
Naw boy, I’m talking about a map-dot town, nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do and why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home


Daddy's gonna love you (love you)
He'll probably talk your ears off (ears off)
Drive you by the little church (little church)
That saved me when I got lost
Take you down roads that I grew up on
Wish on those stars that I used to wish on
Kiss you on the bleachers on the 50-yard line (50-yard line)
Boy, you know I...


I wanna take you home
And I ain't talkin' about a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old...
Oh, this ain’t the same old song about two hearts hooking up
One and done, on a Friday
Naw boy, I’m talking about a map-dot town, nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do and why I'm fallin' for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home


Oh, I ain’t tryna jump the gun
Sure ain’t tryna make run
But the second I saw you, I knew I had to get you alone


I wanna take you home
And I ain't talkin' about a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old...
Oh, this ain’t the same old song about two hearts hooking up
One and done, on a Friday
Naw boy, I’m talking about a map-dot town, nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do and why I'm fallin' for you
And why I take it slow

Yeah, I wanna take you home


And tell you about me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm fallin' for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home

There's a half dressed mama running through the front yard
Waving a briefcase a hollerin'
There's mailman stumbling to his truck
With a dog on his leg that sure could use a collar and
I know there's times that you
Wish you had my point of view

I can see two skin-kneed boys
Down at the creek
Smoking daddy's cigarette butts
Down there's a man cussing me
Cuz he just got his car all washed and waxed up
But I ain't done nothing wrong
I'm just a bird singing my song

Looking down on the world below
Here they come and there they go
I'm a people watcher it's been a hobby of mine
For quite some time
And I might go out on a limb
Just to get a better look at them
Oh no, I'm a little too close
I better fly away

There's a See Rock City birdhouse
Where I like to hang out but Johnny Shoots BBs
And Mrs.Cole's got a cement bowl
Where I'd love to take a bath
But the cat might eat me
So I'll just stay up here
At least until the coast is clear

Chorus

Oh Yeah

There's a millions stories that I could tell
But some of them I keep to myself
Just remember whatever you do
Somebody looking over you, yeah

La La La La La La La La La La

Chorus

La La La La La La La La La La


City side walks, busy side walks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And in every corner you'll hear


Silver Bells
Silver Bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day


Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big seen
And above all the bustle you'll hear


Silver Bells
Silver Bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Soon it will be Christmas day


Christmas day
Silver bells
Silver bells
Silver bells


Here you come knocking on my door baby
Tell me what you got on your mind
I guess those college boys all went home for the summertime
And you’re looking right, looking good, looking like a woman should
So why is it so hard to find
A place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while


You run on a little tough luck baby
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
Come and get it


Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your friend?
And who’s the one guy that you come running to
When your love life starts tumbling?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let’s cut a deal let’s make a plan
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?


You might’ve run on a little tough luck baby
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
So come and get it


Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?


There's a little moonlight, dancing on the sand
There's a warm breeze blowing by the ocean as you're taking my hand
You need to know where I'm standing now
That I'm right on the edge of giving in to ya
Baby it's a long way down


If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're going to treat it right?
I'm barely hanging on
If I fall, can you let me down easy?


The scent of your perfume, floating in the air
Looking like an angel, lying on a blanket with a halo of hair
And those lips, look to good to be true
Once I taste that kiss, I know what'll happen
I'll be at the mercy of you


If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're going to treat it right?
I'm barely hanging on
If I fall, can you let me down easy?

If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're going to treat it right?
I'm barely hanging on
If I fall, can you let me down easy?


Let me down easy babe
Mmmm

Look at her with you
Her eyes are shining she lookes brand new
Last time i saw her she was falling apart
She was crying at the fleetwood fair
Now shes laughing and tossing her hair
Cause she loves you like i never broke her heart

Like i never said goodbye
Never made her cry
Never told a lie, crossed the line or pushed too hard
I never slammed the door
Or made her walk the floor
I wonder where i went when i went too far
She loves you like i never broke her heart

At the time i didn't know
Just what i had til she let go
Of me and fell right into your arms
So ill turn away if she looks at me
Ive done enough shes finally free
Yes she loves you like i never broke her heart

Like i never said goodbye
Never made her cry
Never told a lie, crossed the line or pushed too hard
I never slammed the door
Or made her walk the floor
I wonder where i went when i went too far
She loves you like i never broke her heart

Ive never seen her look better than she looks tonight
I dont know what you do but youre doing something right

Like i never said goodbye
Never made her cry
Never told a lie, crossed the line or pushed too hard
I never slammed the door
Or made her walk the floor
I wonder where i went when i went too far
She loves you like i never broke her heart

Saw her somewhere the other day
But she just smiled and looked away
Like i never broke her heart


When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
And whispered in my ear, guess who
I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you

And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast


And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
That's right
You look good in my shirt


Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on


And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt


Come on now
Aww, that's right
Oh, you look so fine
Eh, yeah


And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt


One, two, three, four
You look good in my shirt
Yeah, yeah
(Come on, now)


Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, I'm not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes


This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking about
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it


Girl I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee


This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking about
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it


Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile


This is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking about
Looking out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is it


Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man
But you can do the job when you're in town"
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down!
When it snows
Ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland


We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Rocking the sugar winterland
Walking in the winter wonderland

Is it obvious to you
When you walk into a room
Your face is all I see?
And my heart races so fast
I never knew a rush to feel like that
Every time you're touching me
I never did believe in anything
I couldn't hold between my fingers
But the way you make me feel
It's just so real the way it lingers
I get lost inside your stare
Lost when you're not there
When everything I have doesn't mean a thing
If it's without you
If it's a dream, don't wake me up
I'll scream if this isn't love
If bein' lost means never knowin'
How it feels without you
I wanna stay lost forever
I wanna stay lost forever with you
No, this feeling doesn't end
It's with me everywhere I am
Hope it never goes away
It's like defying gravity
Losin' all control and bein' free
And I always wanna stay
I never thought that I'd let go
Long enough to fall for someone deeply
Who had the power to erase my fears
And find me so completely
I get lost inside your stare
Lost when you're not there
When everything I have doesn't mean a thing
If it's without you
If it's a dream, don't wake me up
I'll scream if this isn't love
If bein' lost means never knowin'
How it feels without you
I wanna stay lost
Don't tell me where we're goin'
I don't wanna know
I like the mystery
I can't believe we've come this far
So far away from where we started off
You found me when I wasn't lookin'
You found me
And now I'm lost inside your stare
Lost when you're not there
And everything I have doesn't mean a thing
If it's without you, without you
If it's a dream, don't wake me up
I'll scream if this isn't love
If bein' lost means never knowin'
How it feels without you
Yeah, if bein' lost means never knowin'
How it feels without you
Oh, if bein' lost means that I'm never
Gonna be without you
I wanna stay lost forever
I wanna stay lost forever with you

It's a big job just gettin' by with nine kids and a wife
I been a workin' man dang near all my life
I'll be working long as my two hands are fit to use
I'll drink my beer in a tavern
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

I keep my nose on the grindstone, I work hard every day
Might get a little tired on the weekend, after I draw my pay
But I'll go back workin, come Monday morning I'm right back with the crew
I'll drink a little beer that evening
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

Hey hey, the working man, the working man like me
I ain't never been on welfare, that's one place I won't be
Cause I'll be working long as my two hands are fit to use
I drink a little beer that evening
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

Sometimes I think about leaving, do a little bummin around
I wanna throw my bills out the window catch a train to another town
But I go back working I gotta buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes
Yeah drink a little beer that evening
Cry a little bit of these working man blues

Hey hey, the working man, the working man like me
I ain't never been on welfare, that's one place I won't be
Cause I'll be working long as my two hands are fit to use
I drink a little beer that evening
Sing a little bit of these working man blues
Yeah drink a little beer that evening
Cry a little bit of these working man blues


Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around
Moonshine, that's where they make it
Put it in a jug, makes you want to get naked
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip


I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl


Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willing and able
Don't know what makes you say what the hell
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something about it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance


I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl


Well I remember back home beneath the big old moon
Tucked back in the woods, yeah life was good
But here we are in a local bar and drinking shooting stars


I might spend my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl


If you could read my mind, you might slap my face
If you could see inside my heart, you'd see it's in the right place
See, it's like bunnies in a Bramble, or honey bees in a hive
Whenever I'm beside you, that's my paradise
Might be a twisted way of sayin', I ain't proud, an' no offence
But I been thinkin' 'bout you, baby, in the future tense


We'll take it slower than a broke-knee'd turtle
Yeah, we'll get tighter than your grandma's girdle
Oh, I want you, I need you, an' I'll never do you wrong
If you're feelin' what I'm singin', baby: sing along


Ain't no moonshine maker, ain't no man of the cloth
Ain't no kangaroo lawyer, but I will get you off
Because anything worth doin's worth doin' again
An' again, an' again, an' when




I want you, I need you, an' I'll never do you wrong
If you're diggin' what I'm singin', baby: just jump on in an' sing along
Slower than a broke-knee'd turtle
Tighter than your grandma's girdle




Don't say a word:
Mmm sing like a bird
Don't say a word:
Yeah, sing like a bird
Slower than a broke-knee'd
Tighter than your grandma's
Yeah

I met a girl from Johnson City, man:
She's about the prettiest thing in the state
So I went down to the DMV
Was gonna get me some vanity plates

I told 'em: "She's my everything; she's my dream come true:
"If I don't tell her, man, I don't what I'll do
"It feels so good that I can't keep it to myself
"I love that T E, double-N, E double-S double-E G I R L."

So I called up Dave, formerly a jet-fighter;
Currently a sky-writer, when you pay him cash
I told him what I wanted him to give me:
He said: "I'll get so dizzy, I'll prob'ly crash."

I told him: "She's my everything; she's my dream come true:
"If I don't tell her, man, I don't what I'll do
"It feels so good that I can't keep it to myself
"I love that T E, double-N, E double-S double-E G I R L."

(That girl.)
(C'mon baby.)

So I went down to the emporium:
I'm gonna get me some epidermal art
I'm savin' up every penny 'cause
It'll cost me plenty, man, an' it's gonna smart

But she's my everything; she's my dream come true:
If I don't tell her, man, I don't what I'll do
It feels so good that I can't keep it to myself
I love that T E, double-N, E double-S double-E G I R L

She's my everything; she's my dream come true:
If I don't tell her, man, I don't what I'll do
It feels so good that I can't keep it to myself
I love that T E, double-N, E double-S double-E G I R L
T E, double-N, E double-S double-E G I R L

Ah, nah, nah, now, now, now, no, no
Ah, that girl, baby
You all got to get it to her for me
Aw, c'mon back, honey
I went to a lot of trouble to get this thing on here

I can chop wood, from dusk till dawn
I can swing a hammer, till the daylight's gone
I can build a barn, I can make a home with these two hands
But if I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man

I can fly a plane up in the big blue sky
Blaze a trail through the woods in my 4-wheel drive
With a team of horses or an old John Deere, I can plow this land
But if I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man

Chorus:
I can hang the stars, I can rope the moon
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots
I can run a train when it runs outta track
With the weight of the world laid across my back
But my life still wouldn't be worth a damn:
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man

I could build a fire, usin' nothin' but a stick
If I put my mind to it, there ain't much I can't fix
I can read and count, I can figure things out if you give me a chance
But if I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man

Chorus repeated twice:
I can hang the stars, I can rope the moon
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots
I can run a train when it runs outta track
With the weight of the world laid across my back
But my life still wouldn't be worth a damn:
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man

I can hang the stars, I can rope the moon
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots
I can run a train when it runs outta track
With the weight of the world laid across my back
But my life still wouldn't be worth a damn:
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man

I'd be half a man

I was raised doin' right from wrong
Baptized under that old rugged cross
I try to be a good man, I always give it my best
But truth be told some days I wanna go to the wild wild west


I wanna line 'em up and drink 'em
I wanna love 'em and leave 'em
Sometimes I just wanna just ride the train
Be the first straw in to have no sun
And feel the kick of my six gun
Yeah, I want "wanted" above my name
Sometimes I wanna be like Jesus
Sometimes I wanna be Jesse James

I know where to draw the line
But there's just something 'bout that other side
I got angels on my left, and demons on my right
It's a never ending battle, its a constant fight



I wanna steal a horse and ride into town
Stare the sheriff down
Tell him there's a new man around here
I wanna walk through those swingin' saloon doors
And hear my spurs hit the wooden floor
I wanna smell nothin' but fear, you hear?
Law don't go around here



You hear that law dog?
Law don't go around here


A woman is mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
And other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong


Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doing something right


Anywhere you want to go
Baby, show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm, whatever you say
Tonight's about giving you
What you want, whatever it takes
Girl, I hope I'm on the right road
And judging by the smile on your face


Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doing something right


Ah, Baby
Mmm


I don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doin' something right
Must be doin' something right

If I still had the heart to love the way I used to love you
I might still have some trace of my identity
If I still had just half a mind I'd call you up and ask you
Where you left the man I used to be

'Cause I miss me, I'm not the same
Just someone else usin' my name
I wish you'd come back soon
'Cause I miss me

I've been all up and down the roads that lead to my old memories
But I can't find the one with all my hopes and dreams
And I've been lookin' in my eyes for something I still recognize
Some strangers stare is all I see

I miss me, I'm not the same
Just someone else usin' my name
I wish you'd come back soon
'Cause I miss me

You made me a better man than I ever thought I'd be
And now that you're gone I can't move on

'Cause I miss me, I'm not the same
I'm just someone else usin' my name
I wish you'd come come home soon
'Cause I miss me, I miss me

It was like nails on a chalkboard when Daddy played his kinda music
If you'd have asked me then, I'd a said it was borderline abusive
But I'm gettin' to where I don't mind it now
I'm comin' around

I blew out of here the next day after graduation
Destination: anywhere with a higher population
Never to return to this tiny town
But I'm comin' around

I'm comin' around, I'm figurin' out
A lot of things I thought I knew
I never deamed I'd be seein' things
From this point of view
Still a little ways from slowin' it all the way down
But I'm comin' around

I'm comin' around, I'm figurin' out
A lot of things I thought I knew
I never deamed I'd be seein' things
From this point of view
Still a little ways from slowin' it all the way down
But I'm comin' around

I've never been that big of gettin' up on Sunday mornin'
And listen to that ol' preacher talk was always kinda borin'
I'm still a little more lost than I am found
But I'm comin' around

Yeah, I'm comin' around

I'm comin' around, I'm figurin' out
A lot of things I thought I knew
I never deamed I'd be seein' things
From this point of view
Still a little ways from slowin' it all the way down
But I'm comin' around

Yeah, I'm comin' around


Let's wake up in the afternoon
Pretend that we got nothing to do
No we don't have to go by any agenda
We can make up our own rules
I see the way you're looking at me
Baby, know I'm feeling it too
We can just light up every candle
Move from room to room


Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be
Hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush (No, no)
Baby, don't rush


Throw the map out the window
Taking the long way around
To a secret place where no one could find us
A little place we can call our own
Come over here and take a picture
Something we can hang on to
We can look back and try to remember
All the crazy things we're gonna do


Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be (supposed to be)
Just hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush
Baby, don't rush


Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Stopping every minute


Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be (supposed to be)
Just hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush (No, no)
Baby, don't rush (Baby, don't rush)
Baby, don't rush, no
Baby, don't rush

Well, if you ask me where I come from
Here's what I tell everyone
I was born by God's dear grace
In an extraordinary place
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

It's a big ol' land with countless dreams
Happiness ain't out of reach
Hard work pays off the way it should
Yeah, I've seen enough to know that we've got it good
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

There's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free

I pledge allegiance to this flag
And if that bothers you, well, that's too bad
But if you got pride and you're proud you do
Hey, we could use some more like me and you
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

Yes, there's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free

No, it ain't the only place on earth
But it's the only place that I prefer
To love my wife and raise my kids
Hey, the same way that my daddy did
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly


Thank y'all, how y'all doin'
Yeah, my names Colt Ford
I just came here to do a little song for y'all
'Bout where I come from, the way I see it
I brought my buddy Mr. John Michael Montgomery with me
He's gonna play a lil' guitar and sing a lil' bit
I'm gonna do a lil sumthin' for y'all
Called ride through the country, let's go John


Down the road where the black top ends
You can find Colt Ford with all his friends
We're used to gravel roads, and fishin' with cane poles
Wasn't no swimmin' pools, just swimmin' holes
We was dirt road poor, and cane switched raised
I done came a long way since back in the day
Been 'round the world twice seen all fifty states
Ate on thousand dollar china, but love some paper plates
There ain't nuthin' wrong with them big city lights
But me, I prefer them slow country nights
Where I can see the darkness come and then go
Most folks is honest, and they all speak slow
You can leave your door open, ain't nuttin'll happen
Most country folks sing, but I couldn't, so I'm rappin'
I wanna show y'all where I come from
And invite ya all down to any country town


Now before I pack and things and leave
There's somethin' I need y'all to understand
I seen alotta things in my lifetime that's why I walk the line
I'm just a simple man
And I done done things for cheap thrills
But all my scars heal, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from
You always will come to take a ride through the country


Up, dressed, and gone by 5 am
He's country, and he's rappin' we gots to play him
Folks been waitin' for some one like me
To give 'em some hot beats and spit that country
My jeans don't sag, they fit, and kinda tight
Got on a white t-shirt, no nothin' but work
Daylight 'til dark, that's how I was bred
And I'll keep bein' country 'til the day I'm dead
See, country folks eat biscuits called catheads
Barbeque, baked beans, sweet tea, and white bread
We like to fish and hunt, ain't scared of a fight
Love the good Lord and believe in doin' right
Got 4-wheel drives, some got mud on 'em
You can keep your Rolls Royce, 'cause baby, we don't want 'em!
So now y'all all know exactly who I am
And if you ain't into that, I don't give a damn!


Now before I pack and things and leave
There's somethin' I need y'all to understand
I seen alotta things in my lifetime that's why I walk the line
I'm just a simple man
And I done done things for cheap thrills
But all my scars heal, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from
You always will come to take a ride through the country


You might see my on your TV, but honey
That don't mean a thing, you see
I'm still that same 'ol country boy, and that's all I'll ever be
And sometime, those bright lights blind me
And make it hard for me to see
But when I need to be reminded
I take a ride through the country
Yeah


At about 5 o'clock on Friday afternoon
Them country boys head down to the local saloon
You're welcome to stop in and have a cold bottle
Big city boys and stuck up super models
We don't care where ya from, as long as you polite
'Cause push come to shove and every one of us will fight
We mostly easy like Sunday morning
Ol' Colt came here to give y'all fair warnin'
Country folks won't be pushed around
And there's some of us livin' in every town
We believe in the Bible, and the U.S.A
Work hard for what you want, it's the American way
No body owe you nothin' supposed to earn your keep
But in a hard days work, get a good nights sleep
I know some of y'all think ol' Colt's kinda odd
But I'm loud, proud and country by the grace of God


Now before I pack and things and leave
There's somethin' I need y'all to understand
I seen alotta things in my lifetime that's why I walk the line
I'm just a simple man
And I done done things for cheap thrills
But all my scars heal, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from
You always will come to take a ride through the country


Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Do not happen much anymore


We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life


Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when


I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country, soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times


I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then


Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when


Give me a flat top for strummin'
I want the whole world to be hummin'
Oh, just keep it comin'
The way it was back then


Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

Hey, look at all those cowgirls
Tearin' down the gravel roads on Saturday night
Singing, "Summertime" at the top of their lungs
Sippin' Dixie cups of strawberry wine

All my boys are out
We holler and whistle
And honk our horns in time

We're just country folks livin' loud
We're country folks livin' loud
We're just country folks livin' loud

We're crankin' Waylon Jennings in our pick-up trucks
Clinkin' beer bottles till the sun comes up
Mamma's in the church choir, oh, what a sound
We're country folks livin' loud

Drivin' tractors in the cotton till the cows come home
Boots on the dance floor, around we go
The Star Spangled Banner, we sing it proud
We're country folks livin' loud

Interstate's jammed with race fans
We're heading towards the Talladega infield sign
Our tailgates are droppin' and barbecue is poppin'
Everybody's gonna have a good time

Ain't nuthin' like those engines starting
And the crowd at the finish line

We're just country folks livin' loud
We're country folks livin' loud
We're just country folks livin' loud

We're crankin' Waylon Jennings in our pick-up trucks
Clinkin' beer bottles till the sun comes up
Mama's in the church choir, oh, what a sound
We're country folks livin' loud

Drivin' tractors in the cotton till the cows come home
Boots on the dance floor, around we go
The Star Spangled Banner, we sing it proud
We're country folks livin' loud

It's a hoot and a holler on a touchdown pass
A George Strait crowd when he tips his hat
Lord, ain't that what it's all about?

We're just country folks livin' loud
We're country folks livin' loud
We're just country folks livin' loud

We're crankin' Waylon Jennings in our pickup trucks
Clinkin' beer bottles till the sun comes up
Mamma's in the church choir, oh, what a sound
We're country folks livin' loud

Drivin' tractors in the cotton till the cows come home
Boots on the dance floor, around we go
The Star Spangled Banner, we sing it proud
We're country folks livin' loud
We're country folks livin' loud

We're country and we're livin' loud


Tell me about it
Ooh!


Men: Have you ever tried to figure them out?
Huh, me too, but I ain't got no clue, how 'bout you?
Men are like shoes, made to confuse
Yeah, there's so many of 'em
I don't know which ones to choose
Ah, sing it to me if you agree
There's the kind made for running
The sneakers and the low down heels
The kind that will keep you on your toes
And every girl knows how that feels (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ouch, ah, sing it with me


Ya got your kickers and your ropers, your everyday loafers
And some that you can never find
You've got your slippers and your zippers, your grabbers and your grippers
Man, don't you hate that kind?
Some you wear in, an' some you wear out
Some you want to leave behind
Sometimes you hate 'em, an' sometimes you love 'em
I guess it all depends on which way you rub 'em
But a girl can never have too many of 'em


It's amazing what a little polish will do
Men are like shoes


Some make you feel ten feet tall
Some make you feel so small
An' some you want to leave out in the hall
Or make you feel like kicking the wall (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ah, sing it with me, girls
Ooh! (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mmm


Ya got your kickers and your ropers, your everyday loafers
And some that you can never find
You've got your slippers and your zippers, your grabbers and your grippers
Man, don't you hate that kind?
Some you wear in, an' some you wear out
Some you want to leave behind
Sometimes you hate 'em, an' sometimes you love 'em
I guess it all depends on which way you rub 'em
But a girl can never have too many of 'em


Some can polish up pretty good
Ah, men are like shoes


It's amazing what a little polish will do
Some clean up good, just like new
Some you can't afford, some are real cheap
Some are good for bumming around on the beach


Ya got your kickers and your ropers, your everyday loafers
Yeah, some that you can never find
You've got your slippers and your zippers, your grabbers and your grippers
Man, don't you hate that kind?
Ya got your kickers and your ropers, your everyday loafers
And some that you can never find
You've got your slippers and your zippers, your grabbers and your grippers
An' man, don't you hate that kind?
Some you wear in, an' some you wear out
Some you want to leave behind
Sometimes you hate 'em, an' sometimes you love 'em
I guess it all depends on which way you rub 'em
But a girl can never have too many of 'em


I ain't got time for the flip-flop kind
Men are like shoes!

Way down at the bottom of the river
There's a locket with a picture of me
She drowned what I thought was forever
She locked up our love and lost the key
A friend of mine heard from a friend of hers
She was workin' on last name number three
There was a time I'd have relished those words
But I'm not where I used to be

Way down
Weighted down at the bottom
I almost drown in a shallow dream
A light shined down and life was waiting at the top when
I let go of the past that was draggin me

Way down an Oklahoma highway
There's a cafe where they'll remember me
I broke down by a payphone in the hallway
Put my fist through a drywall sheet
I hit a wall trying to find some kinda way
To find some peace
Buried it all when I dug a grave for all the
Pain that was pulling me

Way down
Weighted down at the bottom
I almost drown in a shallow dream
A light shined down and life was waiting at the top when
I let go of the past that was dragging me

Way down
Way down
Way down, way down, way down, way down


Lay your pretty head down on my shoulder
You don’t have to worry anymore
This old world is cold and getting colder
And I know how to lock and bolt the door
I’m strong enough to hold you through the winter
Mean enough to stare your demons down
The hard times put the shine into the diamond
I won’t let that keep us in the ground


I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor


If we ain't got no money, I can make it
And I ain't afraid of working to the bone
When I don’t know what I'm doing, I can fake it
I'll pray 'til jesus rolls away the stone


I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor


I'm a trier
I'm a get down low so I can lift you higher
An army couldn’t keep down my desire
Yeah


I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire

A stray bullet and a momma cries
Her baby won't be coming home tonight
Sirens screaming down the avenue
Just another story on the evening news, oh, whoa
Politics and prejudice
How the hell it'd ever come to this?
When everybody's gotta pick a side
It don't matter if you're wrong or right, no
And so it goes, but I hold onto hope and I won't let go 'cause


I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins


Sometimes it takes a lot of faith
To keep believing there will come a day
When the tears and the sadness, the pain and the hate
The struggle, this madness, will all fade away, yeah


I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins


Love is power, love is a smile
Love reaches out, love is the remedy
Love is the answer, love's an open door
Love is the only thing worth fighting for, yeah


I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins
Oh, yeah, love wins


Love will, love can, love still, love wins
Love will, love can, love still, love wins


Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when


Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when


Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when


Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when


Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are
Where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when
Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

The first time we did it I was scared to death
She snuck out in that cotton dress
Jumped on in and we drove to the lake
Put her hand on my knee and said I can?t wait
I had everything we needed in the bed of my truck
Turns out my baby loves to...


Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She?s hooked and now she can?t get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish

After that that?s all she wanted to do
But that was okay ?cause I did too
She always wants to go down by the dam
And I love how she looks with that rod in her hand
If they ain?t bitin? she don?t give up
Turns out my baby loves to...


Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night

She?s hooked and now she can?t get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish

I love to see her silhouette reflectin? off the water
With her hooks and her sinkers and her pretty pink bobbers
The first time I saw her I knew I was in love
?Cause I found a girl who loves to...

Fish, I love to see her lyin?
There on the bank ?neath the full moon light
Man, I can?t even believe my luck
I found a girl who loves to...


Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She?s hooked and now she can?t get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish
Yeah, I know she loves to fish
Psst, you awake, let?s fish

She met him in a motel room in the shady part of town
With a set of satin sheets pulled back
And the window shades pulled down
Like a cotton dress, she let her fears fall down to the ground

With a "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door
She whispered I've never prayed to you before

Some people meet him in a church at a service on Sunday
As the preacher says the perfect words, they bow their heads to pray
And the choir sings a sweet forgiveness tune
She met him in a motel room

With a bottle full of sleeping pills and a long list of sins
She'd already planned on checking out before she checked in
She was gonna leave a goodbye note
Just needed paper and a pen

With that vacancy light blinking red
She found that bible in the drawer beside the bed

Some people meet him in a church at a service on Sunday
As the preacher says the perfect words, they bow their heads to pray
And the choir sings a sweet forgiveness tune
She met him in a motel room

No choir sang a sweet forgiveness tune
That's not the way that they were introduced
She met him in a motel room
She met him in a motel room

You say that we need to talk, but you ain't said a word
But trust me baby, it's all crystal clear
You doing anything and everything to dance around the hurt
Trying hard, muster up a tear

But save yourself the trouble, boy
Don't go wasting your time like you're wasting mine
I don't need your reasons why
Don't you worry your pretty little head about me

I'll be just fine
Oh, I'll be just fine

You need some time, you need some space, and I deserve much more
You say you've changed, we're in a different place
Yeah, it's not me and blah, blah, blah, I've heard it all before
So before you go and throw your breath away

Save yourself the trouble, boy
Don't go wasting your time like you're wasting mine
I don't need your reasons why
Don't you worry your pretty little head about me

I'll be just fine

This time, when you walk out the door, it won't be like it was before
When you wake up and wanna change your mind

So, save yourself the trouble, boy
Don't go wasting your time like you're wasting mine
I don't need your reasons why
Don't you worry your pretty little head about me, no

Don't you worry your pretty little head about me
I'll be just fine

Oh, I'll be just fine

You walked through the door
With her by your side
My heart on the floor
I swallowed my pride
It hurts to see you
So happy again
It hurts to see you
Like we were back then
She's as pretty as she can be
I can't blame you for not wanting me
And I can tell by the way you're looking at her
You're so happy, the way that we were
As y'all danced together
Her head on your heart
It feels like forever since I fell apart
Here I go now
I'm walking to you
God I don't know how
I am even talking to you
'Cause she's as pretty as she can be
No I can't blame you for not wanting me
And I can tell, I can tell, I can tell
You're so happy, the way that we were

No, nobody; nobody ever died of a broken heart
No, nobody; nobody ever died of a broken heart

Must'a hit you like a hurricane
Now you're swimmin' with a ball and chain
Sweet love goin' down the drain
Down, down
Girl, you're lookin' like the walkin dead
Need to drag a brush across that head
The crack of noon and you're still in bed
Straighten up, wake up put on your make-up

No, nobody; nobody ever died of a broken heart
No, nobody; nobody ever died of a broken heart

Cut his head out of every picture
From the letters where he said that he missed ya
All his memories, well you can kiss 'em
Bye, bye
When enough is, for sure, enough
Time to shake it out and shake it up
Get in the middle of a great big love
Wham-bam, thank you ma'am
Baby, here we go again

No, nobody; nobody ever died of a broken heart
No, nobody; nobody ever died of a broken heart
Nobody ever died of a broken heart
Nobody ever died of a broken heart

Ain't it just like one of us
To pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks
And say how you been, I've been wondering if
Maybe you've been thinkin about me
And somewhere in the conversation
An old familiar invitation always arrives
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

Everyone's known someone that they
Just can't help but want
Even though we just can't make it work out
The want to, lingers on
So once again, we wind up in each other's arms
Pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

I know it's wrong, but it ain't easy movin' on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again

Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feelin' a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad
I guess that's what it is all lonely
Late night calls like this, that we try to find
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
I may hate msyelf in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

Weatherman says it might hit 95
September's gonna feel more like July
He's callin' for a night that's warm and mild
I think he missed it by a mile
He just don't know that you're gone
I feel a cold one comin' on
Driving home gets longer every day
I've found new things to do along the way
A bar room ain't no place to run and hide
From the memories of a love that said goodbye
I'm sick and tired of right and wrong
I feel a cold one comin' on

Makes you want to start thinkin'
About drinkin'
If I don't fine a way to ease my mind
And leave all this behind
I'm gonna go crazy, without you baby
A bar room or that bedroom back at home
I feel a cold one comin' on

Makes you want to start thinkin'
About drinkin'
If I don't fine a way to ease my mind
And leave all this behind
I'm gonna go crazy, without you baby
A bar room or that bedroom back at home
I feel a cold one comin' on


Yeah


That lit up, ringing, buzzing good for nothing phone in your hands
With directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight


'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear


I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it


Let's start with them Luccheses
Baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
Them bobby pins holdin' your hair up
Girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it tonight
Yeah girl


I don't think you know what you're doin' to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it


'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby I swear
Um


I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it


Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

Next year
Thought by now she'd have a man
Two car seats and a minivan
But it still ain't here
(Hey!)
She's been lookin' for Mr. Right so long
But all she's found is Mr. Wrong
That's the pits


She's drawn a line that she won't cross
Her and time are facing off
She says something's gotta give


Something's gotta give me butterflies
Something's gotta make me feel alive
Something's gotta give me dreams at night
Something's gotta make me feel alright
I don't know where it is
But something's gotta give


Friday night she had a date
Cell phone junky
A half hour late
That's the biz, baby


She's riding out the twists of fate
She's had all that she can take
She says something's gotta give


Something's gotta give me butterflies
Something's gotta make me feel alive
Something's gotta give me dreams at night
Something's gotta make me feel alright
I don't know where it is
But something's gotta give


I swear
There's got to be a meant to be for me out there
Somewhere someday

Let Me
Pat Green

Keep your head there on my shoulder
Let's just lay here for awhile
We can hurry when we're older
And girl, don't worry about tomorrow
That just seems so far away
Love for me, me and you
All that we have to do is follow
Just follow

Let me be the one who sets your feet up on a road where you've never been
Oh, and baby then
You can let me take these arms and wrap you up inside a night that will never end
I want to be that man
If you let me
C'mon, baby, let me

Baby, leave those candles burning
Slide on over here to me
If you run with me, girl
You know we'll make this world stop turning
Just stop turning

Let me be the one who sets your feet up on a road where you've never been
Oh, and baby then
You can let me take these arms and wrap you up inside a night that will never end
Well, I can be that man
If you let me
Oh, whoa

Let me be the one who sets your feet up on a road where you've never been
Yeah, and let me take these arms and wrap you up inside a night that will never end
I want to be that man
If you'd let me


Lately i have been spending lots of time with my kid
Telling him stories
About the things that we did
When we were a family
Long time ago
I've answered his questions
Till i'm blue in the face
Wish all that hurt in him
I could erase
But i tell him the truth
Cause he is not to young to know


Single father
Part time mother
When i'm not one
Then i'm the other
You used to be
My full time lover
Now i'm a single father
And a part time mother


I spend every minute
I can with my boy
There's no doubt about it
Hes my pride and joy
Someday he will grow up
And i won't have him no more
Some things i just find
Too hard to explain
So we go to McDonald's
Or i buy him a train
And we go put it together
On the living room floor

Such is the life
Of a single father
He says daddy explain
If its not too much bother
While its just you and me
Living here in this home
I don't understand it
And neither does he
Why there's just two
When there should be three of us
Sharing this moment
Lord i feel so alone




Don't you worry 'bout gettin' fixed up
When you wake up, you're pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust
That's my headlights, that's my truck


Come on baby, don't you keep me waitin'
I gotta go, I've got a reservation
Tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms


Whoa girl, every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa, this is one that we don't wanna miss, no


Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight


Girl I bet you thought I lost my mind
Outta the blue pulling into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear


Whoa girl, you never look better than you do right now
Whoa oh heaven, let your light shine down


Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight


Whoa girl, every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa, this is one that we don't wanna miss, no


Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight


Hey baby don't it feel so right
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
All I wanna do is hold you tight
Come on, come on, come on we're runnin' outta moonlight


Whoa
Yeah, we're runnin' outta moonlight
Whoa


Girl I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice


Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' there watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe


I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it


Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar


I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it


Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now
Girl, I'm so glad, I'm so glad


I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

I'm glad you picked up the phone
Yeah, I know that we both agreed
We'd leave each other alone
We're just wastin' our time
We know it ain't right
There's no goin' back, but havin' said that:

I wish you would come over
An' drink my best bottle of wine
If you can lay on my shoulder
An' I can lean on you just one more time
You can mess up head
An' mess up my bed
An' leave before the mornin' light
I need your on again, off again, on again tonight

I don't expect things to change
We've got to get on with our lives
Space is a beautiful thing
When you need some room
I don't know about you, but I'm lonely right now:
I'm just thinkin' out loud

I wish you would come over
An' drink my best bottle of wine
You can lay on my shoulder
An' I can lean on you just one more time
You can mess up head
An' mess up my bed
An' leave before the mornin' light
An' I need your on again, off again, on again tonight

Well, no, I don't care; I can come over there
An' I can drink your best bottle of wine:
'Cause I need your on again, off again, on again;
Your on again, off again, on again tonight
Again tonight


Just the thought of you around
Gets my head spinning, in circles
Just the way you say my name
Gets my heart turning, in circles


You got me spinning like a wheel
Oh how you make me feel
It's more than gold on my finger
It's six feet down and forever
Cause where I am
Is where you begin
You picked up the pieces
And put me together
You're the only part of me unbroken
And I'm going, in circles


Every crooked little lie
Bended, connected, circles
Every star up in the sky
Every hello and goodbye
Every moment by your side
Is the meaning of my life


You got me spinning like a wheel
Oh how you make me feel
It's more than gold on my finger
It's six feet down and forever
Cause where I am
Is where you begin
You picked up the pieces
And put me together
You're the only part of me unbroken
And I'm going, in circles
In circles


Just the thought of you around
Gets my head spinning, in circles
Just the way you say my name
Gets my heart turning, turning, turning
Around and 'round again


You got me spinning like a wheel
Oh how you make me feel
It's more than gold on my finger
It's six feet down and forever
Cause where I am
Is where you begin
You picked up the pieces
And put me together
You're the only part of me unbroken
And I'm going, in circles
In circles


Just the thought of you around
Gets my head spinning, in circles


She's a little red wine, he's a little bit whiskey smoke
He's a ragged on the edge, she's keeping him holding out hope
She's a front pew hallelujah, drop another 20 in the plate
He's on the back row a little hung over, bout 20 minutes late


She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy


Well she's sundress cotton, he's grease on a Carhartt shirt
And she's a candle in the wind, he's a light it up and let it burn
And every time she's with him, all she wants to do is kiss him
Starts thinking maybe she can fix him
He's thinkin' he'd love to let her try


She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy


And every time she's with him
She knows she prolly oughta quit him
But he don't wanna let her get away


She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy


Yeah
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
But fallin' for a bad boy


If you love somebody
You better let it out
Don't hold it back
While you're tryin' to figure it out
Don't be timid
Don't be afraid to hurt
Run toward the flame
Run toward the fire
And hold on for all you're worth
'Cause the only real pain a heart can ever know
Is the sorrow of regret when you don't let your feelin's show


So did you say it?
Did you mean it?
Did you lay it on the line, did you make it count?
Did you look 'em in the eye and did they feel it?
Did you say it in time, did you say it out loud?
'Cause if you did hun
Then you've lived some
And that feelin' inside
That's called satisfied


Busy people walkin' by
Can't help but worry some
So many things to do
And so little love gets done
Empty hearts everywhere
Drownin' but dying of thirst
If we want love
It's not that tough
Start by givin' it first
It's easy to give baby can't you see
Just close your eyes, open your heart and do what comes naturally


So did you say it?
Did you mean it?
Did you lay it on the line, did you make it count?
Did you look 'em in the eye and did they feel it?
Did you say it in time, did you say it out loud?
'Cause if you did hun
Then you've lived some
And that feelin' inside
That's called satisfied


Horses are built to run
The sun was meant to shine above
Flowers are made to bloom
And there's us
We were born to love
We were born to love


So did you say it?
Did you mean it?
Did you lay it all on the line?
Did you say it?
Did you mean it?
Did you lay it on the line, did you make it count?
Did you look 'em in the eye and did they feel it?
Did you say it in time, did you say it out loud?
Because if you did hun
Then you've lived some
And that feeling inside
That's called satisfied


La dah la, la la la
That's called satisfied
La dah la, la dah dah


Said her name was a hand me down name
From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips


She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rocking on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said, "Let's go and get it on"
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don’t know what it meant but it felt good on my lips


Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you


Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips


She ordered us a drink, it was a purple kind of pink
She said it’s got a shot of a little bit of everything
Mellow yellow umbrella for a fella like me
It was just a bit mellow for me to be seen with
But I took a sip, yeah it felt good on my lips


Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you


Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips


When the lights came on and they hollered last call
I was busy getting lost in her cherry lip gloss
In a little corner booth, eye to eye no talk
She leaned in close and gave me one long
And wet Goodnight goodbye kiss and It felt good on my lips




Whoa, how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips
Whoa, how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips


She talked with a drawl
Had me wrapped around her pretty little finger
Her eyes caught mine
Pulled me in like the tide; hook, line and sinker
I was hung up on her kiss
'Bout as good as it gets


Cause she was the right girl
Yes, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasing down the stars
Talking 'bout forever
But I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't stop on a dime...
Cause she was the right girl
The right girl at the wrong time


Things can't stay the same
When we got a couple hundred miles between each other
Different states, we ain't
We ain't never been good at being long distance lovers
I guess it is what it is
And that's the heartbreak I still can't forget


Cause she was the right girl
Yes, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasing down the stars
Talking 'bout forever
But I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't stop on a dime...
Cause she was the right girl
The right girl at the wrong time


If two hearts were meant to be, they'll find their way I guess
But when goodbye started, man, I was a mess


Cause she was the right girl
Yes, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasing down the stars
Talking 'bout forever
And I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't stop on a dime...
Cause she was the right girl
The right girl, at the wrong time


You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl
I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too


'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted


Anyone can tell you you're pretty
You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight


When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause baby I, wanna make you feel wanted


As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted


And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Yeah, baby I wanna make you feel
Wanted


Cause you'll always be wanted


Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up


Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: "What'll it be?"
I said: "The good stuff"


He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: "You can't find that here


Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"


He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: "I'll have some of that"
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends


I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: "That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed"


He said "Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey


Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"


He said: "When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
Because that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff"


Always stayin' out late, get off at 8
But you come to door at 3
Name on your phone says caller unknown
But girl you ain't foolin' me
I can see it in your eyes and all the shh you hide


All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses


Say you're out with your friends, try to pretend
Like I don't know what you're doing
It's funny to me, the joke is on you
And girl I see through it


All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid
Girl you ain't foolin' me

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
And nothing's quite the same now
I just say your name now

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had

So you stole my world, now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and loney
Well send it in a letter
Make yourself feel better

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You dont want me back
You're just the best I ever had

And it might take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I, I run away and hide
And I might find in time that you were always right
You're always right

So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now, I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Was it what you wanted?
Could it be I'm haunted?

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You dont want me back
You're just the best I ever had

You're just the best I ever had


I drive an Army Jeep
My bumper sticker reads
"Drink 'til he's cute"
That's what I'm gonna do

Ain't got no serious thing
Don't wear a diamond ring
I got a new tattoo
I think you'll like the view

And in my mind
The sun shines
All the time


('Cause) I'm just a summer girl
I wear my flip flops
When I let my hair down
(That's when the party starts)
(The party never stops)

Who needs a boyfriend
I got my girl friends
When we get together
The summer never ends

Yeah yeah, oh oh oh
(I'm just a summer girl)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)


Tanks tops and cutoff jeans
Bikinis and belly rings
We'll make that scene
When the DJ plays "Dancin' Queen"

Fellas, lay your money down
We'll let'ya buy a round
Don't push your luck
Don't get more than your hopes up

In my world
Day or night
Rain or shine




Everybody needs a little bit of sunshine
Everybody needs time to unwind
Everybody's got to have a good time
(I'm just a summer girl)

Everybody get up on your feet
Everybody got to shake your body
Everybody got a right to be free
(I'm just a summer girl)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)






Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree


Hey, whatever happened to waitin your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic


If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out


Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic


Automatic


Let's pull the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on let's take a picture
The kind you gotta shake


Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

Woo hoo!

Baby where you been? It's half past ten
Oh, look you're late again
Busy day, got a lot on your mind?
You should hear about mine

A tall drink of water and a pretty little thing
Were kissing on the corner in the pouring rain
Turned my head to get a better view
Oh Lord help me, it was you

Didn't love me
I ain't no fool
Didn't love me
No, no, no, no

Love, love you let me down
Making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving

Love, love you let me down, let me down
No, you won't string me along
You better be moving on
Giddy on up and giddy on out

Oh I ain't finished
Sit back down

Been acting pretty strange, didn't want to talk
Mmm, there's a pep in your walk
Smiling a lot when you look at your phone
There's a change in your tone

I've been through your pockets and smelled your shirts
I don't wear Bath and Body Works
Should've seen the signs you were sneakin' around
She must be the number on the napkin I found

Didn't love me
I ain't no fool
Didn't love me
No, no, no, no

Love, love you let me down
Making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving

Love, love you let me down, let me down
No, you won't string me along
You better be moving on
Giddy on up and giddy on out

Oh let me tell you
I guess you could say that I was blind
I was blinded by my love
I did everything for you
And now push has come to shove

So let's call the spade a spade
Was it worth the price you paid?
Now I am done, I'm a lucky one
And you can sleep in the bed you've made

Didn't love me
I ain't no fool
Didn't love me
No, no, no, no

Love, love you let me down
You're making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving

Love, love you let me down, let me down
No, you won't string me along

Love, love you let me down
Making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving

Love, love you let me down, let me down
You won't string me along
You better be moving on
Giddy on up and giddy on out

Ridin' restless under broken sky
Weary traveller, somethin' missin' inside
Always lookin' for a reason to turn around
Desperate for a little peace of mind
Just a little piece of what I left behind:
Well, I found it now: you're like coming home

You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road
You're like coming home;
You're like coming home, all right

Go head an' let your hair fall down
This wanderlust: it's gone now
I'm here in your arms; I'm safe from the road again
These are the days that can't be erased:
Baby, there isn't a better place;
You're like heaven: you're like coming home

You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road
You're like coming home;

You're that innocence, that serenity
That long-lost part of me

You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
A midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road

You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road
You're like coming home, yeah
You're like coming home;
Baby, like coming home;
You're like coming home


Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love


Each morning the sun shines through my window
Lands on the face of a dream come true
I shuffle to the kitchen for my coffee
And catch up on the front page morning news
Then she walks up behind me
And throws her arms around my neck
Just another normal thing
I've come to expect


It's ordinary, plain and simple
Typical, this everyday love
Same ol', same ol' keeping it new
Emotional, so familiar
Nothing about it too peculiar
Oh, but I can't get enough
Of this everyday love, yeah


Every afternoon I make a phone call
Listen to the voice that warms my heart
I drag myself through a few more hours
Then head on home to try and beat the dark
Her smile will be right there
When I step through that door
And it will be that way tomorrow
Just like every day before




Wouldn't change one single thing about it
No, it's run-of-the-mill
Still I can't live without it




Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough


From the hills to Kaycee, Wyoming
Where life's wooly and wild
Came an Air Force brat
In a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile
And from bucking broncs
To honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy's song
We were much too young
Having too much fun
As we all sang along


(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride


From gold buckles to gold records
Well, once again he was spinning 'round
Took the whole world on
And he turned us on
To that Western Underground
And from "Bareback Jack"
To "This Cowboy's Hat"
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down
From town to town
Like children running through the rain


(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride


I bet he crossed that river Jordan
With St. Peter on the other side
Singing good ride cowboy, good ride
Good ride cowboy, good ride

I reached for you this morning
Woke up with empty arms
Once again
It's sinking in
How far away you are

I still pour two cups of coffee
And tell you all about my dreams
This kitchen's way too quiet
You should still be here with me

And even though I cry like crazy
Even though it hurts so bad
I'm thankful for the time God gave me
Even though we couldn't make it last
I'm learning how to live without you
Even though I don't want to
And even with you gone
Love lives on

I still call your mom on Sundays
Yeah, it's good to hear her voice
She always tells me that same story
About her stubborn little boy

And I kept your favorite t-shirt
You know, the one I used to hate
Ain't it funny how
It's the one thing now
I just can't throw away

And even though I cry like crazy
Even though it hurts so bad
I'm thankful for the time God gave me
Even though we couldn't make it last
I'm learning how to live without you
Even though I don't want to
And even with you gone
Love lives on

She comes with me on your birthday
Little flowers in her hand
She's always known that somethings missing
But too young to understand
And some day she's gonna ask me
What kind of man you were
I'll tell her all the ways I loved you
And all of you I see in her

And even though I cry like crazy
Even though it hurts so bad
I'm thankful for the time God gave me
And she's the perfect way to make it last
I'm learning how to live without you
Baby I don't want to
But even with you gone
Love lives on

Baby love lives on, love lives on
Oh oh oh oh yeah
I reached for you this morning
Woke up with empty arms

She reaches out to touch me
Shes smiles when i get lost in her brown eyes
Just knowing that she loves me
Makes everything thats wrong in my world alright

And theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen

Chorus

I jump out of bed, and i jump in the shower
Get dressed in a hurry, just to wait in rush hour
Drink cold coffee from a styrofoam cup
Sittin at my desk workin just as the sun comes up
The phones don't stop and my head keeps spinnin
Gotta keep puttin up with the crap just to make a livin
Its yes sir no sir haven't got the answer call me in the
Mornin its past five again
And theeeeeeeeeen

She reaches out to hold me
Its peace i find when im in her lovin heart
Just knowin that shes always there gives me the strength i need
To keep goin on
And theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen

Chorus

Its day after day of the same old thing
Can't help feeling like a puppet on a string
To keep me dancin to the same old song
Before i know it my vacations come and gone
Im just sick and tired of the constant grind
Hangin by a thread goin out of my mind
Doctors, taxes, lawyers, faxes it a vicious circle goin
Round and round again
And theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen

Just knowin that she loves me
Makes everything thats wrong in my world alright
And theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
And then

I ain't going to work, ain't going to class
Going bare feet and kickin' back
Gonna pacify my lazy bones ambition
Chillin'

I'm talkin', jet skis and inner tubes
Pretty girls with big ol' blue eyes
And wet t-shirts on the river

Just chillin'
Beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soaking up every minute

Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Chillin'

Good ol' boys sitting on a rock
Passing a jar and an old flat top singin'
Seeger, Cash, Bo Diddley and Bob Dylan
Just a chillin'

Moon comes up and the sun goes down
Under Candy Fort Bridge they're hangin' out
Bunch of happy-go-luckies, skinny dippin'

Yeah, we're chillin'
Beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soaking up every minute

Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Just chillin'

Yeah, we're chillin'
We're beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soakin' up every single minute

Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Just chillin'

Beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soakin' up every single minute

Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Chillin'

Yeah, we're chillin'
Oh yeah


Woah, woah
Wo-wooah, mmm


If I could make a living from walking in the woods
You can bet I'd be sitting pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheeling and dealing and sittin' there reeling 'em in


Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day


I'd get a little Farm Pond bus
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pulling the string on a nine point nine two stroke, mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go


We get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich, Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day


So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here, knee deep, in the Muckalee
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Lets go there in our mind


Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the morning, dark whiskey in the evening
I get red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Come on


Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Yeah


It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh


Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair


And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long


Catching wild life from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll


While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long


Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again


And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long


Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Worked all week, got it all done
Lets make a Tennessee River Run

Hey everybody I think the time is right
Lets get together down where the catfish bite
Cooped up all winter
Waiting on a day like this
It's the way I feel when I'm rockin on the water
Baby that I can't resist
Bar-B-Q grill, summer time jam
Just about a mile above the Pickwick Dam
Party on the water whole lotta fun
Time to make a Tennessee River Run

I'll get my bass boat, crank up your party barge
We'll drop these anchors out where the big boats are
Break out a cooler, pass out ice-cold beer
Look at all the people out here on the water
Man I can't believe we're here

Swingin' on a rope gonna have a ball
Jumpin' off the Yellow Creek waterfall
Checkin out the honeys, bakin in the sun
God bless a Tennessee River Run

Doo-dee n' doo dee

Does anybody else want to stay a little longer
Or am I gonna be alone?

Floatin on a tube, gonna weigh a ton
Cajun sausage on a hot dog bun
Bar-B-Q grill, summertime jam
Just about a mile above the Pickwick Dam
Party on the water, whole lotta fun
Time to make a Tennessee River Run

Doo-dee n' doo dee
Doo dee n' doo
Doo dee n' doo dee

Doo-dee n' doo dee

Nothin like a Tennessee River Run
I love a Tennessee River Run
Whoop up a Tennessee River Run

How many beer bottle caps fill a cowboy hat
(I don't know, but I'm gonna find out)
How many miles of sand to walk my flip-flops flat
(I don't know, but I'm gonna find out)
How many tiny drink umbrellas can you hold between your toes
Tomorrow you can tell 'em
You know someone who knows

It's my time
(Oh) it's what I love
Well, it ain't my job
But I wish it was
It ain't no crime
Doin' what you love to do
Hey, it's my time
I can waste it if I want to

How long does it take to spoon feed a beer
(I don't know, but I'm gonna find out)
To make your sexy little tan lines disappear
(I don't know, but I'm gonna find out)
How many jaunts in the ocean and rub-it-back-ons
Are in a 32 oz. bottle'a Coppertone

It's my time
(Oh) it's what I love
Well, it ain't my job
But I wish it was

Doin' what you love to do

How many Tylenols for my head not to hurt

Baby, how long can we hold one kiss
With just one breath
I mean somethin' like this, whew

It's my time

Well, it ain't my job
But I wish it was
It ain't no crime
Doin' what you love to do
Hey, it's my time

(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)


Never was the kind to think about dressing in white
Wasn't waiting on a prince to come riding into my life
Thought I was happy on my own
'Til you came and proved me wrong


I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)


Never pictured myself singing lullabies
Sitting in a rocking chair in the middle of the night
In the quiet, in the dark
You're stealing every bit of my heart with your daddy's eyes
What a sweet surprise


And now I'm holdin' what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up, oh, with your love


Life has a way of showing you just what you need
And who you were made to be, yeah


I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love
Yeah, you filled it up with your love, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)


I never was the kind to think about dressing in white
I never pictured myself singing lullabies


Dirt, Mud, and Dust
Bibles and Beer
Outlaws, Barb Wire, Saddles, and Steers
Its a simple life, Oh its sacred ground
Hard times, High winds can't bring us down


In cowboy town, yeah cowboy town
That's were I'm from
Cowboy town


We wear our boots to dinner
Drive our trucks to church
Solid as a rock
Salt of the earth
We like our whiskey strong
Play our music loud
Get things done by the sweat of our brow




Winners, Losers, Sinners and Saints
It's were a good man's word is money in the bank
Bad boys, pretty girls is the name of the game
When you hit the ground, get up, shake off the pain
That's a cowboy town
Someday when I die and my soul is called home
High on a white horse I'll ride up on it
That golden chute will stand old St. Pete
He'll tip his hat and welcome me



Someday she wants a big ol' house
Sittin' on a big ol' hill
And a mile long tree lined driveway
For her big ol' Coupe DeVille
Yeah, someday she wants a big ol' bank account
With too much to spend
But right now all she wants is a man

With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter
Size matters, size matters

Someday she wants a big o' ring
With a big ol' rock that shines
And a big ol' walk-in closet
With shoes of every kind
Yeah, someday she wants a big ol' boat
She can lay around gettin' a tan
But right now all she wants is a man

With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter
Size matters, size matters

With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter
Size matters, size matters

Size matters

Verse 1: i stumbled across your picture today i could barely breathe the moment stopped me cold and grabbed me like a thief i dialed your number but you wouldn't be there i knew the whole time but its still not fair i just wanted to hear your voice i just needed to hear your voice

Chorus: what do i do with all i need to say so much i wanna tell you everyday though it breaks my heart i cry these tears in the dark i write these letters to you but they get lost in the blue cause theres no address in the stars

Sometimes when I sleep
I can see you walkin' back to me
And sometimes I wake up
'Cause I swear I felt your touch
Then emotions overcome me
And the darkness is so cold

I light a candle
Watch it burn
I feel the angels come and
Fill this room
When you're gone
I miss you so much
I do the only thing I can do
I pray for you
I pray for you

Every minute of the day
I can clearly see your face
And every minute we're apart
Oh you know it juts breaks my heart
I'm so lonely
But I'm okay
'Cause I know we'll be together again

I light a candle
Watch it burn
I feel the angels come and
Fill this room
When you're gone
I miss you so much
I do the only thing I can do
I pray for you
I pray for you

Oh, I pray for you

Ohhh I light a candle
Watch it burn
I feel the angels come and
Fill this room
When you're gone
I miss you so much
I do the only thing I can do
I pray for you
I pray for you

Oh, I pray for you
Please hold her
And protect her
Till she's back here in my arms again
Oh tell her
How I love her
And I'll be waiting right here forever
Amen


I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan


My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around


And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah


I found my billfold
I cried oh no no
Good time Charlie got me now I'm broke
But it was worth acting like a fool
Yeah girl I must have really showed you


Cause all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah


I was Elvis rocking on the bar
Working the crowd pouring out my heart


And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire
Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher
If we roll from town to town and never shut it down
Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover
Would we walk even closer until the trip was over
And would it be okay if I didn't know the way


If I gave you my hand
Would you take it and make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Let me know if you're really a dream
I love you so
So would you go with me


Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me


If I gave you my hand
Would you take it and make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Help me tie up the ends of a dream
I gotta know, would you go with me
I love you so, so would you go with me

I can hear you downstairs crying on the phone
Telling someone that I'm here but you still feel all alone
Maybe we were too young
Goodbye, I've gotta go
I can hear the baby waking up
Got to get back to the life I know

I should have never believed him
Maybe I should just leave here

Maybe I'm not but you're all I got left to believe in
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive
And I know that it's been hard
And it's been a long time coming
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive

No one thought I was good enough for you
Except for you
Don't let them be right
After all that we've been through
'Cause somewhere over that rainbow
There's a place for me
A place with you

Maybe I'm not but you're all I got left to believe in
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive
I know that it's been hard
And it's been a long time coming
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive

In every frame upon our wall
Lies a face that's seen it all
Through ups and downs and then more downs
We helped each other off of the ground
No one knows what we've been through
Making it ain't making it without you

Maybe I'm not but you're all I got left to believe in
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive
I know that it's been hard
And it's been a long time coming
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive

I'm about to come alive


I had a hand me down ride painted rattle can red
Second hand tires with poor boy tread
Made a lot of almost love in the bed of that
Truck that got stuck a lot
Just letter jacket boys singing Jerry Jeff songs
Drinking everything we could get our hands on
Learning ‘bout right by doin’ it wrong
Hopin’ we didn’t get caught


And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the rail road tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago


Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place, she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues ‘bout


And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the rail road tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago

And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the rail road tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago


Well
I'm an eight-ball shooting double fisted drinking son-of-a-gun
I wear my jeans a little tight
Just to watch the little boys come undone

I'm here for the beer
And the ball-busting band
Gonna get a little crazy just because I can


You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leaving till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
You know I'm here
I'm here for the party


I may not be a ten
But the boys say I clean up good
And if I gave 'em half a chance for some rowdy romance
You know they would

I've been waiting all week just to have a good time
So bring on them cowboys
And their pick up lines



[Bridge:
Don't want no purple hooter shooter
Just some Jack on the rocks
Don't mind me if I start that trashy talk



Looks like everybody's here
Had to put some folding chairs in the vestibule
Yeah, it's getting full
Even old Aunt Ruby came
Her first time on an aeroplane, it's her sister's girl
She said she wouldn't miss it for the world

And all them young'uns squirmin' in the pews
Mr. Charlie in his lime green suit is a handsome man
Remarks widow Callahan
Uncle Joe and Uncle Jake
Haven't spoken since '88
Just said Hello
It's a good day to let it go

CHORUS:
So let the angels gather, let the music play
Let the preacher get to preachin' all the do you takes
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limousine
(Two people in)
Love is a beautiful thing

Daddy's waitin' with the bride
As she helps him with his tie she sees a tear
He says it's hot in here
He hugs his little girl and asks
How did you grow up so fast, God I wish
Your Momma could be here for this

Everbody stands and smiles
As she comes walking down the aisle in her momma's gown
And Daddy breaks on down
Gran and Gramps in the second row
Stood right there fifty years ago and said their vows
I guess it's workin' out

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
A little table full of gifts
Catering is coverdish and the wedding band
Well that's on her hand
Tommy's teasing Lorali
Pushed her down and made her cry
And neither one knows a day will come

When the angels gather and the music plays
The preacher gets to preachin' all the do you takes
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of the limousine
Love, two people in Love
It's a beautiful thing

Love, it's a beautiful thing
(Love, it's a beautiful thing)
Love, oh sweet Love, it's a beautiful thing
(Love, it's a beautiful thing)
Love, oh love, it's a beautiful thing
(Love, it's a beautiful thing)
Love, love, it's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
Checking it twice;
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Goodness sake

You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming

(Coming to town)
Santa's a busy man he has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
(Santa Claus is coming to town)
(Coming to town)
(Santa Claus is coming to town)
(Coming to town.)..


On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand, in the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts, breaking necks
When we rolling down the street, heads turning all day when they see you with me
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight


They're like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Aw, baby you look good


Black dress, 2 the 9s, New Year's in a pent
From the floor, to the roof, make the skyline spin
Yeah, you're killing me boy in your black-faded jeans
Ain't gotta work hard when you're smilin' at me


Like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Aw, baby you look good


I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight


They're like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Come on, baby you look good
You look good
Baby, you look good

Try and put your arms around
The 100 year old tree
Climb up on a horse
And let it run full speed
Take a look down at the world from 30,000 feet
On your next flight

Watch a flock of birds
Against the morning sun
Close your eyes and listen
To the river run
Catch a firefly in your hand
Or a raindrop on your tongue
That's right

There is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much proof do you need?

Plant a seed and see
What comes out of the ground
Find the heartbeat on your baby's ultrasound
In a few years hear it laughing
And don't it sound like a song?

Stop and think about
What you don't understand
Things like life and love
And how the world began
Hear the doctor say he can't explain it
But the cancer is gone

There is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much proof do you need?

Science says it's all just circumstance
Like this whole worlds just an accident
But if you want to shoot that theory down
Look around

Just look around

There is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much proof do you need?

Oh there is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much proof do you need?

Walk through this world with me
Go where I go
Share all the dreams with me
I need you so

In life we search
And some of us find
I've looked for you
A long, long time

And now that I've found you
New horizions I see
Come take my hand and
Walk through this world with me

Walk through this world with me
Go where I go
Share all the dreams with me
I've searched for you so

And now that I've found you
New horizions I see
Come take my hand and
Walk through this world with me

Come take my hand and
Walk through this world with me

Breathin' hot an' heavy
Covered up in sweat
I can feel the rhythm
Poundin' in my chest
The atmosphere's electric
Can't you feel the buzz?
Let's get this party started, yeah
Let's crank this number up

(Chorus)
Let's get it on
Do what we came here to do
Rock this town, shake the ground
Get down and raise the roof
Ain't nothin' wrong
With a little cuttin' loose
Next thing you know
The workday blues are gone
C'mon let's get it on

Music's gettin' louder
Smoke's gettin' thick
I can't hear a word she says
But I can read her lips
She's workin' her way closer
Movin' through the crowd
She whispers in my ear:
"It's me an' you, right here, right now"

(Chorus)
Let's get it on
Do what we came here to do
Rock this town, shake the ground
Get down and raise the roof
Ain't nothin' wrong
With a little cuttin' loose
Next thing you know the lovesick blues are gone
C'mon let's get it on

You gotta get up to get down
You gotta get uo to get down
Yeah, you gotta get up to get down
So get up, GET UP, get down!

(Chorus)
Let's get it on
Do what we came here to do
Rock this town, shake the ground
Get down and raise the roof
Ain't nothin' wrong
With a little cuttin' loose
Next thing you know the workday blues are gone
C'mon let's get it on

Let's get it on....


Whatcha got


Quit my job, flipped off the boss, took my name off the payroll, screw you man
Picked up my cell, rang my baby's bell, said I'm three miles from home
I said, "Sugar, won't you put on that sundress I like so much"
Wait out by the road, I'm comin' to pick you up


(Whoa-oh)
Throw your suitcase in the back
(Whoa-oh)
Done gassed up the Pontiac
(Whoa-oh)
Blastin' out to Johnny Cash
Headin' for the highway
Baby we ain't ever comin' back


It's four hundred and sixty-seven miles to the outskirts of Las Vegas
What do you say we go get married by a preacher man who looks like Elvis, yeah Momma
Sugar, don't you worry 'bout tellin' your momma goodbye
We'll send her a souvenir postcard from the wild side


(Whoa-oh)
Throw your suitcase in the back
(Whoa-oh)
Done gassed up the Pontiac
(Whoa-oh)
Blastin' out to Johnny Cash
Headin' for the highway
Baby we ain't ever comin' back




(Whoa-oh)
Throw your suitcase in the back

Na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na na-na-na


It's a long trip alone over sand and stone
That lie along the road that we all must travel down


So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
Cause it's a long trip alone


It's a short piece of time but just enough to find
A little peace of mind under the sun somewhere


So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
Cause it's a long trip alone


And I don't know where I'd be without you here
Cause I'm not really me without you there


Yea Yeah
Hallelujah hallelujah oh


So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
Cause it's a long trip alone


So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
Cause it's a long trip alone


Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!


It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!


When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm


The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!






Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!


There's a trail of smoke coming out of a bottle
If you look real close, you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt
From a few too many beers


We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock


We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world


In that old seashell, you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash
And whisper in your ear
Little glow in the night, it's the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing
Called "Make Me Disappear"


We'll throw the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock


We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world


There ain't no empty glasses
They're playing Drift Away
That's where the magic happens
Back up in that little bay


We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world


To the bar at the end of the world
(We'll set sail)
At the end of the world
(We'll set sail)


I got a death wish
Her looks can kill
She’s got a red dress
Lipstick and heels
Pull me in
Get me hooked like a junkie
You got me feeling so high


You’re such a beautiful drug
I can’t get enough
Addicted and I’m dying for a hit of your love
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don’t want you to save me, save me


She lets her hair down
And all of mine stand up
Can’t help but stare now
Gotta feel that touch
Her kiss, my fix, so sweet
Can’t quit those lips are a habit to me
Sweet intoxication and I’m never getting sober
I can tell that the effects are taking over
Pull me in
Get me hooked like a junkie
You got me feeling so high tonight


You’re such a beautiful drug
I can’t get enough
I’m addicted and dying for a hit of your love
I’m losing it baby
Keep driving me crazy, crazy


Going out of my mind
Staring at you
Burning up in your fire that I’ve fallen into
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don’t want you to save me, save me
Tonight


I can’t sleep
There is no sleep coming
I’m just lying here thinking about you
I’m in deep
Falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything we’re going to do

Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Want to jump in my car, go wherever you are
Because I need you by my side


It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down


I want to see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinning like these wheels in my head tonight


It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down


The only place that I want to be is where you are
Because anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far


It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down


I swear it’s like you’re waiting for the sun to go down
Waiting on the sun to go down
Hey, yeah
Oh, I’m loving thinking about you
I can't sleep, I’m just lying here thinking about you

 - Justin Moore
I could tell by the way you sounded when you called
That I wasn't gonna like what you had to say
I could read between the lines
Somethin' different this time
Your comin' over tonight cause it couldn't wait
Now you're in the drive
I'm a wreck inside as you walk in through that door

 - Justin Moore
You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down
Nice and easy
Think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancin' around what you came here to do
But you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're lookin at me
You look like I need a drink

 - Justin Moore
Been a little over a year since you were standin' right here
And I was nervous for a whole 'nother reason
Now it's a little bit hard bein' this caught off guard
Watchin' you tryin' to not hurt my feelings

 - Justin Moore
You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down
Nice and easy
Think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancin around
What you came here to do but you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're lookin at me
You look like I need a drink
You look like I need a drink

 - Justin Moore
I don't know how this ends
Or where this goes
But the only thing I know is

 - Justin Moore
You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down
Nice and easy
Think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancin' around what you came here to do
But you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're lookin' at me
You look like I need a drink
You look like I need a drink
Yeah, you look like I need a drink right now

 - Justin Moore
Yeah, like I need a drink
A nice stiff drink


I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
A little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine


But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila


I can kiss somebody brand new and not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard


When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila


I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk
And I'm thinking
How I need your love, how I need your love
Yeah, it sinks in


When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila

Lately baby we've been lettin' pride get in the way
Sayin' things that we don't mean, meanin' what we don't say
Things have been so crazy that we lost our peace of mind
But I think I know the perfect place to leave it all behind

Chorus:
They got sunshine every mornin'
They got moonshine every night
They got sweet love flowin' like a river off the mountainside
We're gonna kiss a little, fish a little
Baby, we won't have a care
Plant our feet in the soft green grass
Smack dab, way out, back in the middle of nowhere
I said, the middle of nowhere

Life can get away sometimes before you know it's gone
That solid ground can turn out to be sand you're standin' on
We need a little time to find the fire we once knew
Girl, and paradise is waitin' right down Highway 62

Repeat Chorus

Just you and me, the sky, the lakes and trees
The middle of nowhere
No baby, we won't want to leave - no
That sunshine every mornin'
That moonshine every night
That sweet love flowin' like a river off the mountainside
Yeah, we're gonna kiss a little, fish a little
Baby, we won't have no cares
Plant our feet in the soft green grass
Smack dab, way out, back in

That sunshine every mornin'
That moonshine every night
That sweet love flowin' like a river off the mountainside
We're gonna kiss a little, fish a little
Baby, we won't have a care
Plant our feet in the soft green grass
Smack dab, way out, back in the middle of no, no, no, nowhere
Baby, get in the car
You know it ain't far
To the middle of nowhere


The city’s so in style
All you see for miles are people spilling in and out of cars
Man, I love these bars are making a killin'
Everywhere I go looks like the place to be
I see people that I know and I feel like there’s no one here but me


Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say "hi"
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown’s dead, downtown’s dead


They're dancing in the strobes
Out here in the throws of loud house music
Everything’s a blur
I don’t hear the words, but lips are moving
Try to get involved, but I’ve 'bout had enough of people wall to the wall
And I’m just holdin' it up 'cause...


Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say "hi"
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown’s dead, downtown’s dead


Free drinks, bright lights
What am I doing with my life?
Okay, I quit… I’ve had enough of this
'Cause people are losing their minds
Can’t get you out of my head
I’m calling it a night
I’m crawling back to your bed…


Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say "hi"
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown’s dead, downtown’s dead


Downtown's dead
Downtown's dead


Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio
Just me and you and the man on the moon
Cruisin' down some old back road


Now baby don't you look at me that way
Cause you know there's only so much I can take
Cause you make me want to


Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna

And start over again when the sun comes up

Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol

Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio

She says don't stare at me
She's afraid that I might see
Those 5 extra pounds she talks about
Man, I don't know what she's talking about

She looks through magazines
With every page she dreams of
Looking like somebody else
I wish she wasn't so hard on herself

Then she falls asleep with just my t-shirt on
But even when her hair's messed up and her make-up's gone

Chorus

You can't hide Beautiful
You Can't hide wonderful
There's nothing that she has to do
It just comes natural
She makes it look easy
I love what she does to me
No way to disguise
The way that she shines
You can't hide beautiful, oh no

She can take a simple dress
Put it on and turn some heads
Man Everytime she moves she gets me
She doesn't even know she's sexy

And the way she thinks sometimes
Out of no where blows my mind
She makes me laugh and makes me dream
I love the way she looks at things

A little piece of heaven god gave to this world
She might think she's just an ordinary girl

"But" Repeat Chorus

You can't hide Beautiful
She's so beautiful yeah yeah
Ohhh ohhh ya can't ya can't ya can't hid beautiful


It's 4:30 Friday, I get off at 5:00
I come into your place, you come into mine
Got a bottle of Jack and cheap red wine
Yeah, our own little world
Wanna open em up, close all the doors
Spin you around on that kitchen floor
'Cause all week long, I've been waitin' for
You and me girl


Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend
Sippin' something on the cheap end, cheap end
Skinny dippin' in the deep end, deep end
Or bass fishin' with your feet in, feet in
Up all night then we sleepin', sleepin'
But we were never really sleepin', sleepin'
Tangled up in the sheets in, sheets in
Goose bumps just a creepin', creepin'
Yeah, we chillin' on the weekend
Just chillin' on the weekend


We can watch a whole season of Seinfeld or Friends
While I watch that afternoon sun shining in
Right through the blinds and onto your skin
Yeah, that's something to see
Three days just ain't enough and times ticking
So keep that cherry red lipstick sticking on me
Yeah, let's just keep


Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend
Sippin' something on the cheap end, cheap end
Skinny dippin' in the deep end, deep end
Or bass fishin' with your feet in, feet in
Up all night then we sleepin', sleepin'
But we were never really sleepin', sleepin'
Tangled up in the sheets in, sheets in
Goose bumps just a creepin', creepin'
Yeah, we chillin' on the weekend
Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend


Nothing to do, nowhere to be
Nothing to do, nowhere to be
But right here with you and you with me

Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend
Chillin' on the weekend (Weekend, weekend)


I saw you standing in the middle
Of the thunder and lightning
I know you're feeling like
You just can't win, but you're trying
It's hard to keep on keeping on
When you're being pushed around
Don't even know which way is up
You just keep spinning down, 'round down


Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain


So hold your head up and tell yourself
That there's something more
Walk out that door, go find a new rose
Don't be afraid of the thorns
'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge
Put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down
Keep on remembering


Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain


It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna run out of sting
It's gonna leave you alone
It's gonna set you free, set you free


Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain


It's gonna set you free
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna set you free


Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You're running, you're trying, you're trying to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You'll get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch


He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again, 'cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away-ay-ay
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe, but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice


He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life


Run, run away
Don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart
It's just a matter of time
But just remember


He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life


(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life
(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life

Never thought I'd be in this place
It's someone else's life I'm living
Wish I were living a lie
The hardest part is when the bough breaks
Falling down and then forgiving
You didn't kiss me good-bye
I'm choking on the words I didn't get to say
And pray I get the chance one day

I stil run, I still swing open the door
I still think, you'll be there like before
Doesn't everybody out there know to never come around
Some things the heart won't listen to
I'm still holding out for you

I can hear you smile in the dark
I can even feel your breathing
But daylight chases the ghosts
I see your coat and I fall apart
To those hints of you I'm clinging
Now's when I need them most
I should get up, dry my eyes and move ahead
At least that's what you would have said

I stil run, I still swing open the door
I still think, you'll be there like before
Doesn't everybody out there know to never come around
Some things the heart won't listen to
I'm still holding out for you

Faithfully, I trace your name while you sleep
It's the the only true comfort I feel

I still run, I still swing open the door
I still think, you'll be there like before

I stil run, I still swing open the door
I still think, you'll be there like before
Doesn't everybody out there know to never come around
Some things the heart won't listen to
I'm still holding out for you


I packed a cooler and a change of clothes
Let's jump in, see how far it goes
You got my heart in your daddy's boat
We've got all night to make it float
We could sit on the shore
We could just be friends
Or we could jump in


The whole world could change in a minute
Just one kiss could stop it spinning
We could think it through
But i don't want to, if you don't want to
We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came
With nothing to lose
But i don't want to, if you don't want to


I got your ring around my neck
And a couple of nights i don't regret
You've got a dream of a degree and a shirt that smells like me
Yeah we both got dreams
We could chase alone
Or we could make our own


The whole world could change in a minute
Just one kiss could stop it spinning
We could think it through
But i don't want to, if you don't want to
We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came
With nothing to lose
But i don't want to, if you don't want to


Never waste another day wondering what you threw away
Holding me, holding you
I don't want to, if you don't want to


We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came with nothing to lose
But i don't want to, if you don't want to
But i want to
But i want you


Saturday night and a six pack, girl
Big star shining on a small town world
It's a helluva life, it's a helluva life
And KC lights on a dirt road dance
You take that kiss just as far as you can
It's a helluva life, oh it's a helluva life


And pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin'
To a song that's playing on the radio station
Bad times make the good times better
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever
On a helluva ride
Yeah, it's a helluva life
It's a helluva life


And we all have faith, and we all have hope
But we're all a little lost in the same damn boat
It's a helluva life, yeah it's a helluva life
Something 'bout the night girl
When you got the right girl
Sitting right beside you
Looking at the sky, girl
Thinking 'bout why we're here
And where we're going
Baby, here we are
And all I know is


Pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin'
To a song that's playing, the world starts fadin'
Bad times make the good times better
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever
On a helluva ride
Yeah, it's a helluva life
It's a helluva life


Something 'bout the night, girl
When you got the right, girl
Sitting right beside you
Looking at the sky, girl
Thinking 'bout why we're here
And where we're going
Baby, here we are
And all I know is


Pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin'
To a song that's playing, it's the perfect combination
Bad times make the good times better
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever
On a heavenly ride
Yeah, it's a helluva life
It's a helluva life


Bad times make the good times better
Aw, one helluva life
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever
It's a helluva life
Yeah, it's a helluva life
It's a helluva life


Well I drove down to the ocean
Left my heartache way behind
But the rain won't leave and the pain won't ease
And the sun don't wanna shine
So I ordered me up a killer
Found a view out across the sea
I sat down in the sand
A drink in my hand
And in the glass looking back at me


I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go
Yeah, I got a long, long way to go


Well I met an old boy from Georgia
Yeah, his woman done knocked him down
I asked him how's he doing
He stared at me confused
And said, "Hey, ain't you looked around?"
He said the rain won't leave
And the pain won't ease
And the sun don't wanna shine
And there's something in the bottom of this drink I just got
And it don't look like a worm to me


I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go
Yeah, I got a long, long way to go


So we put our drinks together
And toasted rainy weather
And the women that had done us wrong
Then we threw back margaritas
The bug just made it sweeter
And we both sang a happy song


Yeah, I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go

Verse1:
How do I brake it to my heart
That it's gotta get over you
How do I learn to live apart
From the one I gave my life to
Well right here, right now
Let it turn me inside out
So I can just move on

Chorus:
So bring on the pain
Let it kill your memory
Bring on the rain
Let it drown what's left of you and me
I know the only way I'm ever gonna make it
Is burying the best of us
Even though it's killing me
Cause I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore

Verse 2:
How will I learn to trust again
If I can't forget you
How will I let a new love in
If I'm still holdin onto
All these angry tears
And those wasted years
The only way I'll ever let em go

Chorus:
Is to bring on the pain
Let it kill your memory
Bring on the rain
Let it drown what's left of you and me
I know the only way I'm ever gonna make it
Is burying the best of us
Even though it's killing me
Cause I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore

Repeat Chorus

I had to escape, the city was getting too cruel
Maybe I should have called you first, but I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming as I drove the long straight road ahead
The taste of your kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright, I drove all night
Crept in your room, to wake you from your sleep
To make love to you, I drove all night

What in the world keeps us from tearing apart
No matter where I go I hear your voice inside my heart
It's calling me home, pulling me through the dark
Nothing can move me the way that you do
It reaches across any distance between me and you

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright, I drove all night
Crept in your room, to wake you from your sleep
To make love to you, is that alright
I drove all night
I drove all night
I drove all night
I drove all night

Well it's Friday evening, six o'clock
And all my friends are twisting off
I'm at the house just turning on TV
And they all wonder why I've changed
How many times must I explain
It's basic honky-tonk anatomy

The drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone

Hey two plus two is always four
And down is south and up is north
Thirty-two degrees is freezing cold
You play with fire, you wind up burned
The early bird gets the worm
But the only thing you really need to know

Is the drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone

Yeah now sing it with me
Let's make sure you know

The drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the...
Drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone


Just a small town Cinderella
Daddy wants you back home by midnight
Every time we're together
Yeah that's my dilemma
I need more time with you
I wanna watch the sun
Rise through the pines with you


Night like this, wouldn't wanna' miss
Moonlight shining on a long slow kiss
You could be the one, I could get lucky with
If the boot fits


Woah, diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah, you're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits


Yeah, baby, we can run away
My carriage is a 4x4 400-horse Chevrolet
You're like a princess
In a blue cotton dress
I can be your prince
If the boot fits


Woah, diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah, you're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits


Woah
Let me show a country boy treats a lady
Woah
Go ahead kick 'em off cos the boot fits lady


Woah, diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah, you're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits
Woah, if the boot fits
Yeah, if the boot fits


She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', "no way she ain't got one"
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off


She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here, boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"


I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up


She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"


And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar


She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"


Yeah play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again

She's a little complicated
She'll make her mind up just to change it
The kind of girl that keeps you waitin', waitin' around
She likes to get her toes done bright red
She's always reapplying her lipstick
The muddy river bank shes the first in and last out
She's got something I can't figure out
That everybody's talking about

Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sunny one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want I want whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

Tell your mind before you thought it
What you thought your plan was park it
To figure out where your heart is so twisted up
Have you spendin' every weekend
And every penny you've been keepin'
Just to figure out what she's thinkin' when you're thinkin' it's love

Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sunny one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want I want whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

She's got me hangin' on the ledge
On the edge of a kiss
All I ever wanna do is this

She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want


Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sunny one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want I want whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

She's a little bit complicated
That's alright
Doesn't matter I'll keep on waiting
For whatever she's got
For whatever she's got

Life’s tough and then you die
And there ain’t no rhyme or reason why
It comes right at you so you do what you do

Love’s great until it’s not
Hearts break but the world don’t stop
When it rains, man, it pours you can’t change the course
You can wish on a star but if it ain’t in the cards

Let it go, sometimes you gotta let it go
Let it all wash on under the bridge, blow it a kiss
Give it a rest ‘cause it is what it is

Time flies while you save it all up
But someday this’ll all be dust
It’s all just stuff, it ain’t ever enough
And you can’t take it with you so you might as well just

Let it go, yeah you really oughta let it go
Let it all wash on under the bridge, blow it a kiss
Give it a rest ‘cause it is what it is

You never know
What’s waiting just up the road
Sooner or later that sun’s gonna shine
Luck will turn on a dime
So when the good times roll let ‘em roll
But when they don’t
Let it go

Move on, keep moving ‘til you see the light
The one that you’ve been waiting on
Shining bright in the night
Saying hey there friend where the hell have you been

Let it go, you really gotta let it go
Let it all wash on under the bridge, blow it a kiss
Give it a rest ‘cause it is what it is

You never know
What’s waiting just up the road
Sooner or later that sun’s gonna shine
Luck will turn on a dime
And when the good times roll let ‘em roll
But when they don’t
Let it go

Let it go
You really gotta let it go
Let it go
Sometimes you gotta let it go
Let it go
You really oughta let it go
Let it go

We've been waiting all week
Been waiting on the weekend
To crawl out of the shadows
With the ones your mama said run from

The ones your daddy kept you from
Now we're all on the loose
And we are here

Everybody raise your glass
(Hey, hey, hey)
Pick it up and throw it back
Grab ahold of your honey
And everybody get a little lovin'
A little touchin'
A little kissin' and a huggin'
Do a little lovin'
Touchin'
A little kissin' and a huggin'

Cause we don't need no sleep tonight
Everybody's bumpin' to the beat just right
We'll worry 'bout tomorrow when tomorrow comes
Tonight we're just worried about having fun
Cause we're the wild ones, yeah
You know that we're the wild ones

We're gonna always do it our way
And we don't care what nobody say
Cause we're the wildcats
We're the fighters
We're the midnight up all nighters

Everybody raise your glass
(Hey, hey, hey)
Pick it up and throw it back
Grab ahold of your honey
And everybody get a little lovin'
A little touchin'
A little kissin' and a huggin'
Do a little lovin'
Touchin'
A little kissin' and a huggin'

Cause we don't need no sleep tonight
Everybody's bumpin' to the beat just right
We'll worry 'bout tomorrow when tomorrow comes
Tonight we're just worried about having fun
Cause we're the wild ones, yeah
We're the wild ones

Everybody get a little lovin'

Cause we don't need no sleep tonight
Everybody's bumpin' to the beat just right
We'll worry 'bout tomorrow when tomorrow comes
Tonight we're just worried about having fun
Cause we're the wild ones


You could say I'm a little bit crazy
You could call me insane
Walking around with all these whispers
Running around here in my brain
I just can't help but hear 'em
Man, I can't avoid it, I hear voices
I hear voices


Like, my dad saying work that job
But don't work your life away
And momma telling me to drop some cash
Into the offering plate on Sunday
And Granddad saying you can have a few
But don't ever cross that line
Yeah, I hear voices all the time


Turns out I'm pretty dang lucky
For all that good advice
Those hard to find words of wisdom
Hold up here in my life
And just when I lost my way
Or I got too many choices, I hear voices
I hear voices


Like, my dad saying quit that team
And you'll be a quitter for the rest of your life
And Momma telling me to say a prayer
Every time I lay down at night
And Grandma saying if you find the one
You better treat her right
Yeah, I hear voices all the time


Sometimes I try to ignore them
But I thank God for them
'Cause they made me who I am


My dad saying work that job
But don't work your life away
And Momma telling me to drop some cash
In the offering plate on Sunday
And Granddad saying you can have a few
But don't ever cross that line
Yeah, I hear voices all the time


Yeah, I hear voices all the time
All the time


Well it's hotter than hell outside right now
It's 100 in the shade with the sun beating down
Forecast calling for some more of the same
Well I can't fix that but I can fix a drink


I turn on Fox news and then CNN
But it's the same dang thing all over again
The world's in the toilet and the market's in the tank
Well I can't fix that, no


But I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get'cha feeling right
I can get'cha buzzed, I can get'cha smiling
I can make you feel like you're sitting on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
Tell me what you think, yeah
I can fix a drink


Say you gotta broken phone and a broken heart
The boss is on your back and your truck won't start
None of your friends want to listen to Hank
Well I can't fix that, no


But I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get'cha feeling right
I can get'cha buzzed, I can get'cha smiling
I can make you feel like you're sitting on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
Tell me what you think, yeah
I can fix a drink


I don't know what's going on with you
But if you got some cheap whisky and some Mountain Dew
Malibu, Cuervo, Coke in a cup
Brother I can hook you up


But I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get'cha feeling right
I can get'cha buzzed, I can get'cha smiling
I can make you feel like you're sitting on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
Tell me what you think, yeah
I can fix a drink
Yeah, I can fix a drink

When I was only seventeen, couldn't wait for twenty one
I'd hang around on Clayton Street in the bars there gettin' drunk
A baseball cap and a fake ID would get me in the clubs
Then I would dance with the college girls and lie about who I was
I'd say "I'm pre-Med. here at UGA, live on Milledge Avenue
I was raised over in Buckhead, I drive a BMW."

I was breakin' hearts and takin' names and numbers just for fun
Stealin' kisses wishin' I was twenty one

When Thursdays came and pocket change would quickly disappear
Upstairs at Lowry's Tavern, we'd pay a nickel for every beer
Shootin' pool, smokin' cigarettes with a dizzy head and a grin
Four A.M. on a school night, still hangin' out with my friends
One hour's sleep on a dirty couch, no shower, off to school
Smellin' just like a brewery with a bad hangover too

The teachers all would hassle me: "Stay awake, pay attention"
I was catchin' hell, wishin' I was twenty one

The youngest one of all my friends, I didn't act my age
Too cool for the football games and the homecoming parades

Now I look back and I have to smile, cause boy it was fun
Bein' seventeen, wishin' I was twenty one

Now I'm only twenty six, feelin' more like fourty three
My hairline's disappearing, and I never get ID'd
My clothes are out of fashion, no I'm not cool anymore
In the bed by ten o'clock each night, and up at half-past four
Still I go down to that college town when the Bulldogs play at home
I drink keg beer from a trash can til the whole damn thing is gone

Then I look at all those college girls so innocent and young
And I just check 'em out, and say "Damn... I wish I was twenty one"


Another Friday night there's a line of cars leavin'
Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sittin' on the hood of mine drinkin'
I'm just a parkin' lot down-and-outer


Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on savin' me


Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and


Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz


I never had big-city eyes
Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace


No, Scotty's ain't got no vibe
Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight


Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz




Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down here
Is lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz


I catch me a 'round here buzz
'Round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz

Long about midnight
Up on Chigger Hill
Making mischief in the moonlight
Just looking for a thrill
Then the lights are coming on and they're flashing blue
And they're running and they're gunning after you-know-who
Grinding out the gears in my pickup truck
Trying to get away so we dont get busted

CHORUS:
Flying 90 miles an hour
Like a wild bat out of hell
(singing) hallelujah with a rebel yell
Dancing with a little danger
Fast and hard I'm gonna ride
Praying I'm just gonna make it out alive
Good lord willing and the creek don't rise
Good lord willing and the creek don't rise

Long about sunrise
Cuddled up with Audra May
She never said she had a boyfriend
Oh boy, it's me who's going to pay
Cause he's standing out the window and he's fighting mad
Looking like I might have stolen everything he had
Red-faced, cussing, yeah he's blowing a fuse
Tough luck brother, when you snooze you lose




Good lord willing and the creek don't rise
Good lord willing and the creek don't rise
Good lord willing and the creek don't rise
Good lord willing and the creek don't rise


Now I grew up down an old dirt road, in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks, back in nineteen sixty-four
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day he'd put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man, and the whiskey's known to change a man


But, that's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go, in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be


Now it's been twelve years since I sold my soul, to the devil in L.A
He said sign your name here on the dotted line, and your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said, "You wanna sell a million records, boy? You better listen to me."


He said, "Change your style, whiten your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life, you'd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around?"


I said, no that's not me
'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy, is all I'll ever be

'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty-five
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck, and my idea of heaven's chasin' white tail bucks
And as a country boy, I know I can survive


Now two flags fly above my land, and really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue
The other one's got a rattlesnake, with a simple statement made
"Don't tread on me" is what it says, and I'll take that to my grave


Because, this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause my family's always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be


I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family, I love the way it is now
And anybody that tries to change it, has to come through me
That should be all of our attitudes, 'cause this is America, and a country boy is good enough for me, son

I've got a friend who wears go-go boots to Sunday School
We used to sit and drink pink champagne on a tin roof
Ridin' it out in a Thunderbird
Singin' out loud every single word of Jack & Diane
Tryin' to pretend there was no rules
Kissin' on boys and sneakin' in bars
Tryin' to get a glimpse of who we are
We weren't wild, but we weren't far

She said Thelma and Louise, you got nothin' on me
And you can tell ol' James Dean to get in line
Thanks to Elvis and Kurt Cobain, the world will never be the same
You gotta make history one day at a time

She graduated in 1987
We were gonna make a break for it together
Headed out to Hollywood
Where the stars are bright and the weather's good
But she changed her mind and went back to the 7-11
She went and married the football star
Had few kids and works real hard
It ain't wild but it ain't far

(Repeat Chorus)
Hey, Thelma and Louise, you got nothin' on me
And you can tell ol' James Dean to get in line
Thanks to Jesus and John Wayne the world will never be the same
You've gotta make history one day at a time

Like John Lennon and Kennedy
I'm with them, yeah, 'cause I believe
You gotta make history one day at a time

You gotta know I don't blame you
So don't you go blaming yourself
As easy as these things get started
There's really no way to tell
Just how far it will go
And just how strong it can get
Yea, sometimes the love ends up one sided
But there's nothing ‘bout you I regret

So don't worry bout me
Don't lose sleep
Don't come savin' me
‘Cuz the water here's too deep
I wouldn't want you to suffer
Like I have
Oh no, I don't love you like that

I want you to find what you're needing
More than I want you to stay
I wish you could feel what I'm feeling
But I don't want you hurtin' that way
‘Cuz there are two kinds of love in this world
The selfish kind - it never wins
And as hard as it is letting go now
It would kill me to watch you pretend

So don't worry ‘bout me
Don't lose sleep
Don't come savin' me ‘cuz the water here's too deep
I wouldn't want you to suffer
Like I have
Oh no, I don't love you like that

So don't worry ‘bout me
Don't lose sleep
Don't come saving me ‘cuz the water here's too deep
I wouldn't want you to suffer
Like I have
Oh no, I don't love you like that

Don't worry bout me
Don't lose sleep
Don't come savin' me ‘cuz the water here's too deep

Don't suffer
Like I have
Oh no, I don't love you like that
I don't love you like that
I don't love you like that
I don't love you like that


Girl when I look at you, you look through me
Like I'm not even there
I try not to give up, to be strong but
I'm afraid to say I'm scared
I can't find the place, your heart is hidin'
I'm no quitter but I'm tired of fightin'


Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me


What if when I'm long gone, it dawns on you
You just might want me back
Let me make myself clear, if I leave here
It's done; I'm gone, that's that
You carry my love around
Like it's a heavy burden
Well I'm about to take it back
Are you sure it's worth it


Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
Don't make me (Don't make me)


Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me


(Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go)
Don't make me
Stop lovin' you
(Don't make me)
Stop needin' you

The glasses were all plastic;
Little balls of no-name soap;
No cable on the TV;
The ice-machine was broke
Well, I guess that's what you get
For nineteen bucks an' some change
But the cheapest motel in town
Cost him everything

They used the Bible for a coaster
An' it never crossed their mind:
Maybe they should've opened it
Instead of that high-dollar wine
It was just their little secret
A hideaway out West Main
But the cheapest motel in town
Cost him everything

He went from home in the suburbs
To an apartment in town
From bein' met at the door by two little kids
To a stray dog he'd found
He paid the price for pleasure

Now he can't afford the pain
An' the cheapest motel in town
Cost him everything

They thought no-one would find 'em
But it isn't hard to spot
A brand-new black Mercedes-Benz
In that gravel parkin' lot
He fooled his wife till one night
She saw something he couldn't explain
An' the cheapest motel in town
Cost him everything

He went from home in the suburbs
To an apartment in town
From bein' met at the door by two little kids
To a stray dog he'd found
He paid the price for pleasure
Now he can't afford the pain
Yeah, the cheapest motel in town
Cost him everything;
It cost him everything;
Cost him everything


I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die


So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine


I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall


And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye


So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine


I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time


I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand


But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine


I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time


All the time


Little footprints in the dust on the dashboard
Radio still stuck on your station
Still taste your kiss from this mornin'
Girl you say there's another one waiting
Hope it's a long one, break of the dawn one
I want everyone you got


Give me that "Let's get out of here go jump in the river"
Girl, show me what that rockin' body looks like in the firelight
Wrap me up with all that love that you been holding back your whole life
Girl I wish you would just hit me with that
Pretty little get me through tomorrow smile
Bring on all the good with all the bad I'm all about it
Anything and everything, baby you could never bring enough of it
I want all of it


I wanna see you all city light lit up
I wanna see you in a pair of cut-up jeans
I wanna fall for all your magic
Feel all your teardrops drippin' on me
The sad ones, the happy ones
I want everyone you got


Give me that "Let's get out of here go jump in the river"
Girl, show me what that rockin' body looks like in the firelight
Wrap me up with all that love that you been holding back your whole life
Girl I wish you would just hit me with that
Pretty little get me through tomorrow smile
Bring on all the good with all the bad I'm all about it
Anything and everything baby you could never bring enough of it
Yeah, I want all of it


Baby, I want all of it
All the time
Everything you got I wanna make all mine


Give me that "Let's get out of here go jump in the river"
Girl, show me what that rockin' body looks like in the firelight
Wrap me up with all that love that you been holding back your whole life
Girl I wish you would just hit me with that
Pretty little get me through tomorrow smile
Bring on all the good with all the bad I'm all about it
Anything and everything baby you could never bring enough of it
I want all of it

(I want all of it)


I got a six pack, got a single stem rose
My baby's dressed up she's raring to go
I got a Jones for the moon and the jukebox
I like to two step she likes to rock
That clock on the wall it rings, it chimes
It's beer thirty, a honky tonk time


Life's too short, let's get to living it
Let's give it all we can give it
Let your hair down, turn the music up
We going to paint the town flat, tear it up
The party starts here get in line
Beer thirty a honky tonk time


I put in my four day
I'm going home
Lord my get-up has got up and gone
Got my pay check I'm on my way
It's finally Friday my kind of day
I punch the clock, I hit the road flying
It's beer thirty, a honky tonk time



This woman that takes on the world
And picks up you shirts, keeps it together somehow
This same woman, that melts with your touch
Wants you to feel what I'm feelin right now

Chorus
'Cause this woman needs
A safe place to land
The strength in your hands
To know you know
What this woman needs
Is somewhere to cry
So lay by my side
And I'll tell you, I'll tell you

This woman needs to be reassured
That my heart's your home and love is what wills you to stay
I need you to see me in every light
And hear that you still think I'm beautiful anyway

(Repeat Chorus)
What this woman needs
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, what this woman needs
Is somewhere to cry
So lay by my side
And I'll tell you, I'll tell you

What this woman needs
Yeah, what this woman needs
Yeah, yeah, yeah -
What this woman needs


Girl, it's high time I tell ya
No more messin' around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out
I'm talkin' you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'm a go on and take a swing


You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah


You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch a sunset from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watchin' way more than the garden grow


You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs


Yeah, layin' next to you every night
Sounds like a damn good life


You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs


Yeah, I'll name the dogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs

I've traveled 'round the world in airplanes and in cars
I've tried exotic foods and smoked some fine cigars

I'm just a girl, an American girl
I'm just a girl, but I'm not an ordinary girl
I'm a Chevy girl

I've strolled down Paris streets, been lost in London fog
But all I really need are the fields of Arkansas

I'm just a girl, an American girl
I'm just a girl, but I'm not an ordinary girl
I need an old Corvette with the top down
And a backseat for my friends
I need baseball and apple pie to feel alive
Gimme a Coca-Cola sundae and a Beach Boys serenade
I need freedom to be all around the world
I'm a Southern girl

I want an old porch swing under Montana skies
To hold a working man, looking good in his old Levis

I'm just a girl, an American girl
I'm just a girl, but I'm not an ordinary girl

I need an old Corvette with the top down
And a backseat for my friends
I need baseball and apple pie to feel alive
Gimme a Coca-Cola sundae and a Beach Boys serenade
I need freedom to be all around the world
I'm a daddy's girl

I've traveled 'round this world and I'm ready to go home


Rifle in a gun rack hanging in the back glass
Buck knife on my belt, ain't no land for sale 'round here
Red clay country mud, sipping on a cold Bud
Blue tick coon hound you know where I'm found


Out in the backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, working hard for a dollar in the
Backwoods yeah we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, yes sir


Preacher's daughter couldn't get hotter
Floating that river on an inner tube with her, splash
35's and a lift kit how stuck can you get
Ain't that just my luck where's the chain I'm stuck


Out in the backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, working hard for a dollar In the Backwoods yeah we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, yes sir

Out in the backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, working hard for a dollar In the Backwoods yeah we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, down in the holler son
Down in the backwoods

What makes you hurt
What makes you smile
Calms your nerves
What drives you wild
I wanna know
I wanna understand
What it takes to be your man

What's your favorite color
What's your favorite song
If I sang it to you would you sing along?
I need to know
I gotta understand
What it takes to be your man

What you want
What you need
Baby tell me everything
There ain't nothin' I don't wanna know
'Cause all I want, all I need is just you here with me
Baby let me know so that I can be what it takes to be your man

What makes you cuss
When do you pray
Is your Daddy your hero
What would your Momma say 'bout what I need to know
I need to understand
What it takes to be your man....

What you want
What you need
Baby tell me everything
There ain't nothin' I don't wanna know
'Cause all I want, all I need is just you here with me
Baby let me know so that I can be what it takes to be your man

What you want
What you need
Baby tell me everything
There ain't nothin' I don't wanna know
'Cause all I want, all I need is just you here with me
Baby let me know so that I can be what it takes to be your man

Ohhh

I'm not your high school crush
Your first love, your first kiss
Guy that crossed you off of his list
I'm not the red taillights that left you behind
Again and again

I'm not your Tennessee pre-med big man
Promised you a ring and took another girl's hand
What's it gonna take to make you understand
I'm not that man

This is me now
Baby, don't doubt
The love I can give to you
You gotta know

I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now

Girl, after all you've been through
I knew it'd be a matter of time
'Til all those goodbyes made you mine

I've been your late night call
Your shoulder to cry on
Out on the highway, listening to sad songs
Talk all night 'bout stupid things, makin' you smile

I've been right here
All of these years
I am your man
By now you ought to know

I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now

Girl, after all you've been through
I knew it'd be a matter of time
'Til all those goodbyes made you mine

No more lonely nights
Starin' at your cell phone
No more clinging to a love so cold
With me you'll never have to be alone

I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now

Girl, after all you've been through
I knew it'd be a matter of time
'Til all those goodbyes made you mine
Goodbyes made you mine

I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now

Girl, after all you've been through
I knew it'd be a matter of time
'Til all those goodbyes made you mine
Goodbyes made you mine


Remember
How he told you you were stupid
How he couldn't even look at you anymore
Remember
How he told you you were crazy
How he got out of the car and slammed the door


He said "You can't do anything right
Why you gotta make me so mad?
Just get outta my sight"
Remember that


When it's 3AM and he's at your door
And he wants you back and he's begging for forgiveness
Remember that
When your phone keeps ringing all night long
And that same old weakness gets so strong that you're helpless
Remember that


Remember
How he pushed you in the hallway
Just enough to hurt a little bit
Remember
The whiskey in his whispers
And the lies that fell so easy from his lips


He said he'll never do it again
But you can't take it back
The proof is on your skin
Remember that


When it's 3AM and he's at your door
And he wants you back and he's begging for forgiveness
Remember that
When your phone keeps ringing all night long
And that same old weakness gets so strong that you're helpless
Remember that


It doesn't matter how he hurts you
With his hands or with his words
You don't deserve it, it ain't worth it
Take your heart and run


When it's 3AM and he's at your door
And he wants you back and he's begging for forgiveness
Remember that
When your phone keeps ringing all night long
And that same old weakness gets so strong that you're helpless
Remember that


Remember
You're gonna be alright
Take it from me, I've stood there in your shoes

I used to be crazy, yeah, they called me a fool
Guess I wasn't myself back when I wanted you
Now youre comin round again, that same old look in your eye
Yea Id have to be crazy to fall again

Im gonna break these chains around my broken heart
You could have had it once, but you tore it all apart
Im gonna throw your lyin eyes over my left shoulder
Im not gonna let you wear your crown
This time around

I can't stay any longer
I gotta be on my way
Ive heard a thousand times
Everything that you gotta say

Show myself to the door
Ill turn out your light
Get back in my car
Youll be alone again tonight

Im gonna break these chains around my broken heart
You could have had it once, but you tore it all apart
Im gonna throw your lyin eyes over my left shoulder
Im not gonna let you wear your crown
This time around

Never thought Id be so cold
What did you expect me to do
I can't put it all on hold
I learned it all from you

Im gonna break these chains around my broken heart
You could have had it once, but you tore it all apart
Im gonna throw your lyin eyes over my left shoulder
Im not gonna let you wear your crown
This time around

Not this time around


I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
I had a job and I lost it
But it won't get to me

Because I'm riding with my baby
And it's a brand new day
We're on the wheels of an angel
Flying away


And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me


Now she's strumming on my six-string
Across her pretty knees
She's stomping out a rhythm
And singing to me the sweetest song


And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me
And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me


I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
We're on the wheels of an angel
And I'm free
She's strumming on my six-string
It's across her pretty knees
She's stomping out a rhythm
And she's singin' to me

Caught in the downpour of a rain of stones
Felt like an exile in the world I had known
So I sought the shelter of my own soul and stayed inside
Words that were sharper then the winter wind
No longer had the power to pierce my skin
And they may not stop but I won't take them in
And I won't hide

I will be here
I will be strong
I'll face my fears

When the night is long
And still go on
I will be brave
I will be bold
Follow my faith
To a higher road
And I'm not there yet
But I will be

I could choose to keep my feet upon the narrow path
Never cross the open field for that one snake in the grass
But I'd rather risk my heart than never get the chance
To find my way

I will be here
I will be strong
I'll face my fears


I'm a few drinks in, but that ain't the reason
I'm all tongue tied and my breath's leaving this fast
I can't get past those blue eyes shining
They keep drawing me in to you
Got me fallin' off track
You get me like that


Yeah I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me


It ain't the song, and it ain't the playlist
It's every smile coming off of your sweet lips, yeah
That makes me wanna stay here
No, this ain't a one night, one time thing
You always light me up like a flame and it's clear
Every time you're near


Yeah I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me
Yeah, you hangin' on to me


So let me pull you a little closer
Even when the music's over


I'll be hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me
Yeah, you hangin' on to me


My friends say they're proud of me
For taking our breakup so casually
But they don't see what lies beneath my smile
It appears that I'm okay
And I moved on when you walked away
But the truth is since you said goodbye


I'm invisibly shaken and quietly breakin'
Desperately takin' one breath at a time
Beneath this composure I know it's over
Baby I'm dying cause you can't be mine
But I will never show the toll it's taking
Cause I'm invisibly shaken


If it looks like I don't care
It's not killing me seeing you here
And hearing you say you want to try us again
Believe me it ain't easy being this cool
But too many times girl I've been your fool
And I know I'd just end up here again




Baby I'm dying cause you can't be mine
But I will never show the toll it's taking
Cause I'm invisibly shaken


I ain't complaining
But I'm tired, so I'm just saying
What I think
And if we're being honest
Than honestly I think I need a drink
My baby's growing up
She think's she's falling all in love
And that I hate her
At seventeen, she's just like me when I was seventeen
So I don't blame her


Do do do do
Do do do do
What are we going to do ?


Remember when we use to be
Everything they ever need
We had them believing we were cool
It's like it happened over night
We're always wrong, their always right
We use to be the one's breaking the rules
Now we're just mothers, we're just fathers of
Teenage Daughters


She rolls her eye's when I'm funny
But she's sweet when she wants money and her freedom
Oh my god, she's got a car
Swears they won't go far
And i wish i believed I am






Their beautiful, wild and free
Everything we wish we could be
But their still crazy
Oh you know, the make us crazy




Yeah Teenage Daughters
I ain't complaining
But I'm just tired, so I'm saying
What I think
If we're being honest
Than honestly, I think I need a drink


Girls in bikinis, bikinis
(Gimme, gimme)
Girls in bikinis
(Gimme, gimme)


Watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
Can't help but stare
They do the shimmy out of them cut-offs
Lay a towel down, and they look around
They ride up, they pull em out
Don't try to act like you don't know what I'm talking about


Camo, canary yellow, red white and blue
High-five to the guy who thought about cutting that thing in two
String around her neck or without a strap
Laying on their bellies, untied off their backs
Watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
Can't help but stare
(Gimme, gimme)
Girls in bikinis
(Gimme, gimme)


Tie-dyed or polka-dot, coconut, muffin top, there in the sand, with a beer in her hand
They pop out, they put em back in
Covered up just enough not to be a sin


Camo, canary yellow, red white and blue
High-five to the guy who thought about cutting that thing in two
String around her neck or without a strap
Laying on their bellies, untied off their backs

Jumping in the water (Haha)
Coming out the water (Hey boy)

Feel that salt in the air, almost there
Got that wind in my hair, Ray-Ban glare
Hear that song we love on the radio
Stir it up baby, we both know


We’re ‘bout to float that Malibu
With that flip-flop attitude
With that old school mixtape playing


Over and over again on a blown out speaker
Dance in the sand while the sun sets deeper
Got that top back on that Jeep
Got that soundtrack on repeat
Got that one hand on my knee and I want it
Over and over again, catching summer fever
Summer fever, summer fever


Close our eyes and let it take us
Lost in the waves and the palm trees swaying
All alone and out of reach
Just the stars and the moonlight, you and me


We’re ‘bout to float that Malibu
With that barefoot attitude
With that slow jam mixtape playing


Over and over again on a blown out speaker
Dance in the sand while the sun sets deeper
Got that top back on that Jeep
Got that soundtrack on repeat
Got that one hand on my knee and I want it
Over and over again, catching summer fever
Summer fever, summer fever


Endless sun kissed smile on our face
Chase that love like it’s running away
And I want it
Yeah I want it
Ohh


Over and over again on a blown out speaker
Dance in the sand while the sun sets deeper
Got that top back on that Jeep
Got that soundtrack on repeat
Got that one hand on my knee and I want it
Over and over again catching summer fever, summer fever, summer fever


Over and over again, catching summer fever
Summer fever, summer fever

He was glued to the TV
When she asked him for the keys
Said, "I'm going to the market Is there anything you need?"
The first quarter was underway
He never missed a play

She pulled out of the driveway
Took a left at the light
Didn't stop at the market
She just drove right on by
Across the railroad tracks
She never once looked back

She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
He doesn't even know it yet
But she's gone
As far away as she can get
Passed the point of no regret
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on

Half time is over
The sun is sinking low
It's almost time for supper
But there's nothing on the stove
He looks up from his easy chair
He just noticed she's not there

She made a stop at the bank
Took out some cash
Now she's racing down the highway
On a full tank of gas
As fast as she can go
To where she doesn't know

She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
He doesn't even know it yet
But she's gone
As far away as she can get
Passed the point of no regret
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
She went out for cigarettes
And drove on


Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me
You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it down for someone else
Cause loving him you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby can't you see
That he's
Not me


And I need you
To know you can
Fall into me
That my arms
Are wide open and
Will always be
Right here waiting
Staying strong

Anywhere to get to you

If that's what you need me to do
Now baby it's your move
All you got to do is believe
In love
Just believe
In us




Just believe in love
Just believe in us


Baby I need you
To know you can
Fall into me
That my arms
Are wide open and
Will always be
Right here waiting
Staying strong

(Let’s do it again!)


I pinch myself
Sometimes to make sure I'm not in a dream
That's how it seems
I close my eyes and breathe in the sweetest moments I've ever known
It feels like home
And here I am
I want to be your everything
There you are
Turning winter into spring


And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After take years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
Yeah
I just call you mine


I fall apart
And just a word from you
Somehow seems to fix
Whatever's wrong
Oh
You reach into the weakest moments and remind me that I'm strong
You got to know
I'd be a fool not to see or even worse to forget
That you're more than I deserve




Nothing makes sense when you're not here
As if my whole world disappears
Without you what's the point of it




Been sittin' here tippin' back Crown straight
Workin' up the nerve and the words to say
To turn those eyes and that smile my way
No time to waste
'Cause you showed up and all eyes on you
Shinin' like a diamond in a neon room
Every guy here wants to make a move
I better make a move


Somebody else will if I don't
Walk up and ask you your name right now
Offer to buy you a drink
Sit down and tell you your looks could kill
Somebody else will if I don't
Take a chance on your lips
Lean in slowly stealin' your kiss like this
Makin' your world stand still
Somebody else will
Somebody else will


Maybe you're a little bit west coast
Maybe you're a little bit down home
Either way girl I just gotta know
I just gotta know


'Cause somebody else will if I don't
Walk up and ask you your name right now
Offer to buy you a drink
Sit down and tell you your looks could kill
Somebody else will if I don't
Take a chance on your lips
Lean in slowly stealin' your kiss like this
Makin' your world stand still
Somebody else is gonna hold you
Somebody gonna get to know you
If I don't get there and sweep you off your feet
Girl somebody else will
Ohh somebody else will


Somebody else will if I don't
Walk up and ask you your name right now
Offer to buy you a drink
Sit down and tell you your looks could kill
Somebody else will if I don't
Take a chance on your lips
Lean in slowly stealin' your kiss like this
Makin' your world stand still
Somebody else will baby
Ohh somebody else will
Yeah somebody else will
Somebody else will


You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all wanna change the world
But when you talk about the structure
Dont you know that you can count me out


Dont you know its gonna be
Alright alright
Dont you know its gonna be
Alright


You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We dont wanna see the plan
You ask me for a contradution
Well you know
We're all doin what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that way
All i can tell you is that you'll have to wait




You say you changed the constitution
Well you know
We all wanna change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carryin pictures of gemini
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow




Alright alright alright alright alright alright alright


My daddy spent his life looking up at the sky
He'd cuss kick the dust, saying son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing


Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing


Aren’t nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringing out our soaking clothes, riding out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talking, that's the best love we made
Yea where I come from, rain is a good thing


Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing


Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playing' in a big mud puddle


Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing


Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing

It's not the flowers
Wrapped in fancy paper
It's not the ring
I wear around my finger
There's nothing in all the world I need
When I have you here beside me
Here beside me

Chorus:
So you could give me wings to fly
And catch me if I fall
Or pull the stars down from the sky
So I could wish on them all
But I couldn't ask for more
'Cause your love is the greatest gift of all
In your arms
I found a strength inside of me
And in your eyes
There's a light to guide me
I would be lost without you
And all that my heart could ever want
Has come true

(chorus)

Bridge:
You could offer me the sun, the moon
And I would still believe
You gave me everything
When you gave your heart to me
(piano solo)
I couldn't ask for more
'Cause your love is the greatest gift of all

(chorus)


Hey, you and me baby
We’re flying on a wing and a prayer
Can’t tell you where we’re going
I just know that we’re gonna get there
Got all that we need in a cart in a checkout line
Hey, I’ll bag while you scan
I bet we beat traffic in time
Top down, now you’re singin’
It’s such a beautiful day
I don’t care what you’re thinking
Baby, put your map away


‘Cause we can go
Anywhere
Yeah we can go
Anywhere, I don’t care
California, Mississippi, all the way to New York City
As long as you’re riding shotgun with me
Anywhere
Love will get us there


Tell your boss maybe you’ll come back and maybe you won’t
Well in life sometimes people take chances
Most times they don’t
Don’t wanna sit on the side of the road
While our dreams pass me by
I’m sick of livin’ my life in park
I wanna live it in drive


‘Cause we can go
Anywhere
Yeah we can go
Anywhere, I don’t care
California, Mississippi, all the way to New York City
As long as you’re riding shotgun with me
Anywhere
Love will get us there


Anywhere
Yeah we can go
Anywhere, I don’t care
California, Mississippi, all the way to New York City
As long as you’re riding shotgun with me
Anywhere
Yeah we can go
Anywhere
Oh we can go
Anywhere
Love will get us there


I got a little drunk last night
There's something 'bout a midnight rain
Staring at the ceiling fan
I couldn't get you off my brain
I guess I wasn't thinking straight
I couldn't tell wrong from right
I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night


Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth, to both of us now
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why


Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night


I got a little too far gone
Heart was talking way too loud
I don't remember what I said
I just remember breaking down


Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth, to both of us now
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why


Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night

Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night


Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth, to both of us now
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why


I got a little drunk last night
I got a little drunk last night
Thought I could keep it all inside
But I got a little drunk last night


Duffle bag, backseat
My dash, your feet
Those other side of the highway headlights making you shine
My hand, your leg
Playlist playing
Even though I haven't made it yet
I'm dragging it, dropping it in my mind


You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl


You're the kind I wanna take a ride with
Sit by on a Friday night
In the stadium lights, side by side
All the ladies like, "Yeah, she's doing just fine"
Everybody in the bleachers, they all gon' want to meet ya
From my teachers to my preacher
My little crowd pleaser
Parading with you feeling homecoming cool, yeah


I wanna drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl


You're a take back, you're a take back
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home
You're a take back home girl


You got that down-home, homegrown, found on good ground soul
That down-home, homegrown, found on good ground soul


You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl


You're a take back, you're a take back
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home, yeah
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home

A yellow two piece, black Ray Bans
Your bare feet covered in sand
White jet trails across the blue sky
Your ponytail showing off the sunshine
Like a postcard, out of nowhere
You get to me, you give me that smile and


I'm somewhere, somewhere sunny and 75
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it, I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 75

It doesn't take much for you to move me
Just the way you're leaning into me
It's a holiday when we're together
I wanna stay with you forever


Somewhere, somewhere sunny and 75
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it, I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 75

You're like the fast lane West bound
You feel like a windows rolled down
I can't wait until we get there, somewhere

[Chorus}
Somewhere sunny and 75
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it, I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 75


I know forever is a long long time
For a girl to put her heart on the line
Trust is a tight rope we all have to walk
Baby don't be afraid I won't let you fall
With a little faith mountains move
You and me we can't lose


You can count on the sun to rise
And stars to come out at night
As long as there's air to breathe
You'll always be loved by me


Love comes so many times goes
So much out there we'll never know
Call it fate call it destiny
But I think we were meant to be
This old world it spins so fast
So many times they just don't last




You'll always be loved by me

I thought things couldn't get much worse
But guess what they did
You hit my heart upside with a wrecking ball
Oh but that's what I get
But I'm not going nowhere
I can live on my prayers
'Cause I'm done playin' nice
I'm done running for life
'Cause you think that you got me scared

This time it's goodbye trouble
I feel the light at the end of this tunnel
I get stronger with every step

Come Hell, come high water
You push on me I'm going to push back harder
I got a whole lot more than a little bit left
Oh, so don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Oh, don't put dirt on my grave just yet

Everyone can save their breath
They can spare me the change
You can point your finger somewhere else
If you're looking to blame

I'll give you something to believe
Nothing on me says defeat
No I'll never look back
So you better think fast
If you think you can cut me deep

This time it's goodbye trouble
I feel the light at the end of this tunnel
I get stronger with every step

Come Hell, come high water
You push on me I'm going to push back harder
I got a whole lot more than a little bit left
Hey, so don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Oh, don't put dirt on my grave just yet

Hey!
Well it's going to take more, going to take more, going to take more, to pull me under
Going to take more, going to take more, going to take more than that to pull me under!

This time it's goodbye trouble
I feel the light at the end of this tunnel
I get stronger with every step

Come Hell, come high water
You push on me I'm going to push back harder
I got a whole lot more than a little bit left
Oh, so don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Oh, don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Don't put dirt on my grave just yet

Heaven, heartache and the power of love

They say up in Heaven the streets are gold
Once you get past the Pearly Gates
And the angels are singin'
At the top of a dove white staircase

And I say heartache can burn you down like hell
Leave you beggin', "Baby, please don't go"
'Til you're scrapin' rock bottom
And cryin' in a deep dark hole

Oh, and love can make you fly like a rocket
Put you on top of the world

I'm talkin' 'bout
Heaven is where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache, that's where I've been
Heaven, heartache and the power of love

Well, the preacher says when your time is up
You take a chariot to the Lord
Well, I'm hopin' my chariot's
A torch red Thunderbird Ford

And my old flame said
"I hate to break it to you, darlin'
I was born the leavin' kind"
Left me standin' in the dark
Cryin', "Why baby, why baby, why?"

Oh, but real love's got me back in the saddle
Shoutin' amen again

That's what I know about
Heaven is where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache, that's where I've been
Heaven, heartache and the power of love

I gotta keep lovin' and livin'
And learnin' and burnin'
Movin' on down the road

Heaven is where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache, that's where I've been
Heaven, heartache and the power of

Heaven, it's where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache, that's where I've been
Heaven, heartache and the power of love
Heaven, heartache and the power of love

Heaven, where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache, that's where I've been
Heaven, heartache

Heaven, that's where I'm goin'
Heartache, oh, that's where I've been
Heaven, that's where I hope I'm goin'

If I'd a-known the way that this would end
If I'd a-read the last page first
If I'd a-had the strength to walk away
If I'd a-known how this would hurt

I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I'd a-loved you anyway

It's bittersweet to look back now
At mem'ries withered on the vine
But just to hold you close to me
For a moment in time

I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I'd a-loved you anyway

And even if I'd seen it coming
You'd still've seen me running
Straight into your arms

I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I would've loved you anyway

I would've loved you anyway

I know if I just keep my distance
You will see what you are missing
And you will learn that no one can love you like I do
I look involved in conversation
But I'm strugglin' with temptation
So tonight as you walk into the room

What I want is to hold you
Cause my world without you
Is just another lonely place to be
But what I need is to hold out
Until you have no doubt
There's only one love for you and it's me
So I'll be strong 'til you can believe what I need

My impression of what love is
Comes and goes like your kisses
It's clear as day when I hold you in my arms
Though I'll admit that you're my weakness
I'm gonna fight these feelings
Until you can promise me your heart

What I need is to hold out
Until you have no doubt
There's only one love for you and it's me
So I'll be strong 'til you can believe what I need
What I need

Hey babe won't you tell me what you've got going on
Just a little later on tonight
How about you and me get together have a couple drinks
Well don't you think that sounds like, a good time

You start striding over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha doing a little later

Let's go start a fire
How about you and i get this thing moving shaking grooving
Baby tell me what your doing
Later on later on later on later on later on later on

Girl your shining like a movie star
And y'know you look so good
I can't stop staring
And I can tell that your feelin' it too
What you wanna do with that smile your wearing
Oh yeah

What you say we got lost lets go
Spend a couple hours just getting to know each other
Out there in the moonlight glow
And when we get alone

You start striding over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha doing a little later

Let's go start a fire
How about you and i get this thing moving shaking grooving
Baby tell me what your doing
Later on later on later on later on later on later on

You start striding over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha doing a little later

Let's go start a fire
How about you and I get this thing moving shaking grooving
Baby tell me what your doing
Later on later on later on later on later on later on

I don't love him anymore
Just ask all my friends
I've told 'em and I tell 'em time and time again
I don't have no regrets
No, I'm not that kind
Honestly, he's the last thing on my mind

When the day turns into dusk
The shadows start to fall
And this empty bed's as big as Arkansas
When I'm drifting off to sleep
Something in my broken heart rewinds
He's the last thing
He's the last thing on my mind

Now, rushing through the day
I might seem improved
There isn't time to second-guess my foolish moves
No, I can only see
Once the lights go out
What it is that I can live with and without

When the day turns into dusk
The shadows start to fall
And this empty bed's as big as Arkansas
When I'm drifting off to sleep
Something in my broken heart rewinds
He's the last thing
He's the last thing on my mind

When the day turns into dusk
The shadows start to fall
And this empty bed's as big as Arkansas
When I'm drifting off to sleep
Something in my broken heart rewinds
He's the last thing
He's the last thing on my mind


Would've thought you wrote down every word
Goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
There ain't no point in trying to change your mind


Seems like
You've got it all figured out
You're alright
With the way this is going down


Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you


By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar


And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are?


Trying to tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you


You always told me
You'd never leave me
You said I was your one and only
So what makes you think I wanna hear you say
We can still be friends
No, I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah


That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you

Look at her go, walkin' away
Smile on her face, it?s so good to see her
With her feet off the ground, head in the clouds
Look at her now, crazy, crazy in love

She's gone right off the deep end
Long gone, her heart is beatin? stronger
She's finally found the one
And she knows when they're together
She's closer to forever
Than she's ever been before

And there's no way to stop that train she's on
She's gone

Check out her eyes, look at her grin
That must be him
I wonder if he knows how lucky he is
To be where he is, about to be kissed
There she goes and once she goes

She's gone right off the deep end
Long gone, her heart is beatin? stronger
She's finally found the one
And she knows when they're together
She's closer to forever
Than she's ever been before

And there's no way to stop that train she's on
She's gone, oh, she's gone

There's no way to stop that train she's on

She's gone right off the deep end
Long gone, her heart is beatin? stronger, she is stronger
She knows when they're together
She's close, closer to forever

Look at her go, walkin' away
There's no way to stop that train, she's gone
It's so good to see a smile on her face
There's no way to stop that train, she's gone
(She?s gone)

Long gone, stronger
There's no way to stop that train, she's gone
Hey baby baby
There's no way to stop that train


Lying here with you
Listening to the rain
Smiling just to see
The smile upon your face


These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments I'll remember all my life
I've found all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more


Looking in your eyes
Seeing all I need
Everything you are
Is everything in me


These are the moments I know heaven must exist
These are the moments I know all I need is this
I've found all I've waited for, yeah
And I could not ask for more


I could not ask for more than this time together
I could not ask for more than this time with you
And every prayer has been answered
Every dream I've had's come true
Yeah, right here in this moment
Is right where I'm meant to be
Here with you, here with me


These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments I'll remember all my life
I've found all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more


I could not ask for more than this time together
I could not ask for more than this time with you
And every prayer has been answered
Every dream I've had's come true
Yeah, right here in this moment
Is right where I'm meant to be
Here with you, here with me


No, I could not ask for more than this love you gave me
Cause it's all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more
No, yeah
No, I could not ask for more


If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who ruins your lipstick, not your mascara


You got a brand new, beat up broken heart
Black tears rollin' down your face
It's all crashin' down, you can't love again
'Cause nobody can take his place
Well I've been there, we've all been there
And I know how bad it feels
Well it's a big ol' world and I can promise you, girl
It's so good when its real


If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who would keep those pretty blue eyes as dry as the Sahara
If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who ruins your lipstick, not your mascara


The perfect kiss can make a mess
Of the brightest shade of red
Yeah you won't mind a little reapplying
Time and time again
And you'll forget you ever felt like this
When he falls right out of the blue
Oh yeah I swear he's out there somewhere
Looking for you too


If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who would keep those pretty blue eyes as dry as the Sahara
If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who ruins your lipstick, not your mascara

Ohhh
Ohhh


If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who would keep those pretty blue eyes as dry as the Sahara
If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who ruins your lipstick, not your mascara


Ohhh
Oooh if you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who ruins your lipstick, not your mascara

Well it's a Kung Pao Buckaroo holiday
Whatever you do watch what you say
If you're easily offended well that's ok
It's a completely non-offensive
And politically correct holiday


Guess it’s written on my face
God, I get so sick of this place
I gotta get up, get out
And get a life

The days run long
The nights too short
Not much time for me no more
And I'm well over due
So now I'm going to


Let my hair down
And bleach it blonde
Turn the ringer off
And the engine on
'Cause I can't wait to get to the good times

Yeah, just one stop at the ATM
Grab a hundred bucks
And a real good friend
Pack it up
And take a load off my mind
'Cause I can't wait to get to the good times


Me and my baby get along
Got a lot of love
Got it goin' on
I wouldn't let go no for anything

Somethin' bout how the highway feels
When you drive along on your freedom wheels
You know any destination
Will kill the frustration




Just for the weekend
Let's jump off the deep end
I'm goin' to



I met a guy last night and girl I felt the earth move
If you'd a been there I swear you would've felt it to
But I spilled red wine on his white shirt
I stuttered and stumbled over all my words

Cause he's got these brown eyes that drive me crazy
And oh my god that smile of his just slays me
Yeah I love him, wanna have his babies
The only problem is he hates me

I thought I'd make things better so I asked if he'd like to dance
If we could get a little closer I thought we might have a chance
Then my ex walked in and a fight broke out
So much for a kiss with his busted up mouth

But he's got these brown eyes that drive me crazy
And oh my god that smile of his just slays me
Yeah I love him, wanna have his babies
The only problem is he hates me

We could be honeymoonin' south of the border
If he'd just drop that restraining order

Cause he's got these brown eyes that drive me crazy
And oh my god that smile of his just slays me
Yeah I love him, wanna have his babies
The only problem is he hates me

Yeah, whatever hunny

Right time, the right place
The right body, the right face
Timber I'm falling in love
It started slow, it's coming fast
I got a feelin it's gonna last
Timber I'm falling in love
You're so pretty, look so sweet
Your love's sweepin me off of my feet
You're the only one I'm dreamin of
I can't believe that I'm falling in love
Who knows how love starts
I woke up with you in my heart
Timber I'm falling in love
You're so pretty, look so sweet
Your love's sweepin me off of my feet
You're the only one I'm dreamin of
I can't believe that I'm falling in love
Timber I'm falling in love
Timber I'm falling in love
Timber I'm falling in love


Last night downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out of style
My whole head got light
I lost my eyesight
I haven't been that drunk in a while
Along about 1 I spotted a queen
And I started to make my move
Aw, she was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well I thought I died and gone to heaven
But lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2


Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But lord when I do I lose
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2


Well I made up my mind
I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same bar stool
And just look at the shape I'm in
I done spotted me another queen
Sitting at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes, I thought I'd been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2


Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But lord when I do I lose
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2


Now you may laugh
But if you've got the cash
I'll bet you 10 to 1 you have too


It's perfect outside, it's like God let me dial up the weather
Got the whole crew here, I ain't seen some of them in forever
It's one of those 'never forget it; better stop and take it in' kind of scenes
Everything's just right, yeah, except for one thing


You should be here
Standing with your arm around me here
Cuttin' up crackin' a cold beer
Sayin' cheers
Hey y'all, it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here
(You should be here)


You'd be takin' way too many pictures on your phone
Showin' 'em off to everybody that you know back home
And even some you don't, yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face


You should be here
Standin' with your arm around me here
Cuttin' up crackin' a cold beer
Sayin' cheers
Hey y'all, it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
Aw, you should be here


You'd be lovin' this
You'd be freakin' out
You'd be smilin'
Yeah, I know you'd be all about
What's goin' on right here, right now
God, I wish somehow
You could be here
Aw, you should be here


Yeah, this is one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
Aw, you should be here
(You should be here)
(You should be here)
You should be here

Verse 1:
I give him love the best I can
But you don't seem to understand
It's not always deep but it's always true
And he does not belong to you
Hey

Bridge:
I do not forgive and I do not forget
I will fight for love
Until the death

Chorus:
Jezebel save your charms
He'll be back here in my arms
Oh, how quickly you forget
He's not yours yet
He is not yours, not yet

Verse 2:
Gonna throw on this cotton dress
Put lilac scent on the back of my neck
I walk barefoot down that mountainside
Straight to your door
Girl, you can't hide
'Cause

Bridge

Chorus

Standing out in the pouring rain
Calling out my lover's name
I know he won't leave me in the cold
Send my baby home
Send my baby home

Jezebel save your charms
He'll be back here in my arms
Oh, how quickly you forget
He's not yours yet (not yours yet)
He's not yours yet (not yours yet)
Oh, he is not yours
Never!


I guess you could say I'm one of those girls
Who's always been with one of those guys
You know the type
Like right now, he sleeps while I write
But it's better than crying
Warn out from trying
From loving a man who always makes it clear
I am not welcome here
Just till he's horney or hungry or needs something clean
You know what I mean
But not tonight
Cause come the morning light, oh


I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
Believe in me
Even if someone can't see
A stronger woman in me
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again
Never, no
Cause there's a stronger woman
A stronger woman in me


Light bulbs buzz, I get up
Head to my drawer
Wish there was more
I could say
Another fairy tale fades to grey
I've lived on hope
Like a child
Walking that mile
Faking that smile
All the while
Wishing my heart had wings
Well from now on I'm gonna be
The kind of woman I'd want my daughter to be, oh


I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
Believe in me
Even if someone can't see
A stronger woman in me
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again
Never, no
Cause there's a stronger woman
A stronger woman


This is me packing up my bags
This is me headed for the door
This is me, the best you ever had


I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
Believe in me, even if someone can't see
The a stronger woman in me
Gonna be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again, no, no
Cause there's a stronger woman, stronger woman
There's a stronger woman, stronger woman in me
Stronger woman in me


I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today


I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names


I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world


And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today


State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way


I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn


There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be


I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn


And if you're missing me
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health


Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn


Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn


I'm getting older
Finding myself and God getting a little bit closer
And Sober
I'm a little less reckless, little less wild card
Breaking hearts kinda senseless
Yeah, I'm coming around


I might cuss and fight, tell a few lies
Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep
But I've turned the page on wilder days
I'm writing all this down hoping you'll see
I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me


I say I'm sorry
Sometimes it's the hardest part to tell somebody
But baby I'm sorry
Yeah I've been praying
Coming from me that might sound a little bit crazy
But I swear I'm changing


I might cuss and fight, tell a few lies
Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep
But I've turned the page on wilder days
I'm running all this down hoping you'll see
I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me yeah


Didn't wanna call you up
Didn't wanna just stop
Wanted to take my time and make sure I got every word right


Yeah, I still cuss and fight
Tell you lies
Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep
But I've turned the page on wilder days
I'm running all this down hoping you'll see
I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me
I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me

On a better me
Better me


Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky look down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay


The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes
The little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes
I love the Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is night


Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky look down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay


Away in a manger
Away in a manger

There are some roads you must walk yourself
Just you and your own Faith: nothing else
And on those dark days you're bound to go through
Here's something to hold on to

You got one believer
One whose Faith goes deeper
When someone loves you as much as me
One believer is all you need

This world's gonna try to bring you down
But don't you let it: you just stand your ground
Whatever happens, never forget:
Wherever you are, as long as I live

You got one believer
One whose Faith goes deeper
When someone loves you as much as me
One believer is all you need

When someone loves you as much as me
One believer is all you need

One (One.)
Believer
One whose Faith goes deeper
When someone loves you as much as me
One believer is all you need

Oh One (Just one.)
Believer
Mmm

For all the times I felt cheated, I complained
You know how I love to complain
For all the wrongs I repeated, though I was to blame
I still cursed that rain
I didn't have a prayer, didn't have a clue
Then out of the blue

GOD gave me you to show me what's real
There's more to life than just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why
Now I do, cause GOD  gave me you

For all the times I wore my self pity like a favorite shirt
All wrapped up in that hurt
For every glass I saw, I saw half empty
Now it over flows like a river through my soul
From every doubt I had, I'm finally free
And I truly believe

GOD gave me you to show me what's real
There's more to life than just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why
Now I do, cause GOD gave me you

In your arms I'm someone new
With every tender kiss from you
I must confess, I've been blessed

GOD gave me you to show me what's real
There's more to life than just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why
Now I do, cause GOD gave me you
GOD gave me you


Get ready for the big revival
Get ready for the big revival


Get ready for the big revival
C'mon everybody get in the van
There's a little church on Eagle Mountain
It's called The Blood of the Blessed Lamb


If your faith ain't strong enough child, you might wind up dead
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead


Reverend Jones, he struts and dances
While the guitar plays Amazing Grace
He testifies in tongues of fire
With tears of joy runnin' down his face


He ain't sure and we ain't sure what exactly he said
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead


You won't find many hypocrites
That'll take a chance on gettin' bit
But a true believer can survive
Rattlesnakes and cyanide


When you hold that deadly viper
Keep the Holy Spirit in your mind
Do not lose your concentration
Or that serpent's bound to strike


Either way you won't forget the first time that you said
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead


Oh that's right
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead


Yeah girl, been diggin' on you
Sippin' on drink number two
Tryin' to come up with somethin' smooth
And waitin' on the right time to make my move
But I just can't wait no more
Can't let you slip out that door
You're the prettiest thing I ever seen before
Got me spinnin' around, I ain't even on the dance floor


You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Yeah gotta get me some of that


Little more what you doin' right there
Swingin' your hips and slingin' your hair
Side to side with your drink in the air
Lord have mercy now girl I swear
Gotta get your number in my phone
Gotta get me some of you alone
We can worry 'bout it later on
Right now keep makin' this my favorite song


You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Yeah gotta get me some of that


In my ride, by my side, down the highway
In the dark, in my arms, in your driveway
All because of that smile you threw my way
Yeah girl you got a way of


You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Yeah gotta get me some of that


Yeah, I gotta get me some of that
Oh girl, I gotta get me some of that
Oh yeah
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor
I want it now and later

Leavin's hard... trust me, it's really bad
It'll shake ya, damn near break ya, it always has
You don't go until you're prayin' to break even
Until stayin's worse than leavin'

God knows we tried everything that we could do
You can keep your pride and blame me if you need to
Even though this freedom feels a lot like treason
I know stayin's worse than leavin'

It's gotta get better, it can't get worse
Hope it's a blessing not a curse
I don't care who passes judgement on my reasons
I know stayin's worse than leavin'

It's gotta get better, it can't get worse
Hope it's a blessing not a curse
I don't care who passes judgement on my reasons
I know stayin's worse than leavin'

Both our hearts let go a long time ago
Words leave scars and Lord knows they heal slow
Our love died, but somehow we are both still breathin'
I just hope someday we'll look back on this grievin'
And say stayin's worse than leavin'
Yeah, that stayin's worse than leavin'
Yeah, that stayin's worse than leavin'

She was pretty
She was smart
She was witty
Yeah, she had charm
Cupid shot me
That's what got me down the aisle
But that match made in heaven
Went straight to hell
Split up our possessions
Put the house up for sale
And I learned a lesson I won't be forgetting
The next time around

I'm going to marry for money
I'll be so damn rich it ain't funny
I'm going to have me a trust fund, yacht club, hot tub
Piece of the pie
Find me a sweet sugar mama
With a whole lot of zeros and commas
Don't really care if she loves me
She can even be ugly
I'm going to marry for money

I won't have to love her family
I won't have to like her friends
And if it works out like I planned it
I won't ever have to work again

I'm going to marry for money
I'll be so damn rich it ain't funny
I'm going to have me a trust fund, yacht club, hot tub
Piece of the pie
Find me a sweet sugar mama
With a whole lot of zeros and commas
Don't really care if she loves me
She can even be ugly
I'm going to marry for money

Show me the money
Cha-ching
You all, I'm going to find a wife
On a leer jet the old lady buys me
I'll call her sweet heart and honey
If she's a hundred and twenty
I don't care if she loves me
She can be really ugly
I'm going to marry for money
Oh, cha-ching
Mucho dinero

Come over here you good looking thing you
There's your walker in the corner
Over, over

She was standin' there at the edge of outta control
Hair wild and her eyes filled with the pain
She took her heart on a string and tied it to a red balloon
And she watched it fly up high into the clouds

Don't break my heart again, we're one in the same
Baptized by tears, washed in the blame
You can let your heart go, but I will hunt you down
Your love is all I want to win, don't break my heart again

He dreams of a girl with a heart tied to a red balloon
He wants her so bad, she wants him too
There standin' there at the edge of another lonely night
House empty and the walls are cavin' in

Don't break my heart again, we're one in the same
Baptized by tears, washed in the blame
You can let your heart go, but I will hunt you down
Your love is all I want to win, don't break my heart again

It's hard to find love
It's hard to find love

Your love is all I want to win
Don't break my heart again


Lace-up boots and faded jeans
A homemade sandwich, a half jug of tea
Average Joe, average pay
Same ol' end and same ol' day


But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man


All week long making a living
Life keeps takin', he keeps giving
Behind the scene, below the grade
Hardly noticed but part of everything




He gives his life then fades away
Another young man takes his place
Average Joe, average pay
Same ol end, same old' day


But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
No, there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man


The working man
Oh, the working man and woman


She's caviar and mascara
I'm corduroy and leather
It'd take one hell of an imagination
To ever paint us together


Places I like to haunt at
She wouldn't be caught dead
Don't make sense to the neighbors, don't look good on paper
And sure don't make sense in my head


But I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, we'll roll


Can't say there won't be rough patches
Scratches from thorns and briars
Over or under, we'll roll like thunder
As long as there's tread on these tires


I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll


Ain't no map, ain't no way
Ain't no lights on this long highway
But I know the way by heart
Bring on the dark
Honey, don't worry


Baby, I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll
I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, we roll
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's go


Would you like to live in Houston, where the cowboys come to town
Or maybe Pensacola, where the sun shines all year 'round
Or even New York City, where the city never sleeps
I'm offering you the option before you get in too deep


If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here


There's work up in Seattle, if you don't mind the rain
San Diego to Savannah, they'd all be glad you came
But life with me would always be a roller coaster ride
You won't hurt my feelings, whatever you decide


If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here


This place might look real good right now, but looking good don't last
But if you choose it, anyhow, I'll give you all I have


If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here


Baby, you can stay right here (if you can do anything else, baby be good to yourself)
Oh, baby, you can stay right here (if you can do anything else, baby be good to yourself)
Baby, you can stay right here (if you can do anything else)


Kick it
I don't need a shrink to tell me what to think
There ain't no missing link in my love life
It's alright, I ain't that uptight
No, I don't need a psychic 'cause I don't really like it
When someone tries to tell me just what my future holds
I already know


Your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side


So I'm holdin' on, I'm feelin' strong
Baby, you're the one for all my life
Yeah, I'm holdin' out, there ain't no doubt
I can't live without you all my life!
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life


Oh, I don't need to get all caught up on the net 'cause I'm already set
Can't you understand I already got my man?
No, I don't need proof to show me the truth
Not even Dr. Ruth Is going to tell me how I feel
I know our love is real, real, real


Your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side


So I'm holdin' on, I'm feelin' strong
Baby, you're the one for all my life

I'm holdin' on to love (I'm holdin' on to love)
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life


Save me, save me, save me
Save my life

Some kids have and some don't
And some of us are wondering why
Mom won't watch the news at night
There's too much stuff that's making her cry

We need some help
Down here on earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard

A house
A yard
A neighborhood
Where you can ride your new bike to school
A kind of world where Mom and Dad
Still believe in the golden rule

Life's not that simple
Down here on earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard

One voice, one simple word
Hearts know what to say
One dream can change the world
Keep believing
Till you find a way

Yesterday, while walking home
I saw some kid on Newberry Road
He pulled a pistol from his bag
And tossed it in the river below

Thanks for the help
Down here on earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard
One voice was heard
One voice was heard


Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life makin' trouble
Half your life makin' it right
One day I'm the exception
Most days I'm just like most
Some days I'm headed in the right direction
And some days I ain't even close


I'm a little bit steady but still little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man


I always loved the highway
I just don't run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still don't get it right sometimes
I just don't get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long


I'm a little bit steady but still little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Still just a burning man


Maybe I'll go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Tree
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light
And tell me you burned just like me


I'm a little bit steady but still little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man


Just a burning man
Burning man, burning man

I've seen the storms comin' so many times I'm losin' track
Yesterdays clouds are rollin' in again
Oh, and what a woman, every time I start thinkin' back
How she's come and gone just like the wind

And there's no such thing as old forgotten memories
No such thing as the only one to blame
And I'm not one who'll never see the forest for the trees
But I can't find a rainbow in the rain

I wake up in the mornin'
Hope I got you outta my head
But not if I'm shiverin' from the cold
And the red skies warnin' to say I'd better stay in bed
And don't go lookin' for a pot of gold

'Cause there's no such thing as old forgotten memories
No such thing as the only one to blame
And I'm not one who'll never see the forest for the trees
But I can't find a rainbow in the rain

No, there's no such thing as old forgotten memories
And I don't go lookin' for rainbows in the rain


I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds
When an ad that said, "old Chevy" somehow caught my eye
The lady didn't know the year or even if it ran
But I had that thousand dollars in my hand


It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
With thirty years of dust and dirt on that green Army tarp
And when I pulled the cover off, it took away my breath
What she called a Chevy was a sixty-six Corvette


I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
What a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note
The date was nineteen sixty-six and this is what he wrote


He said, "My name is Private Andrew Malone
And if you're reading this, then I didn't make it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of mine, now it belongs to you
And though you may take her and make her your own
You'll always be riding with Private Malone"


Well, it didn't take me long at all, I had her running good
I loved to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood
I had her shining like a diamond and I'd put the ragtop down
All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town


The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right
But it picked up that oldie show, especially late at night
I'd get the feeling sometimes, if I turned real quick I'd see
A soldier ridin' shotgun in the seat right next to me


It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
He told me to take her and make her my own
And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone


Well, one night it was raining hard, I took the curve too fast
I still don't remember much about that fiery crash
Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
They didn't get his name, but I know without a doubt


It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
And I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along
Yeah, that night, I was riding with Private Malone
Oh, thank God, I was riding with Private Malone
Private Malone


If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall
If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces
Of a jagged heart
You kissed me and every piece went back in place
Every pain got erased
You held me up to the sunlight
Now it feels like


No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile fill my soul again
I am unbroken


If I doubted the power of love, baby now I understand
I thank God for every day I wake up to the soft touch
Of your magic hands
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real is the way you make me feel
Babe, the changes day and night
I swear it's life


No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile fill my soul again
I am unbroken


I still see the night, I fell into your eyes
And when we made love it felt like the first time


No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile fill my soul again
I am unbroken
I am unbroken
I am unbroken


No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken...


Normally this time of night, you wouldn't find me here
I'd be reaching for a good night kiss instead of one more beer
I'd never take a second look at the blond across the bar
Much less invite her over and let things go this far


But anything goes, when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone


Another morning after, a crazy night before
I'm searching for my blue jeans on the stranger's bedroom floor
Shouldn't I feel guilty? Well I don't feel a thing
I'd wake her up and say good bye but I can't recall her name
Anything goes, when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone
If you'd a left a single thread for me to hold on to
I'd have one good reason not to do the things I do


But anything goes, when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone


Shotgun shack on the edge of town
It's where I'll be when the sun goes down
Big money bird dog barkin' out back
Wouldn't trade him in for a Cadillac
County wanna pave my old dirt road
Went to the courthouse, said hell no


It's a country thang, it's a fish on a string
Mary Jane chompin' on a chicken wing
It's a tire swing on a riverbank
It's the way we talk, it's the way we sing
It's either in your blood or it ain't
It's a country thang


Known my girl since she was fourteen
She's the first runner up to the Hart County Cotton Queen
She was raised on cornbread, purple hull peas
She turns 'em heads at the feed 'n seed
She rides in the middle of my four-wheel drive
Got a honey hole way back in the pines


It's a country thang, it's some cut off jeans
Paintin' her toes on a porch swing
Sweet like sugar cane in a good rain
Make a little love while the tin roof sings
It's either in your blood or it ain't
It's a country thang


It's a country thang, barefoot and crazy
Fried green tomatoes and some sawmill gravy
Take pride in workin' hard for a livin'
Pray before meals, it feels good givin'
Back to the needy, greedy's not us
Thank God for it, even if it ain't much
That's how we does it down here in the mud
What else can I say, y'all, it's in my blood


It's either in your blood or it ain't
That's how we does it 'round here
It's either in your blood or it ain't
C'mon, y'all
It's a country thang
It's a country thang
It's a country thang
It's just a country thang


Worn and haggard, weathered and torn
Drug through the keyhole of that back door
Blood shot red behind these shades
I look like hell, yes, I've seen better days


And then those loving arms they pull me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again


I'm rust on a barbed wire, I'm dust on a chrome yeah
Yes I'm the heart that bleeds in an old country song


And then those loving arms they pull me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again


Leather and lace, denim and pearls
Whiskey and wine, they go just fine, like you and me, girl
When you smile at me and say, there ain't no better place
Than you'd rather be than right here loving me


Standing in that kitchen, it's been a long day at work
Then you slip those hands right under my shirt


Oh with those loving arms you pull me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again
There you go, baby, making me look good again

I said daddy
I knew I'd find you in this bar
And I know it's been hard me blamin' you
All these years for my tears

But daddy
I need to know what to do
Sometimes I feeling like running too
Is it worth the pain
Do you have regrets
That's when he turned and said

Go home
While there's still one to go to
Hold on
While there's someone to hold you
Don't walk
Run as fast as you can
Crawl if you have to
While there's still a chance
Cause leavin' don't get you nowhere
You're just gone
Go home

He said son
Just take a look around and see
Is this the way you want it to be
Night after night hiding from the truth
Son that's not you

I said mamma
Still talks about you all the time
And she would be so happy to find
You at her door yeah that's the day
We're both praying for

Go home
While there's still one to go to
Hold on
While there's someone to hold you
Don't walk
Run as fast as you can
Crawl if you have to
While there's still a chance
Cause leavin' don't get you nowhere
You're just gone
Go home

Go home
Go home


I turn the TV off to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound


I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over


You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else


I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over


We don’t have to miss each other, come over
We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over


I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over


Grab your keys, climb in your car
Put your headlights in my yard
Pull up the drive, put it in park
Walk inside, underneath my stars
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting
Don't say a word, don't say a word
Come over


Street lights along the highway
Throwin' shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turnin'
To the rhythm of a broken heart


You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

Parachute


There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say


You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

Parachute


If you think you're goin' down
Just know I will be around


You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute

Parachute


Somebody's gotta start the weekend
Somebody's got to unwind
Somebody's gotta find that honky-tonk
Out on the county line
With pretty things and a band that swings
That gets 'em all out on the floor
And if we're gonna get the party started
Somebody's gotta swing those doors


Somebody's gotta feed that jukebox
Somebody's gotta drink that beer
Somebody's gotta get all rowdy
And raise some hell in here
Somebody's gotta dance with the women
Spin 'em to a country song
I can do this night life all day long


Somebody's gonna need a shoulder
When that sad song plays
Somebody's gonna need to hold her
Tell her it's okay
Just let her know to let it go
And then she's gonna have some fun
If she needs some help gettin' over him
Somebody's gotta get it done


Somebody's gotta shoot that whiskey
Somebody gotta bust that rack
Somebody's gotta play that country that ain't ever comin' back
If home is where the heart is then I'm right where I belong
I can do this night life all day long


Somebody's gotta go the distance
Somebody's gotta call last round
Somebody's gotta turn the lights on
And shut this ol' bar down
When mornin' comes you'll find someone
With a headache and a grin
You know Saturday night is comin'
Somebody's gotta go again


Somebody's gotta feed that jukebox
Somebody's gotta hold my beer
Somebody's gotta get a little crazy
And raise some hell in here
Somebody's gotta spend that paycheck
'Til the money's gone
I can do this night life all day long
I can do this night (let me hear you say)
All day long
(Yeah!)


These fields don't grow overnight, this town wasn't built in a day
I'll be turnin' that dirt when the sun comes up
Goin' round in circles while that plane you're on takes you away
Chasin' down that sun in L.A, 2000 miles it ain't that far
Girl, wherever you are


I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
Find your way back, I'll pray you do
I'll wait for you
The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through, I'll wait for you


I'll keep the light on on the porch, I'll keep the key under the mat
Just in case I'm out there somewhere tryin' not to lose my mind
When you come back I know you gotta go
And if you don't girl you'll never know
And if you can't find what you want out there
I'll be right here, ain't goin' nowhere


I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
Find your way back, I'll pray you do
I'll wait for you
The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through, I'll wait for you
Oh I'll wait for you


These fields don't grow overnight
This town wasn't built in a day
Some things you love are worth the wait
Worth the wait


I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
Find your way back, I'll pray you do
I'll wait for you
The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through, I'll wait for you
Oh I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
Oh I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

On an icy road one night
A young man loses his life
They marked the shoulder with a cross
An' his family gathers round
On a piece of Hallowed ground
Their hearts are heavy with their loss
As the tears fall from their eyes
There's one who'll always sympathise

God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are left to carry on
An' all the angels up in Heaven
They're not grieving because they're gone
There's a smile on their faces
'Cause they're in a better place than, mmm, baby, than, oh
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are so far from home

It still makes me sad
When I think of my Grand-dad
I miss him each and every day
But I know the time will come
When my own gradnson
Wonders why I went away
Maybe we're not meant to understand
Till we meet up in the Promised Land

God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are left to carry on
And all the angels up in Heaven
They're not grieving because they're gone
There's a smile on their faces
'Cause they're in a better place than, oh, baby, than oh
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are so far from home
Yeah, we're so far from home, Mmmm, Mmmm


Let's go


We showed up here when the sun went down
Hit it hard, kicked it off right
You think by now we'd be heading out
Hanging it up and calling it a night


But we're just getting warmed up
Just getting started
Already fired up, yeah this party
Ain't nothing like it round here
Going down out here
Another double shot of crazy in cup
We're just getting warmed up
Yeah we're just getting warmed up

Just party crowds waiting all week
And when we got in and rolling out
It's going fast and picking up steam


But we're just getting warmed up

Already fired up, yeah this party
Ain't nothing like it round here
Going down out here

Yeah we're just getting warmed up


Captured my attention, make my heart stop and listen
When you look my way
Blue jeans and a ball cap, thinking that you're all that
And I'm thinking the same
You got that something in your eyes, I think about it all the time
If you ever wonder if I wanna make you mine


Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy


Every song that's playing gets me thinking about you, baby
And the way you roll
So let's put down the drop top, burn a little blacktop
Off of that road
Baby, what we waiting on?
The stars are out, the night is young
If you wanna know if I wanna go and get gone


Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy


Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh

But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight

Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight, yeah

Well the weekends finally here
St. Croix River, here I come
Time for me to disappear
Head into that sky-blue-water sun
Im going up north
Ten thousand lakes say jump in
Those blue-eyed girls know something
So you better be listening
Get on board
Gather up all of your friends
This is where the blacktop ends
This is where the fun begins
You are entering
This is where the old man Mississippi
Starts to rip and make his run
And when you see those northern lights, hold on tight
Because the ride has just begun
Were going up north
Ten thousand lakes say jump in
Those blue-eyed girls know something
So you better start listening
So get on board
Gather up all of your friends
This is where the fun begins
You are entering
Up here we need to learn to sing
A song for every season
Winter has a reason
Otherwise thered be no spring
When summer comes we soak it in
And play our way through autumn
Raise your glasses if you got em
And lets toast the whole damn thing
Put the city in the rear view
Forget your 9-to-5
Youre about to see North Country come alive
Up here we need to learn to sing
A song for every season
Winter has a reason
Otherwise there'd be no spring
When summer comes
We get wild and free
There ain't a better place to be
So raise your hands and sing with me
We're all going up to the North Country

When you're young, you think you know it all
Yeah, you're hot-rod cocky
An' you stand there like a man an' say:
"There ain't nothin' strong enough to stop me"
Until some beautiful girl, bare-legged an' sandalled
Loosens her grip on everything you had handled

You don't know how to drive till you get behind the wheel;
And you don't know how to play until you fin'lly take the field
Well, you don't know how it'll go
Where it'll land until you cut the deal
You don't know what really matters until you risk it all
Ain't nothin' that's worth winnin' if losin's not involved
And if you're afraid to give away your heart and face what love brings
Man, you don't know a thing

You got your life all planned out:
Sure looks good on paper
Until your American dream smacks up against
The rising cost of Labour
'Cause as you dob every job in your hometown
An' you learn how to survive when it all goes south

Well, you don't know how to drive till you get behind the wheel;
An' you don't know how to play until you fin'lly take the field
Well, you don't know how it'll go
Where it'll land until you cut the deal
An' you don't know what really matters until you risk it all
Ain't nothin' that's worth winnin' if losin's not involved
And if you're afraid to give away your heart and face what life brings
Man, you don't know a thing

When your knees all night
With a child with a ragin' fever
An' you realise this might be
The last time you see her
Life holds on, an' Faith holds on
An' love holds that little tiny hand

Well, you don't know how to drive till you get behind the wheel
An' you don't know how to pray until you're scared of what you feel
And if you're afraid to give away your heart and face what life brings
Man, you don't know a thing
You don't know a thing
Hey, you don't know a thing

(Kellie Coffey/Brett James)

Throw the covers off my head
Shake my body out of bed
Stretch my arms up
And look out the window
Sun is rising
Birds are singing
I am greeted by the gift of another new morning
And I know tonight as my head hits the pillow
I will ask myself as I look out the same window
At the end of the day
Did I laugh and dance enough
Did I tell my friends how much they really mean to me
At the end of the day
Did I really push myself
Or was I too afraid
To give my heart away
At the end of the day
I wanna learn I wanna live
Take some big chance and just trust in my instincts and my intuition
If I win or if I lose
Any road that I choose
I will drive all the way

I wanna know tonight as I fall fast asleep
I am one day closer
To where I wanna be
At the end of the day
Did I laugh and dance enough
Did I tell my friends how much they really mean to me
At the end of the day
Did I really push myself
Or was I too afraid
To give my heart away
At the end of the day
To never forget what matters most
To never have to answer noooooo
When I ask myself
Did I laugh and dance enough
Did I tell my friends how much they really mean to me
At the end of the day
At the end of the day
Did I really push myself
Or was I too afraid
At the end of the day

She's her momma's baby she's her daddy's pride an' joy
They've kept her under wraps she ain't been hangin' out
With any ugly I can boy, hardly ever been kissed

Twenty years of innocence, just what I'm lookin' for
I wanna be the man that's holdin' her hand
When she can't hold it back any more

Good little girls make some mighty wild women
Been savin' it up since the very beginnin'
When they fall in love they wanna take it to the limit
Good little girls make some mighty wild women

Well she's never been to Vegas or danced in a Honky Tonk
No trail of broken hearts although she looks the part
That ain't the kind of life she wants, she's waitin' for a gold ring

Before she tries her wings, that's what I'm waitin' for
I wanna be the man that's holdin' her hand
When she can't hold it back any more

Good little girls make some mighty wild women
Been savin' it up since the very beginnin'
When they fall in love they wanna take it to the limit
Good little girls make some mighty wild women


Girl I know I don’t know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town


Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good


You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot


And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end


Going to cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know that the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you’ll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss


Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive


You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot


And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end




You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot


And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end
I don’t want this night to end
No I don’t want this night to end


I'm meetin' my buddies out on the lake
We're headed out to a special place we love
That just a few folks know
There's no signin' up, no monthly dues
Take your Johnson, your Mercury
Or your Evinrude an' fire it up
Meet us out at party cove
Come on in the water's fine
Just idle on over an' toss us a line


Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club


Bermuda's, flip-flops and a tank-top tan
He popped his first top at 10 a.m., that's Bob
He's our president
We're checkin' out the girls on the upper deck
Rubbin' in the 15 SPF, it's hot
Everybody's jumpin' in
Later on when the sun goes down
We'll pull out the jar and that old guitar
An' pass 'em around


Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club


When the party's over and we're all alone
We'll be makin' waves in a no-wake zone


Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club

Redneck Yacht Club
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na
The Redneck Yacht Club
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na


Well it was friday in the p.m
And just like every weekend
I was ready to throw down
Yeah get a little tore up
So I call my bros up to meet me out on the town
Well wild man willy said I like to really
But idol's on tv
And ray had a date
With his wife and Nate quit drinking
But he didn't tell me


Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?


Well I was flying solo down at Silverado's
The joint looking like a morgue
When this country cutie with a rock and roll booty
Came strutting in through the door
Yelled who wants to dance and fired up the band with with a franklin and a shot of patron
She looked right at me and said
"What's it gonna be
Are you gonna let me to party alone?"


Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?


Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?


Come on come on
Get your good time on
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight


They like to kick you when you're down
They like it better when you're there on the ground
And up 'til now I've never made a sound
Hey, hey
I bet they've never had a broken heart
But they sure know how to beat the hell out of one
Sometimes I think they do it just for the fun
Hey, hey


But no, I'm not leaving, even though I'm bleeding
Even though this nightmare makes me wish I was dreaming
Even though I hate it, I'm gonna take it
Until I win


Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Don't know why bad things happened, but they did
I don't think I deserve the hurt I get, but I'm made for it
It's not the end, no, it's not the end
I'm a comeback kid
Down for a minute; I'll get up again
Looks like I'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet
Cause in the end
I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid


I'm gonna finish what I started now
You interrupted me with all your doubts
How dare you forget where I started out
Uh-oh, uh-oh


But no, I'm not leaving, even though I'm bleeding
Even though this nightmare makes me wish I was dreaming
Even though I hate it, I'm gonna take it
Until I win


Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Don't know why bad things happened, but they did
I don't think I deserve the hurt I get, but I'm made for it
It's not the end, no, it's not the end
I'm a comeback kid
Down for a minute; I'll get up again
Looks like I'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet
Cause in the end
I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid, uh-huh


I believe in what I am; I believe in what I was
I believe in losing you, I've never been given so much
I believe it's been a year, the worst one I've ever lived
I believe I'm better now than I have ever been
I believe that ever since everything went south
I believed in every word that ever came out of my mouth
I believe you missed me, but you don't have to miss me, cause
I'm not leaving again


Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Down for a minute; I'll get up again
Looks like I'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet
Cause in the end
Yeah, I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Not leaving again, I'm not leaving
Not leaving again, I'm not leaving
Not leaving again, I'm not leaving


I'll save you a spot at my big parade
You're all invited on my comeback day
I'll serve you ice cream and lemonade
Hey, hey

The things you say
They hit me with a right sometimes
They hit me with a left sometimes
But I'm still standing
For us
You make me wanna dream sometimes
Make me wanna scream sometimes
I'd never give you up

So no! You are not alone
I am in this too
This is us
This is me and you
So go, turn and walk out that door
Hope you find what you're lookin' for
Just know only God could love you more
Than I do

I know
We take it to the limit sometimes
Our friends get caught up in it sometimes
But can you tell me
Who goes
From good as it gets sometimes
To wish we never met sometimes
I'm not understanding

No you are not alone
I am in this too
This is us
This is me and you
So go, turn and walk out that door
Hope you find what you're lookin' for
Just know only God could love you more
Than I do

The things you say
They hit me with a right sometimes
They hit me with a left sometimes
I'm still standing
We're still standing

So no! You are not alone
I am in this too
This is us
This is me and you
So go, turn and walk out that door
Hope you find what you're lookin' for
Know only God could love you more
Than I do


I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road
And it's not like her to drive that slow, nothin's on the radio
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell
She usually comes right in, now I can tell


Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye


I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
And violins would play here comes the bride


Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye


Why does it have to go from good to gone?
Before the lights turn on, yeah and youre left alone
All alone, but here comes goodbye


Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

Baby won't you take my hand
I will take good care of you
It's time for me to take a stand
I know I've got a lot to prove

Cause oh baby when the last man committed
He broke your heart
Betrayed your trust
When the last man committed
He told you lies with a tender touch
Last man committed
You were victimized and it hurt so much

Baby give me your love
I know this is serious
You're so tired of playing games
Now it's just the two of us
And darling that's never gonna change

Cause I'll be the last man committed
Whatever I start baby I'll finish
The last man committed
I'm gonna treat you right every single minute
Last man committed
Forget the past honey let's get with it

Baby give me your love...

I'll be the last man committed
Whatever I start baby I'll finish
The last man committed
I'm gonna treat you right every single minute
Last man committed
Forget the past honey let's get with it

Baby give me your love...
Give me your love...

Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
Let it take me where it wants to go
Another one horse town, another damned old rodeo

I know this life is crazy
But I'll be home soon baby

I'll ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on
Like a cowboy

I keep your picture tucked inside my old hat
It brings me luck, I need a bunch of that
This midnight winding road runs through my blood
I can't give it up, like I said I would

I know it's hard on you
But like I always do

I'll ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on
Like a cowboy

I'll ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy

Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind


I've been burning bright
For so long I can't remember
Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
Believe me when I say, I can't stay this high forever
This man has had all he can stand, time to lay this body down


Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
Sweet Annie


Sweet Annie
I know I promised you life
But with an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weight
If I could take back yesterday, find a way to start it over
Turn around, put that bottle down and I pray it's not too late


Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
What will be will be
Sweet Annie


Sweet Annie
Turn out the light
These hands are made to hold you
Fall all over you
All over again
Come a little closer so I can show you
My heart still beats fast for you
All over, and over again



You got a great apartment
And a real nice car
The job you've always wanted
You're gonna go far
You got everything you need in this world
But you got the wrong girl

Everybody's looking cause she looks so hot
You don't know it yet but
I know what you've got
Go ahead and give it a whirl
But you got the wrong girl

If you're looking for love
You're looking too hard
You can't see that what you need
Is right in your back yard
You were blinded by diamonds
And you've missed a pearl
Yeah, you got the wrong girl

Does she like fishing
Four-wheeling in the woods
Will she get her hands greasy
Up underneath the hood
I bet she never listens to Merle
Yeah, you got the wrong girl

If you're looking for love
You're looking too hard
You can't see that what you need
Is right in your back yard
You were blinded by diamonds
And you've missed a pearl
You got the wrong girl

Yeah you got the wrong girl
Yeah you got the wrong girl
You got the wrong girl
Yeah you got the wrong girl
(fades)

He Will, She Knows
(Steve Leslie/Frank Rogers)

A two room house on an acre lot
It ain't much, but it's all they got
Boy, sometimes it sure seems a lot
To keep up on her own
Pile of bills, a load of clothes
Wipin' tears from a two year old
Makin' sure supper's on before he makes it home

In her mind she hears him say
I'm gonna make it better someday
He will, she knows
He's going to build their dreams a little further down the road
Her faith, it shows
Even if the whole world says he won't
He will

He spends all day underneath the hood
Makin' Chevrolets run like they should
He don't like it much, but the pay is good
And that's enough to make him stay
He's workin' lots of overtime
Cause he's got a little plan in mind
For a hill off Highway 109, that he drives by everyday
Sometimes money's hard to save
But if anyone can find a way

He will, she knows
He's going to build their dreams a little further down the road
Her faith, it shows
Even if the whole world says he won't
He will, she knows

And every night he holds her close and she believes
If anyone can make it more than just a dream

He will, she knows
He's going to build their dream a little further down the road
Her faith, it shows
Oh, it shows
Even if the whole world says he won't
He will, oh he will
He will
Yes, he will
She knows

Lay down with me;
Let me ease your mind
Don't start thinkin':
Baby, we ain't got time
No we ain't got time

Hold me, baby, right up till dawn
Hello sunshine:
Doodle, do, de, ooh, do:
Listen to the birds sing
Feels so right, there ain't nothin' wrong
An' it's so damn easy:
Call it what you want to
Nothin' but a love thing

Rock me, baby:
Take me round the world
I'm your man an'
I'm here to please you, girl:
I'm here to please you, little girl

Hold me, baby, right up till dawn
Hello sunshine:
Doodle, do, de, ooh, do:
Listen to the birds sing
Feels so right, there ain't nothin' wrong
An' it's so damn easy:
Call it what you want to
Nothin' but a love thing

Instrumental break

This kind of thing comes from Heaven above
An' I just can't get enough
No, I can't get enough

Hold me, baby, right up till dawn
Hello sunshine:
Doodle, do, de, ooh, do:
Listen to the birds sing
Feels so right, there ain't nothin' wrong
An' it's so damn easy:
Call it what you want to
Nothin' but a love thing

Hold me, baby, (Hold me, baby.)
Right up till dawn. (Right up till dawn.)
Hello sunshine:
Doodle, do, de, ooh, do:
Listen to the birds sing
Feels so right, (Feels so right.)
There ain't nothin' wrong. (Ain't nothin' wrong.)
An' it's so damn easy:
Call it what you want to
Nothin' but a love thing, y'all

I have never had an easy life
But I'm not complaining
It has taught me how to stand and fight
For what I believe in
I guess that's just how I was raised
I find it hard to walk away

I will not back down
When you push me to the wall
Expecting me to fall
I will not give in
I am not afraid to fight
For what I know is right
I can only take so much
And when I've had enough
It's not in my blood to just lay down
I will hold my ground

I try my best to get through every day
Without confrontation
Stayin' out of everybody's way
But then on occasion
Somebody steps across the line
And it's not too long before they find

Not it's not in my blood to just lay down

I will hold my ground
Yeah I will hold my ground
I will hold my ground
I will hold my ground
I will hold my ground




In my truck flying down a dirt road
Pickin' you up, feelin' kinda crazy
I think I'm in luck cause I know my baby
She slaps my knee says: "boy why you smiling?"
Doing my best so hard to hide it
I know what's up, so I just shoot her a wink


Cause when the sun goes down it'll get a little hotter
Make an old boy's heart beat a little harder
I know I can't lose cause it's going down smooth tonight, baby
One ain't enough man may I have another Sitting 'round the fire gettin' drunk on each other
Every day I pray I thank God I got her She's the moon in my shine, the whiskey in my water


When we're past Flint Bridge, we'll break out the bottle
Drop it down low, crank up the throttle I'm good to go, cause I've got you tonight baby


Cause when the sun goes down it'll get a little hotter
Make an old boy's heart beat a little harder
I know I can't lose cause it's going down smooth tonight, baby
One ain't enough man may I have another Sitting 'round the fire gettin' drunk on each other
Every day I pray I thank God I got her She's the moon in my shine, the whiskey in my water


Sitting on this hill with her
Looking in them baby blues
Wishing that the sky would change
I've been thinking about it all damn day
I can hardly wait


Cause when the sun goes down it'll get a little hotter
Make an old boy's heart beat a little harder
I know I can't lose cause it's going down smooth tonight baby
One ain't enough man may I have another Sitting 'round the fire gettin' drunk on each other
Every day I pray I thank God I got her She's the moon in my shine, the whiskey in my water


Whiskey in my water
Whiskey in my water yeah yeah yeah


No if, and's, but's or maybe's
So you want to be her baby
I can read your face like a book
Yeah it looks easy to love her but believe me brother
It's harder than it looks


She's as pretty as a picture
Every bit as funny as she is smart
Got a smile that'll hold you together
And a touch that'll tear you apart
When she's yours she brings the sunshine
When she's gone the world goes dark
Yeah she's heaven on the eyes
But boy she's hell on the heart


Yeah she's good when she's bad
She's cute when she's mad
And she does all the wrong things right
Yeah boy it's a fact when they're made like that
You ain't ever gonna sleep at night




Once you feel her touch and you've felt that rush
It's going to mess up your head
But here's the kicker son
Your old ticker's going to beat you half to death



Hey, Mr. President
I don't think I'd want your job
I can barely handle the simple one I got
Hey, Mr. President
How cool is Air Force one?
Are those guys in the house and the senate
Ever gonna get anything done?
I ain't no Democrat
I ain't no Republican
We're fathers and mothers
We're wives and husbands
And we pray that we dance
At our daughters' weddings
And our sons grow to fine men
And for peace on our land
Hey, Mr. President
How 'bout that money I sent?
Must take a lot of port barrels
Just to run the government
Hey, Mr. President
Our kids in the Middle East
I guess you gotta fight sometimes
To find a way to keep the peace
I ain't no Democrat
I ain't no Republican
Were fathers and mothers
Sisters and brothers
Wives and husbands
And we pray that we dance
At our daughters' weddings
And our sons grow to fine men
And for peace on our land
I cannot imagine
How hard it must be
To tell some soldier's mother
They died for their country
Mr. President, won't you thank her for me?
Hey, Mr. President
Do you ever feel alone?
Surrounded by all those ghosts in the White House
Bet you wish you could move back home
We ain't just Democrats
We ain't just Republicans
It's all for one and one for all
We're all Americans
And we pray that we see our children's children
And our sons grow to old men
And for peace, yeah, peace on our land
Hey, Mr. President

I still remember the night we met
You said you loved my smile
But your love for me was like a summer breeze
Oh, it lasted for a while
I could hold on a little tighter I know
But when you love someone you gotta let 'em go so

I'm gonna smile, 'cause I want to make you happy
Laugh, so you can't see me cry
I'm gonna let you go in style
And even if it kills me
I'm gonna smile

Kiss me once for the good times, baby
Kiss me twice for goodbye
You can't help how you don't feel
And it doesn't matter why
Give me a chance to bow out gracefully
'Cause that's how I want you to remember me

I'm gonna smile, 'cause I want to make you happy
Laugh, so you can't see me cry
I'm gonna let you go in style
And even if it kills me
I'm gonna smile

I'm gonna smile so you can find the courage
Laugh, so you won't see me hurtin'
I'm gonna let you go in style
And even if it kills me
I'm gonna smile...

Monday morning is such a rush uh-uh uh yeah
Here it is again sneaking up on us uh-uh uh yeah
This is the part you know I don't like
We say goodbye and then we kiss goodnight uh-uh uh yeah
I know it's one o'clock and you said you would be gone by 10
So much for those 8 hours I swore that I'd get in

Chorus:
I know I should get some sleep
I am at the beginning of another long week
But I don't want you to go
No i dont want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Cuz I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go

We always say just one more kiss uh-uh uh yeah, uh-uh uh yeah
But it always seems to never end like this uh-uh uh yeah, uh-uh uh yeah
A few dozen and a couple more
Before we know it its after 4
I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Cause here we go again watching the sun come up

Chorus

I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Because here we go again
Watching the sun come up oh yeah

Chorus

Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm

Smooth
Like a Tennessee Walker
Just a walking on the water
You're smooth
Like a Sunday morning Elvis
Singing Gospel it's a hell of a
Groove
Like the lines on her Mercury
Girl you're put together perfectly

Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
That do me like you
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth

Like cat daddy driving
A Caddy from Cali baby
You're smooth
Like young love buzzing
Off an old camp bottle by the
Moon
Blackberry jam, finger-licking
Off your hand flying out the window

Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
(There ain't nobody)
That do me like you
(Do me like you)
The way you move that body
(The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth
(So smooth)
Smooth, smooth

You're a stroke on the canvas
A brick road to Kansas
My little summer time jam

Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
(There ain't nobody)
That do me like you
(Do me like you)
The way you move that body
(The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth
(So smooth)
Smooth, smooth
(You so smooth)
Smooth

Turn to the six o'clock news, another soldier dies
Tried to hide it but I couldn't help it, I had to cry
When my little boy asked me daddy was he your friend
I said no, I didn't even know him

But he was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone

So I sat there in that chair and helped him understand
How this brave young man gave his life for our land
And although he's someone we'll never know
To you and me he is a hero

He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone

To the world he was a total stranger
Who kept us safe and out of danger
But now he's just a picture on TV
Somebody's memory

He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone

He was somebody's someone...

Where in the world did you come from
Seems like I looked up
And there you were
Didn't think about it then
But when I look back
I believe now
That miracles do occur

'Cause I can reach up
And touch any star in the sky
Put my arms round the moon if I try

Never thought I could feel
So much love in my life
No, I never thought I'd know how
But I do now

Is this a dream
Or are you real
I'm trying hard not to lose my cool
But when you're kissing me
I just get so lost in the moment
I hope I'm not acting
Like some kind of fool

'Cause I can reach up
And touch any star in the sky
Put my arms round the moon if I try

Never thought I could feel
So much love in my life
No, I never thought I'd know how
But I do now

Never had no one to miss me
Never had no one
Who kissed me like you
Never had no one
Who loved me like you

I can reach up and touch
Any star in the sky
Put my arms round the moon if I try

Never thought I could feel
So much love in my life
No, I never thought
I'd know how
But I do now

No, I haven't seen the sky tonight
Too many clouds, there's no starlight
But I know it's true
There must be a blue moon

I got the message you left early today
No signs, no warnings to give you away
Not even goodbye
It was the only way

There's a blue moon out tonight
No, I don't see it but I feel its light
Come pouring through the clouds you left above my head
There's a blue moon out tonight
No misconceptions, yes, I know it's right
'cause I've never been so blue in all my life

No, don't call a friend 'cause nobody should know
It's just between me, my heart and my soul
And the memories perfectly placed in my mind
The more I think it over, well, the more I know it's true
The reason you left me, why I'm feeling so blue…
There must be a blue moon

There's a blue moon out tonight
No, I don't see it but I feel its light
Come pouring through the clouds you left above my head
There's a blue moon out tonight
No misconceptions, yes, I know it's right
'cause I've never been so blue in all my life

There's a blue moon out tonight
No misconceptions, yes, I know it's right
'cause I've never been so blue in all my life

No, I haven't seen the sky tonight
Too many clouds, there's no starlight
But I know it's true
There must be a blue moon

We're up when the rooster crows
Clock in when the whistle blows
Eight hours ticking slow
And then tomorrow
We'll do it all over again

I'm a member of a blue collar crowd
They can never, no they can't keep us down
If you gotta, gotta label me
Label me 'proud'

I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class

We laugh, we cry, we love
Go hard when the going's tough
Push back on push and shove
Knock us down, we'll get back up again and again

I'm a member of a good timing crowd
We get rowdy, we get wild and loud
If you gotta, gotta label me
Label me proud

I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class

We all know why we're here
A little fun, a little music
A little whiskey, a little beer
We going to shake off those long week blues
Ladies, break out your dancing shoes
It don't matter what night it is, it's Friday
It's Saturday, it's Sunday
I just wanna hear you say
I just wanna hear you singing
Y'all Sing it with me

We belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
We belong to the drinking class


If you're telling me I'm not on fire
You're just preaching to the choir
I've gotten dull as old barbed wire from living
Last night I watched the evening news
It was the same old, nothing new
It should have cut me right in two
But it didn't
I don't know why it didn't


But I want to feel something
Something that's a real something
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
I want a heart that beats and bleeds
A heart that's busting at the seams
I want to care, I want to cry, I want to scream
I just want to feel something


If you're telling me that's just how it is
I don't buy it because once I was kissed
By a red-headed girl with cherry lips
On her porch when I was sixteen
And I felt it somewhere in my soul and time stood still and I couldn't let go
I can't tell you because I don't know how I got so cold
When did I get so cold




I hate that I'm jaded and I make you cry
But still you stick around me, only God knows why
Damn it all to hell, I'm done
Because I don't like what I've become
So come here, baby
Come here, baby




Come here, baby


I'm dreamin' tonight of a place I love
Even more then I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you


I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree


Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light beams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams




Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light beams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
I'll be there, I'll be there
If only in my dreams


I felt the rush of the Rio Grande into Yellowstone
And I've seen first-hand Niagra Falls
And the lights of Vegas
I've criss-crossed down to Key Biscayane
And Chi-town via Bangor, Maine
Think I've seen it all
And all I can say is


How 'bout them cowgirls
Boys ain't they somthing
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now girls
May just be seven wonders of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls


She's a ridin' colts in Steamboat Springs
Bailing hay outside Abilene
She's trying hard
To fit in some city
But her home is 'neath that big, blue sky
And the Northern Plains and those other wide open spaces




Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me
She can do just fine on her own two feet
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide
Her stubborn will or her fighting side
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no on else


Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls
Boys ain't they something
Sure some are proud girls
But you can't beat their loving
And I'll tell you right now girls
May just be seven wonders of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls
How 'bout them boys


A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma


Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?


They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states


I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat


On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky

You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states


Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
(Yeah)


Have you ever been through Indiana?
On the plains of Oklahoma?
Take a ride


Made me grow
Then you cut me down
A north wind on a garden growing
You made me think you were mine
Then you changed your mind
I'm lost as a feather
In a hurricane
There's no way to measure
If I'll ever OK, OK let me tell you


There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along


And it was all alright
Now it's all, all wrong
That's just how
It goes when you're gone


You may not realize
All the lies at the time but
The truth will find you
Storm is going to come
Going to wash you away like Sodom and Gomorrah


There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along


And it was all alright
Now it's all, all wrong
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong




Go out in circles
Like an old golden bed
As cold as the pillow
By your empty nightstand
Then something comes over me
I lose my head
I guess god did not make me
A one woman man


I'd have a lot to give
If I still gave a damn
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong


And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
But that's just how
It goes when you're gone


And it was all alright
Now it's all wrong
And that's just how
It goes when you're gone
When you're gone
When you're long long gone

(Verse 1)
I just got off, work at 5, drivin' that 'ol van I drive, overalls, and dirty boots, but Uncle Bill needed a funeral suit, so when I walked in that fancy store, they looked at me like I was poor, but a wad of hundred dollar bills caused a stir, it went from "don't take checks" to "right away yes sir"

(Chorus)
Upper middle class white trash, my pockets can't hold all my cash, cause one day I stopped to pee, got some gas and won the lottery, now I've invested in my neighborhood, my friends and family, there all livin pretty good, a trailer park full of Cadillac's, an upper middle class white trash

(Verse 2)
I got my home-boy Chris, a brand new shop, for all those cars on cinder blocks, and cousin Charlie thinks its cool to keep a large mouth bass in his new swimmin' pool, I had a birth day party for mama last night, in her ninety and a half foot triple wide, you ain't seen nothin' if you ain't seen NASCAR on a sixty inch plasma screen!

(Chorus)
Upper middle class white trash, my pockets can't hold all my cash, cause one day I stopped to pee, got some gas and won the lottery, now I've invested in my neighborhood, my friends and family, there all livin pretty good, a trailer park full of Cadillac's, an upper middle class white trash

(Bridge)
Buyin' chicken wings buy the buckets, we can't eat 'em all so we just say chuck it, all the miller light you can handle, a hundred and fifty seven movie channels…

(Chorus)
Upper middle class white trash, our pockets can't hold all our cash, cause one day I stopped to pee, got some gas and won the lottery, now I've invested in my neighborhood, my friends and family, there all livin pretty good, a trailer park full of Cadillac's, an upper middle class white trash

Well it feels like slow motion, I hear the gun explode
I see the flash that brings me to my knees
And I feel the warmth flowing out of me

But in my mind, I'm climbing up the stairs
And walking down the hall and Heather's standing there
October 99, I see us in New England in the Fall
Our love will last forever like that 8X10
Hanging on Heather's wall, hanging on Heather's wall

I see the money on the floor and his gun there by the door
He was trying to rob the bank when I walked in
Oh but this is not the way it's s'pose to end

But in my mind, I'm climbing up the stairs
And walking down the hall and Heather's standing there
October 99, I see us in New England in the fall
Our love will last forever like that 8X10
Hanging on Heather's wall, hanging on Heather's wall

Oh somewhere, someone says, "We've lost him now"
But I look up and I see Heather's smile
So how can I be dying?

When I'm climbing up the stairs
And walking down the hall, and I see a bright light there
October 99, that picture of New England in the fall
Our love will last forever like that 8X10
Hanging on Heather's Wall, hanging on Heather's Wall

Here we go boys, whoo!
It ain't the truck, it ain't the tractor
That gives a country boy his X-factor
It ain't how we roll that gets you where you wanna go
It ain't the horse, it ain't the barn
That keeps you comin' back to the farm
For a little more E-I-E-I-OH
It ain't the grits, it ain't the gravy
It's that slow southern draw, callin' you baby
That's what our women love about country livin'
Now listen up!
It ain't the boots, it ain't the hat
That makes a real cowboy all that
An 8 second ride ain't the way I rodeo
Giddy-up!
It ain't the ribs or mama's chicken
It's another recipe that keeps ya finger-lickin'
That's what our women love about country livin'
That's what our women love about country livin'
Ah, you shake it girl
The fields are green, the skies are blue
From that ole hayloft it's quite a view
When we get hot we just go skinny dippin'
That's what our women love about country livin'
That's what our women love about country livin'
That's what our women love about country livin'
Women love country livin'
Women love country livin'
Women love country livin'
Women love country livin'
Women love country livin'
Bring it on in here, girls
Women love country livin'
C'mon! Women love country livin'
(Oh, I think I here ya mama callin')
Women love country livin'
(Tell her you ain't never comin' home)
Women love, women love country livin', yeah

One, two, here we go with the attitude, yeah, hey
I been up an' down, sideways, crossways
Outside in an' inside out
I took a rocky ride across the sky
Couple times, till the fire burned out
Well, I hit the ground a time or two
But I got back up an' I found the truth
An' said "Hey, ol' Wynonna got somethin' to say"
Oh, whoa, you know I know what I'm talkin' about
There's two ways to take what this ol' life's gonna throw at you
You can choose to win or lose, it's all about attitude, yeah, chop
Well, this world has tried to break me, shake me
Tried to take the fight outta me, ha ha
But I've always come back bigger, badder, better
Always land on my feet, ha that's right
Well, I coulda given up, coulda got down, down, down, down
Well, I kept on swingin' an' I went another round
Hey, ol' Wynonna got somethin' to say
Oh, whoa, you know I know what I'm talkin' about
There's two ways to take what this ol' life's gonna throw at you
You can choose to win or lose, it's all about attitude, yeah that's right
Yeah, yeah can I got a witness?
Well, you can lay down
(Lay down)
You can roll on over
(Roll on over)
Get outta the way
(Get outta the way)
Or you can move that mountain over
Say, hey, well, this redhead's got somethin' to say
Whoa, you know I know what I'm talkin' about
There's two ways to take what this ol' world's gonna throw at you
Yeah, it all comes down to you an attutude, yeah, yeah


I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Act like we never met before for fun, cause


You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you


The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah


So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, cause


You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you


Yeah, I'm here to pick you up
And I hope I don't let you down, no, cause


You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you


You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you


I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor

I've been broken, torn and scattered
I've loved holy, I've loved sin
I was rolling on the wind
It didn't matter

I was so sure of who I didn't want to be
Every smile and every fear
Every laugh and every tear
It was all mine, it was all me

Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that I'm gonna be
I don't even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am
Pieces

We've all been lied to
We've all been liars
Nothing's perfect in this world
Everybody's been burned by the fire
Guess I'm learning
That what breaks you, makes you grow
But I'm not hiding where I've been
Gonna let the light shine in
What I don't need
Gonna let that, let that, let that go

Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that I'm gonna be
I don't even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am
Pieces

Pieces, the good and the bad
Pieces, the happy and sad
Pieces, the wrong and the right
Pieces, that's my, that's my, that's my life

Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that I'm gonna be
I don't even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am
Pieces

Pieces, pieces


Pick a switch, read the bible
Hunt and fish for survival
Plant a seed, watch it grow
Learn to trust which way the wind blows
Let your mama know you love her
You will never have another


Daddy, I have not forgotten
Lessons learned under the light of a Southern, starry sky
Family's the light that guides us
Blessed be the ties that bind us
Sweet by and by
Sweet by and by


Tell the truth, earn your dollar
Let not your heart asunder
Save yourself, believe in faith
Good things come to those who wait
Let your daddy know you love him
You will never have another


Momma, I have not forgotten
Lessons learned under the light of a Southern, starry sky
Family's the light that guides us
Blessed be the ties that bind us
Sweet by and by
Sweet by and by


Daddy, I have not forgotten
Lessons learned under the light of a Southern, starry sky
Momma I have not forgotten
Lessons learned under the light of a Southern, starry sky
Sweet by and by
Sweet by and by

You can see it from the river
To the top of white pine ridge
Burning like a summer sun
A bunch of rednecks getting half lit
There's mud-covered trucks and suvs
Cranking out Hank and AC/DC

At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods, homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig
Hold up your cup and take another swig
Won't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire
At the bonfire

Everybody sees the headlights
When old Sheriff John pulled up
We all got a little nervous
It's too late to hide our cups
He pops a top and hollers real loud
Dont worry yall i came to hang out

At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods, homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig
Hold up your cup and take another swig
Won't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire
At the bonfire

You dont have to be from around here
To know right where to go
All you gotta do is load up
And head towards glow

At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods, homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig
Hold up your cup and take another swig
Won't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire
At the bonfire

At the bonfire


I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
I thought I loved you then


Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then


I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then




I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before


Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
We'll look back someday
At this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then


And I thought I loved you then

Callin' all girlfriends, spring break weekend
Meetin' at the texaco
Wine cooler's six packs, cigerattes and tic-tac's
Fill it up and hit the road
Passin' around the cosmo, wearin out the cell phone

Flip flops and lip gloss, bikini tops and cut off's
Baby let the game's begin

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight


Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away


Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more


Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now




Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
Oh and have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Wake up to a sunny day
not a cloud up in the sky
then it starts to rain.

My defenses hit the ground
and they shatter all around
so open and exposed.

But I found strength in the struggle
Face to face with my trouble.


When you're broken
in a million little pieces
and you're trying
but you can't hold on any more.
Every tear falls down for a reason
Don't you stop believing in yourself
when you're broken.

Little girl don't be so blue
I know what you're going through
don't let it beat you up.

Hitting walls and getting scars
only makes you who you are
only makes you who you are.

No matter how much you're heart is aching
there is beauty in the breaking.

Yeah




Better days are gonna find you once again
every piece will find it's place

When you're broken
oh when you're broken



when you're broken
when you're broken


Love how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer
Tonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do


I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you


Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah you know what gets me
I'm talking slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on


I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you


I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you


I need Jesus or I need whiskey
Whatever works best to get me through
Gettin' over you


A little Friday night hallelujah
A congregation of backsliders just like me
Yeah, what I need


Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church


Baptize me in that barroom smoke
Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more
Ain't that what this place is for?


I tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'
But damn did that hurt don't just keep hangin' around
What I need right now


Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church


Just a-sippin' down that unholy water
Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow
I'll stay here all night


In a neon church
With the party crowd
Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling


I need a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church
I need a neon church


Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore


And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time


It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now


Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before


And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time


It's a quarter after one, I'm little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now


Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all


It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now


I just need you now
Oh, baby, I need you now

Young ones in the jailhouse sleeping it off
Church folks saying that his soul is lost
Man you shoulda seen him, all the faces turned red
Yep, when the preacher stood up and said
The only thing different in sinners and saints
One is forgiven and the other one ain't

--- Instrumental ---

Sally got in trouble a few years ago
With a married man down in Tupelo
The way folks talked in this little old town
Lord, there ain't no way she's ever gonna live it down
The only thing different in sinners and saints
One is forgiven and the other one ain't

--- Instrumenrtal ---

Nobody's perfect, we're just flesh and blood
One foot on the high road, one in the mud
There's a mighty fine line between right and wrong
Don't point your finger, don't matter which side you're on
The only thing different in sinners and saints
One is forgiven and the other one ain't

The only thing different in sinners and saints
One is forgiven and the other one ain't
One is forgiven and the other one ain't...


Eighteen wheeler dropped me off at that city limits sign
Sunday morning sunlight hurt my eyes
It's a long way from where I been back to my home town
But there's a man in me I need to drown


Baptize me in that muddy water
Wash me clean in amazing grace
I haven't been living like I ought to
Baptize me in that muddy water


Made my way to the church at the end of the dirt road
Dragging what was left of my soul
I could see the saints out back on the river bank
And I could hear forgiveness calling out my name




Baptize me in that muddy water
Yeah, wash me clean, that muddy water, water
In that muddy water
Baptize me

You say you want space
A little time on your own
To clear out your mind
Really unwind, and just be alone

Things are moving too fast, going too far
Getting too close, too close to the heart

And now you want space
Well I'll give you space
Plenty of space, all the space that you need

Does it make you feel free, make you feel young?
How does it feel not to need anyone?
You say you want space
Well I'll give you space

You need your own bed
You need your own room
Well how 'bout an island?
I bet you could find one
On the dark side of the moon

Then you won't have to deal with anything real
Cause I won't be here, I'll just disappear

And you can have space
Honey, I'll give you space
Plenty of space, all the space that you need

Does it make you feel free, make you feel young?
How does it feel not to need anyone?
Oh, you say you want space
Baby, you can have space
I'll give you


Confetti falling from the sky
My hometown on the 4th of July
A midnight snow on Christmas Eve
Like standing up for what you believe


That's how I feel when I'm with you
That's how I feel when I'm with you
That's how I feel
That's how I feel when I'm with you


Your lucky coat, the first day of fall
When you wake up laughing just because
An old church door that stays wide open
A perfect heart that's never been broken




That's how I feel when I'm with you
Every day there's something new
To cry about, to laugh about
Those moments I can't live without
That's how I feel
That's how I feel
When I'm with you

It says here your from Houston
Certified to drive a truck
It didn't say what ou've been doing
The last five years
Then I watched his eyes keep readin
Then I watched his eyes look up
Mustive known the job I needed
Cause when you get to the line
When you've been convicted of a crime
He said Thanks for comming in
I'll call you back
Well, I ain't asking for every job
Under the sun
I just want one, second chance

On August 22nd, little Jacobs turning 5
But his momma moved him 1/2 a state away
I left another message
On the phone late last night
She finally had her lawyer call today
She knows I can't afford to take this thing to court
And I'm trying hard to make her understand
Well, I ain't askin for every weekend
Of every month
I just want one, second chance

I was young and I was stupid
I regret it everyday
Ain't saying I didn't do it
But I paid for my mistakes
It's a lost and empty feeling
When they dont want you around
Yea, I finally got the freedom
But what good is it now?

There are somedays when it feels like it's been 100 yrs
Sometimes it only seems like yesterday
We were painting Jacobs nursery
Counting the days till he was here
Next thing I knew I was throwing it all away
Now I know I can't go back
To the life I used to have
When I stood and held the whole world in my hands

I had a job
I had a wife
I had a son
I just want one
Second chance


He can't remember the times that he thought
Does my daddy love me? Probably not
That didn't stop him from wishing that he did
Didn't keep him from wanting or worshipping him


He guesses he saw him about once a year
He could still feel the way he felt standing in tears
Stretching his arms out as far as they'd go
And whispering daddy, I want you to know


I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
How ever long it takes, I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much


He grew to hate him for what he had done
'Cause what kind of father could do that to his son?
He said 'damn you, daddy' the day that he died
The man didn't blink, but the little boy cried


I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
How ever long it takes, I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much


Half way through the service
While the choir sang the hymn
He looked up above the preacher
And he sat and stared at him


He said 'Forgive me father' when he realized
That he hadn't been unloved or alone all his life
His arms were stretched out as far as they go
Nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know


I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
How ever long it takes, I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much

Boy, don't wait, don't think
Don't lock the door behind you
Run and jump into your truck
And hit the gas, burn some rubber up
Yeah, your time's running out, do it now

Take a shortcut, take a back road
Take the shoulder to the exit
Skip the parking, screw the ticket
Hit the curb and leave it sitting
Whatever it takes, you gotta get to that gate

She's crying on a suitcase
Sitting at the airport, waiting on the airplane
'Bout to take her out of here

They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky

You better run while you've still got time
She's crying on a suitcase

Admit it boy, you blew it, really messed it up
You can make excuses if you really wanna lose her
It's all on the line, do or die time
Getting on your knees time

Tell her that you want her
Need her, love her, gotta have her
Everything good in your life
Begins and ends with her
Lose your pride while you can
Come on, man, be a man

She's crying on a suitcase
Sitting at the airport, waiting on the airplane
'Bout to take her out of here

They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky

You better run while you've still got time
She's crying on a suitcase

She's crying on a suitcase
Waiting on the airplane
'Bout to take her out of here

They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky

You better run while you've still got time
While you've still got time

She's crying on a suitcase
Waiting on the airplane
She'll fade into a goodbye sky


Just hear those sleigh bells ring-a-ling
Ting, ting, ting-a-ling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you


Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
It's grand just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintery fairyland


Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you


There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fire place while we'll watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print of Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we'll remember
All through our lives


Just hear those sleigh bells ring-a-ling
Ting, ting, ting-a-ling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you


Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
It's grand just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintery fairyland


Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you


Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

The first thing I did when that plane finally landed was kiss the ground
The next thing I did was to go find my friends down at the old hangout
Drank some beer and talked a lot about old times
But when the booze finally hit Billy Joe Grimes
He said I don't know what it is, but you seem different to me

I said I just came back from a place where they hated me
And everything I stand for
A land where our brothers are dying for others who don't even care anymore
If I'm not exactly the same good old boy that you ran around with before
I just came back from a war

The very next morning I took a walk through the neighborhood
I thought it's been so long since I've been in a place where everything is good
People laughing and children were playing
And as I watched em I found myself praying
Lord keep em safe here at home in the land of the free

Cuz I just came back from a place where they hated me
And everything I stand for
A land where our brothers are dying for others who don't even care anymore
If I'm not same little freckled face boy
That grew up in that house next door
I just came back from a war

I hope you cherish this sweet way of life
And I hope you know that it comes with a price

I just came back from a place where they hated me
And everything I stand for
A land where our brothers are dying for others who don't even care anymore
Chances are I never will be the same
I really don't know anymore
I just came back from a war

I just came back from a war


You dont know me (repeated)

There was black and white
Now I'm on a sea of gray
I was satisfied
Now there's just an empty space
I know only you hold just what I'm lookin' for
What I'm lookin' for

Do I pray for sweet redemption
What am I supposed to do
Now do I wait for some direction
Or do I just feel my way to you

What I'm searching for
Is just something more than this
I've opened every door
There must be something that I missed
Am I even close to the road that leads to you
Road that leads to you

Do I pray for sweet redemption
What am I supposed to do
Now do I wait for some direction
Or do I just feel my way to you

Do I just feel my way to you

Do I pray for sweet redemption
What am I supposed to do
Now do I wait for some direction
Or do I just feel my way to you
Feel my way to you
Do I just feel my way to you
Do I just feel my way
Do I just feel my way to you


He's just a singer, a natural born guitar ringer
Kind of a clinger, to sad ole songs
He's not a walk behinder, he's a new note finder
His name's a reminder, of a blues man that's already gone


So he started drinkin', took some things that messed up his thinkin'
He was sure sinkin', when she came along
He was alone in the spot light, not too much left in sight
She changed all that one night, when she sang him this song


Hey baby I love you, hey baby I need you
Hey baby you ain't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho man
You've wasted so much of your life, runnin' through the dark nights
Let me shine a little love light, down on that blues man


He got so sick from speedin', all the things they said he was needin'
If he is to keep on pleasin', all of his fans
He got cuffed on dirt roads, he got sued over no shows
She came and took all that ole load, down off that blues man

And he said...


Hey baby I love you too, hey baby I need you
Hey, baby I do get tired, of this travellin band
I'm over 40 years old now, nights would be cold now
If you hadn't stuck it out, with this blues man


He's over 40 years old now, nights would be so cold now
If she hadn't hung around, with that blues man

Why'd you call me today with nothing new to say?
You pretend it's just hello, but you know what it does to me to see your number on the phone
Now tell me, what do you want? What do you want? What do you want from me?
Are you tryin' to bring back the tears or just the memories?
You keep takin' me back, takin' me back where I've already been
When we hang up it's almost like I'm losing you again
Can't you see? So what do you want, what do you want from me?

I get so tired of living like this
I don't have the time, neither do my friends
To stay up at night, to pull me through
And to find the things to keep my mind off of you

So, now tell me, what do you want? What do you want? What do you want from me?
Did you call to say you've found someone and I'm a used- to- be
You keep takin' me back, takin' me back where I've already been
If you've moved on why does it feel like I'm losing you again?
Can't you see? So what do you want? What do you want from me?

What do you want me to say?
That I'm content? That I'm on the fence? That I wish you would've stayed?
Oh baby what do you want, what do you want, what do you want from me?
To come here and make love tonight cause you're feelin' lonely
You keep takin' me back, takin' me back where I've already been
When we wake up and say goodbye it's like I'm losing you again
Can't you see? So what do you want, what do you want from me?
What do you want, what do you want from me?

She could be the first female president
Or be the doctor who's experiment
Finds the cure to what she's in here for
But right now treatments keep her sick in bed
That baseball cap never leaves her head
And while she sleeps I sit and dream
One day I asked her what do you wanna do when you grow up
I soon found out I wasn't dreaming big enough

She said, I'm gonna ride my bike, I'm gonna climb a tree
Gonna fly a kite, score running little league
I'm gonna go to school, make a friend, be able to run again

Take off my mask and just breathe in the air
But most of all I'm gonna braid my hair

She could question God, Lord, knows I would
She could just give up, I don't think I could be that strong or fight so long
How can such a little girl have such big faith
And even through the pain she still prays, saying, God will make a way

For me to ride my bike, for me to climb a tree
I'm gonna fly a kite, and score running little league
I'm gonna go to school, make a friend, be able to run again
And take off my mask and just breathe in the air
But most of all I'm gonna braid my hair that's down to my waist
Then I'll get it cut so they can make
Locks of love for some little girl who's just like me
Wonders if she'll ever be

Able to ride her bike, able to climb a tree
Able to fly her kite, and score running little league
Able to go to school, make new friends, be able to run again
Take off her mask and just breathe in the air
And most of all she can braid her hair
She can braid her hair


You put me on a roller coaster, fly me on a plane
You send me to another planet, get inside my brain
I knew right when I met you, I would never be the same
But I let you take me over, girl, so I'm the one to blame


You make all my screws come loose
Got me perfectly confused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Lose my mind


You make me crazy and I kinda like it
You show that apple, girl, and I wanna bite it
So crazy that I gotta have it
And I never wanna get outta this straight jacket


You make all my screws come loose
Got me perfectly confused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Lose my mind


I feel the walls closing in inside this padded room
Only good thing about it is I'm locked in here with you
I'm always watching you, wondering what you'll do next
But my favorite part about it is, is I always have to guess
(you know I do)


You make all my screws come loose
Got me perfectly confused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind


Last night, I got served
A little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor
And I let him call me baby


And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name


We left the club
Right around three o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should've been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?


And I don't even know his last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!


Today, I woke up
Thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go
I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear
There's just one little problem


I don't even know my last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no! What have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name


What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name
Well, it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, oh


It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Oh, yeah


How do two people like to meet
I think about that
Was the timing just right
Was it that the night was so sweet
I think about that
Was it physical, chemical, what was the deal
Or did some kind of magic turn out to be real


Might be how you kiss and hold me tight
When we're walking, honey, underneath the moonlight
Might be how it keeps on getting better
We haven't even talked about forever
I just know that we're so good together
When did we cross that line
And just happen to find we're in love
I think about that
Was it you, was it me
Who could see we'd turn out to be us
I think about that
We could spend all our time trying to figure it out
And not be any closer than we are right now


I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you


Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never going to leave you
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall


I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh, over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath, then jump, then fall into me
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you


Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never going to leave you
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall


The bottom's going to drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
And people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is going to come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
Whoa oh, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me


Be there, never going to leave you
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall baby
Jump then fall into me, into me


Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah


It was a Friday night
No cover but the cover band was sounding right
But there you were
Just flirty dancing
By the neon sign
To fishing in the dark and
Reeling in my heart
And I look where you are


I'm hooked on kissing and getting
Getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you
All night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and


I was hooked on
The way that you taking
Taking my shirt off
And running my fingers
Through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked


It's Saturday
Still asleep and I could leave, but no way
This ain't a one night fling kinda thing
Wanna wake you up
Wanna press my luck
And my lips on your cheek
Like I can't enough cause


I'm hooked on kissing and getting
Getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you
All night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and


I was hooked on
The way that you taking
Taking my shirt off
And running my fingers
Through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked


I'm hooked on kissing and getting
Getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you
All night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and


I was hooked on
The way that you taking
Taking my shirt off
And running my fingers
Through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked


Now and then
I think about you now and then
When I see that Chevrolet
That certain shade, of blue
I hear that song, the one we sang all summer long
And even though its been so long it brings me back
Right back to you


I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me

How you been I'd love to hear bout how you've been
You're the only broken heart I've ever had, and love to have again


I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me


They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around
Just a few street lights, speed limit signs that all say 25
But those folks ain't lived in our lives


They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know


All they see is tractors, barbwire and tall green grass
Naw they don't see the years spent working, busting their ass
How they pray for rain
They don't know a thing
About what it takes
Livin' this way


They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know
No, they don't know


They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around


They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know
No, they don't know

Hey, one, two, three


Now, red Solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
Hey, red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in 14 years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass
Whoo!


Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party


Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hitting
On them to help me get lucky


Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party


Now, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbott to my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom
Red Solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say


Red Solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no! )
You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend
(Friend, friend, friend,life-long)
Thank you for being my friend


Red Solo cup
(That's what I am talking about)
I fill you up
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

Red Solo cup
Red Solo cup
(I fill you up, let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Red Solo cup)
Oh red Solo cup
(I lift you up)
Let's have a party
Proceed to party yeah yeah


(Solo cup, solo cup, solo cup)
(Solo cup, solo cup, solo cup)
(Solo cup, solo cup)

Verse 1:
So you're the one I've waited on
The one I've been dreaming of
Now that I know, it's hard to let go
I don't want to lose your love

Pre-Chourus:
But what can I do, I can't make you stay here
But if you should choose to go your own way
Where ever you're going, whenever you turn
Remember this moment, remember these words

Chorus
I will, I will give up my life for you if you want it
Give you my heart, you already own it
I'll do anything, I'll go anywhere, it's true
I will, I will, I will…

Verse 2:
I look in your eyes and I see our life
So full of happiness
Do you see the same? Or just someone you'll blame
For things that you might've missed

I don't want to weigh you down like an anchor
If that's how you see me now, I would rather
Let you go free, just sail away
If that's what you need, if that's what it takes

Repeat Chorus

If ever your day is done
Still you feel you need someone to hold you… I will
If you ever need
To talk to somebody who really knows you…. Yes I will

Give up my life for you if you want it
Give you my heart, you already own it
I'll do anything, I'll go anywhere, it's true
I will, I will, I will…

Baby light a couple candles, lock the bedroom door
Put on some sweet soul music, throw a blanket on the floor
Surrender to my patient hands
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

It hit me just this morning, when I passed you in the hall
I swear I caught you lookin, like you dont know me at all
Let me show you who I am
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

And I'll always be, your cover when your cold
And when the world winds up against you, im the safe place you can go
But now and then, we need to find some time to be in love, just be in love

Now the whole worlds in bed sleepin, I think were finally alone
And if the telephone starts ringin, we'll pretend like were not home
Cause any fool would understand
That all week ive been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

Mhhmh, mmhmmmhm

So let me show you who I am
All week ive been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

Just forget about that old wedding band
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man
Mmmhmm


Snapbacks and Levi jeans
PBR and burnt CDs
Running for the grass on the hot concrete
We're still working on our summer feet
Cheap gas and Reddy ice
Trunk music and headlight fights
Dodging the smoke from a riverbank fire
A pretty girl and a pickup line like
"Hey what's your name, you know smoke follows beauty, baby"


We stayed up all night long, made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in, stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it (raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it


Car wash at the custom tent
Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
The only sign that we ever got stuck
Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck
5-1's with a 20 on top
Three guard at the barber shop
Duckin' from your ex at the 4-way stop
Turn the music down when you're passing the cops


We stayed up all night long, made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in, stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it (raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it


Mama's prayers and daddy's speech
Front porch philosophies
A little too young and dumb to see
Just what it all meant to me


We stayed up all night long, made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in, stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it (raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it


Mmm yeah
When that sun starts sinking
When they turn those open signs around
We thought we ran this town
Running around just
Breaking hearts and curfew
Out in the yard with no shoes
Staying cool in a Nylon pool
Foul ball headed for the parking lot
And those Saturday mornings we sleep late
ATVs and fire breaks
Worn out jeans, black eyed peas, backroads and blue skies
I was born and raised on it
Might have misbehaved on it
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made

Out of all the reindeers
You know you're the mastermind
Run run Rudolph
Randolph ain't too far behind

Run run Rudolph
Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph
Cause I'm reelin' like a merry go round

Said Santa to a boy
Child what have you been longing for
All I want for Christmas is a
Rock and roll electric guitar
And then away went Rudolph
Whizzin' like a shootin' star

Run run Rudolph
Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph
Cause I'm reelin' like a merry go round
Run like it's stolen

Said Santa to a girl
Child what would please you most to get
A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink, and wet
And then away went Rudolph
Whizzin' like a saber jet

Run run Rudolph
Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph
Cause I'm reelin' like a merry go round

Run run Rudolph
(Run run Rudolph)
Run run Rudolph
Run run run Rudolph
(Run run Rudolph)
Run run
Run run run Rudolph
(Run run run Rudolph)

Merry Christmas everybody

She slammed the screen door
Kicked up the dust pullin' out of here
Probably headed for Baton Rouge
Her taillights just disappeared
I tried everything within my power to get her to stay
Guess all I can do right now is get on my knees and pray

CHORUS
Maybe she'll get lonely
Maybe she'll turn that wheel around
Maybe she'll miss me
Before she hits the edge of town
Cause I love her I need her
I can't live without her
Yeah the only hope that I've got left is
Maybe she'll get lonely

Right now she's angry
As mad as I've ever seen
And if she makes it a hundred miles
That means she's breakin' free
I think time is of the essence I keep ringin' her phone
It ain't lookin too good right now before she's too far gone

REPEAT CHORUS

Yeah I love her I need her
I miss her I want her
I can't live without her

Maybe she'll get lonely
Maybe she'll get lonely
The only hope that I've got left is
Maybe she'll get lonely
Maybe she'll get lonely

Guess I didn't know how to take it, that night we had that talk
Found out about my replacement, I just smiled and shook it off
I didn't ask you any questions, didn't beg you to stay
You said you knew that I would understand, then I watched you drive away
When there's just no words to stay

I scream at the top of my lungs
Yeah, I come undone
I crash my broken glass when no one's around
I cry out
In the silence I can't take
To cover up the sound it makes when I let my heart break
I scream

I always say the right things, at all the right times
I know I'm not the perfect girl, but for some reason I try
To be the one who's smiling and laughing, to make sure everyone's okay
I can push those tears back inside like an actress on the stage
But when the curtains fall away

I scream at the top of my lungs
Yeah, I come undone
I crash my broken glass when no one's around
I cry out In the silence I can take
To cover up the sound it makes when I let my heart break
I scream, I scream

I can't hold it in no more
I don't feel like playing nice
When I feel like getting loud
I just gotta let it out
I just gotta let it out

I scream at the top of my lungs
Yeah, I come undone
I crash like broken glass when no one's around
I cry out
In the silence I can't take
To cover up the sound it makes when I let my heart break
I scream
I scream
I scream

She stops and checks her reflection in a car parked on the corner
She says its hell on me this working down at the diner
Some people say man she was hot back when she was younger
Yeah well she was a dancer when she lived in LA

Well she was someone's baby doll
A beauty queen to someone long ago
For the midnight show

And if you close your eyes
You can hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
Back when all the world was young
She was someone's baby doll

She stops and checks her reflection in the bathroom on her lunch break
She says "I still look good for someone half of my real age"
Some people say "Man I bet she still makes love like an earthquake"
Yeah but man she ain't easy ... she ain't letting you in my friend, my friend

Its time to wake up baby doll
Put your best dress and your high heals on
And dream your gone

When you close your eyes
You can hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
Back when all the world was young
She was someone's baby doll

She stops and calls an old friend from the payphone at the subway
She says I feel like I'm just sitting here wasting my days away
It's time to move on baby doll
And walk away just like you did before ... when you wanted more

When you close your eyes
You hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
When she was a younger girl ... a pretty heart in a tainted world
Not sure who you wanna be
Your daddy's little drama queen
I hope that when you find yourself
You're more than just a baby doll


You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin', 'cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night


We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down


Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance


We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here dreamin' in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down


I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me (against me)
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me  (against me)


We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down


I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me


I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
I'll stand and place my hand upon my heart
Every time her anthem plays
When I see somebody on TV
Take their stand on bended knee
Whether it's on astroturf or grass
I think of those whose freedom was not free
And I say, "Take a knee, my ass!"


I'll stand up for the flag
Take off my hat for Old Glory
Thank God I live in the home of the brave
And the land of the free
I'll honor the ones who gave it all
So we're all free to go play ball
If only for their sake
I won't take a knee


From Valley Forge to Vietnam
9/11 to Afghanistan
That star-spangled banner does yet wave
I won't forget I owe a debt of gratitude
I never can repay
Arm and arm and side by side
American heroes fought and died
Is showing some respect too much to ask?
I speak for those whose freedom was not free
And I say, "Take a knee, my ass!"


I'll stand up for the flag
Take off my hat for Old Glory
Thank God I live in the home of the brave
And the land of the free
I'll honor the ones who gave it all
So we're all free to go play ball
If only for their sake
I won't take a knee
O say can you see?
If only for their sake
I won't take a knee

Tune: She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy

Hi ho Silver, AWAY!
After my show, thought I'd have a little fun
Hopped on a horse: Shorty sure could run
Well, I got a butt kickin, when the police finally caught me
("Give me back my horse!!!")
Not a moment too soon, Tim McGraw jumped in
Did his best Jackie Chan, caught a cop on the chin
Now I don't understand why they's arrestin' me

My cellmate thinks I'm sexy, I really turn him on
He's always staring at me, oh, when the guards are gone
I'm runnin out of cigarettes; he's askin me to dance
He says I'm lookin good in these orange pants
I really wish Tim McGraw was here to protect me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy

I'd give anything to be back on my bus
I'm hidin' in my bunk, but he's climbin' on up
Swears all he wants me to do is sing him one of my songs
Says he's got a dream: I'm afraid of what it is
You're never gonna see me on a horse after this
I only get one call. I hope that Faith is home

My cellmate thinks I'm sexy, he just won't leave me alone
He's blowin' kisses at me, and I'm a'duckin' em all
I hate to break it to him, I'm in no mood for romance
What part of no don't this fool understand?
I'm in big trouble if someone don't come and get me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy

Well one day behind bars is long enough
'Cos when I drop that show gold, man his eyes light up

My cellmate thinks I
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy, I really turn him on
My name is Kenny Chesney, this ain't where I belong
Me and Tim's in trouble, buddy, one thing is for sure,.
George Strait's gonna kick us off his George Strait tour
I'd call Tracy Lawrence but he's in the next cell beside me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy

I had him from hello...hello...hello
What's Up!!

Hey

The furnace burns in Steel Town
Big business came and tried to shut 'em down
But workers got together, and they bought that mill
They're making steel in Pittsburgh still

The family farm down in Indiana
The bank's foreclosing just because they can
And the farmer can't do nothing 'bout another drought
So John and Neil and Willie came and helped 'em out

'Cause these are the days of America
Brother to brother, hand in hand
Well, these are the days of America
Walking together through the promised land

The wheels in Detroit keep on turning
A blue collar lesson there for the learning
The throttle drives you anywhere, no matter how far
Just never give up on who you are

'Cause these are the days of America
Brother to brother, hand in hand
Well, these are the days of America
Walking together through the promised land

Right down the middle of America
Where her heart beats strong and true
Yeah, look up, just open your eyes
The flag still waves, and the eagle still flies

'Cause these are the days of America
Brother to brother, hand in hand
Well, these are the days of America
Walking together through the promised land

These are the days
These are the days of America
These are the days
These are the days of America


Ice meltin' down in another strong drink
Takin' my time, sipping through the pain alone, all alone
Gettin' on up and gettin' out of this place
Ain't worth the chance of me seeing your face again, not with him
It's kinda like ending up in hell with nobody to blame but yourself


I should've ran after you
I should've known everything I had to lose
Yeah, before you walked away and let me have my space
Before I ran you right in to the arms of someone new
I should've ran after you


If I'da spent another minute staring in your eyes
Maybe I'da seen how lonely I would be, now look at me
I should've been lovin' your tears away
Instead of standing there with nothing to say at all
Yeah, girl the second I saw tail lights...


I should've ran after you
I should've known everything I had to lose
Yeah, before you walked away and let me have my space
Before I ran you right in to the arms of someone new
I should've ran after you


Yeah, one second thought, I could have stopped it all
Letting you go was just the calm before the storm
I'd threw myself in to
I should've ran after you
Girl, I should've thought it through


I should've ran after you
And you're the hardest thing I ever had to lose
Yeah, before you walked away and let me have my space
Before I ran you right in to the arms of someone new
I should've ran after you


Yeah, I should've ran after you
Yeah, I should've
Now I've got ice meltin' down in another strong drink
Taking my time, sippin' through the pain

I'll be home for Christmas;
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas

If only in my dreams
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams




I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything


What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt


I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here


What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt


If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way


Steel drums still ringing in my head
Well I feel pain, So I'm not dead
From the looks of things, it looks like
It got a little crazy last night


Could I get your name again?
Some situation that we're in
Woke up by each others side
It got a little crazy last night


Last thing I remember
I told the bartender mix rum and whatever you have
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you so I know things can't be all that bad
But it's still a little hazy, it got a little crazy last night


Are these your shoes that I have on?
Is this your bed, is this your home?
All I know is, it's not mine
It got a little crazy last night


Last thing I remember
I told the bartender mix rum and whatever you have
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you so I know things can't be all that bad
But it's still a little hazy, it got a little crazy last night


I think I feel a fresh tattoo
What is it of, I wish I knew
It couldn't get more out of sight
It got a little crazy last night


Last thing I remember
I told the bartender mix rum and whatever you have
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you so I know things can't be all that bad
But it's still a little hazy, sounds a little shady, I think she might have paid me, it got a little crazy last night


Got a little crazy last night
Got a little crazy

In the midnight hour, I see her
Waving proudly through the night
The stars and stripes she bears
Are a glorious sight

She represents all the heroes
Who couldn't stand to see her fall
They represent this great nation
And remind us all

There is still the land of freedom
And the home for the brave
A nation under God
Where justice reigns

There's a country united
However different we may be
We can walk a little taller
When we see old glory

There is strength within her colors
And courage all can see
That brings hope and peace to some
And others to their knees

There is power in her presence
And a calm within her wave
And if you listen closely
You can hear her say

There is still the land of freedom
And the home for the brave
A nation under God
Where justice reigns

There's a country united
However different we may be
We can walk a little taller
When we see old glory

She's been tattered, she's been turned
Been abused and even burned
But she hasn't lost a thread of dignity

Because her strength can't be found
In her colors or her bounds
Her strength is found in you and me

So let us all remember
The sacrifices made
The battles we've won
And the prayers we've prayed

Let's make sure that our heroes
Didn't sacrifice in vain
Let us join together
And proudly proclaim

There is still the land of freedom
And the home for the brave
A nation under God
Where justice reigns

There's a country united
However different we may be
We can walk a little taller
When we see old glory

So let's walk a little taller
When we see old glory
Oh yeah, old glory, yeah

Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be


Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy


I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer


Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah


Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat


Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah


Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat


I ain't never had a problem with California
There's a lot of good women from Sacramento to Corona
But them Hollywood types
After a while wear on you

Strutting around in their size zeros
Skinny little girls no meat on their bones
Never even heard of George Jones


Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls
Ain't you glad there's still a few of us left
That know how to rock your world

Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken
And dirty dance to Merle
Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls


There ain't nothing wrong with plastic surgery
Well, Dolly Parton never looked so good to me
Everybody ought to be exactly who they want to be

But that Paris Hilton gets under my skin
With her big fake smile
And her painted-on tan
She'd never have a chance at a real man



Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls
Ain't you glad you glad there's still a few of us left
That know how to rock your world

Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken
And dirty dance to Merle
Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls

Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls


I was coming to the end of a long, long walk
When a man crawled out of a cardboard box
Under the E Street Bridge
Followed me on to it
I went out halfway across
With that homeless shadow tagging along
So I dug for some change
Wouldn't need it anyway
He took it lookin' just a bit ashamed
He said, You know, I haven't always been this way


I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that plane ride coming home from the war
That summer my son was born
And memories like a coat so warm
A cold wind can't get through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments


I stood there tryin' to find my nerve
Wondering if a single soul on Earth
Would care at all
Miss me when I'm gone
That old man just kept hanging around
Lookin' at me, lookin' down
I think he recognized
That look in my eyes
Standing with him there I felt ashamed
I said, You know, I haven't always been this way


I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that plane ride coming home from the war
That summer my son was born
And memories like a coat so warm
A cold wind can't get through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments


I know somewhere 'round a trashcan fire tonight
That old man tells his story one more time
He says


I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that cool night on the E. Street Bridge
When a young man almost ended it
I was right there, wasn't scared a bit
And I helped to pull him through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
Oh, lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments


I've had my moments
I've had my moments
I've had my moments


Oh hey, boy with your hat back...
Mmm, I kinda like that
If you wanna walk my way
Imma shoot you straight up
Show me what you're made of


I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby
Do you got what it takes?


If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it
If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy, love me like you mean it


Oh hey, I've had my share of losers, liars and users
Looking for a heart to break
So if you're like that
Well take a step back


I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby
Are you just crazy or crazy over me?


If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it
If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna  keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy, love me like you mean it
If you're gonna love me, love me
If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me, love me
If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy, love me like you mean it


Love me like you mean it
Love me like you mean it
If you're gonna love me, love me, love me
Love me like you mean it yeah

Baby blue staring in the window pane just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she’s got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress, now her heart’s a mess
Praying she will find a way to make it

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching, though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
‘Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Searching for a sign in the night even like a lonely string of lights
That’ll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road’s been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There’s more to this than just the breath you’re breathing

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching, though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
‘Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

You won’t forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath and fly

Keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching, though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
‘Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Fly

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you
All it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
I should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
And take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
And now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up this mess I made, no…
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
I should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
And take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
And now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I was probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Gives you all his hours
When he has the chance
Takes you to every party
Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man


If you save yourself for marriage you're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one


If you can't lose the weight then you're just fat
But if you lose too much then you're on crack
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So, you might as well just do whatever you want


So, make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points


If you don't go to church you'll go to Hell
If you're the first one on the front row you're a self-righteous son of a...
Can't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em
Just ’cause you can't beat 'em don't mean you should join 'em


So, make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points


Say what you think, love who you love
’Cause you just get so many trips around the sun
Yeah, you only...
Only live once


So, make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points


I was fifteen when my daddy's old man
Caught me half way through my first beer
He laughed so hard when my face turned green
He said “You come from a long line of sinners like me”
Now me and my brother go to see him some times
But he don't have much to say anymore
So we sit on his headstone with a fifth of Jack D
Here's to a long line of sinners like me


La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me


My mama had a soft spot for a hell raisin' boy
So she had two more just like him
It takes an angel to raise a family
That comes from a long line of sinners like me
Well now maybe who knows one day I'll settle down
Give my dad a grandson of his own
And when the doctor smacks him, he'll probably take a swing
Because he'll come from a long line of sinners like me


La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me


On the day I die
I know where I'm going to go
Me and Jesus got that part worked out
I'll wait at the gates til his face I see
And stand in a long line of sinners like me
I'll stand in a long line of sinners like me


La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
Here’s to a long line of sinners like me
I come from a long line of sinners like me

Bring it on to me

We're backwoods Dixie, flat woods pickin'
Shotgun wavin', long-neck drinkin'
Huntin' and a-fishin', workin' and a-wishin' for the weekend

We say: "Yes Ma'am, No Ma'am, Sir, can I lend a hand?"
Take a stand for somethin' we believe in
Love an' pray and do anythin' for a good friend

We like camp fires burnin', buttermilk churnin'
Old folks, dirt roads windin' and a-turnin'
To a muddy creek; jumpin' from a talltree into the deep end

That's a country thang
People who don't live it might just think we've gone insane
But those of us down home, we can stand right up and say:
It's a country thang

We like moonlight sippin', late skinny-dippin'
Flat rock skippin', catfish hittin'
Sittin' on a creek-bank, sun's up but we ain't leavin'

We like country twang, and good suthern rockin'
Fun in the sun on the bass boat dockin'
Home made wine an' a mess of fish frying an' then a hot pan

Got Gran'mas, gran'pas, newborn young'uns;
Double wide homes an' double first cousins
An old town square an' a county fair: it's a good plan

It's a country thang
People who don't live it mught just think we've gone insane
But those of us down home, we can stand right up and say:
It's a country thang

It's a country thang
People who don't live it mught just think we've gone insane
But those of us down home, we can stand right up and say:
It's a country thang
It's a country thang
It's a country thang

That's right!


I heard it on the street
That you were seeing someone
It knocked me off my feet
I guess I walked into that one

I haven’t even cried
Now you know that’s a lie
I’m tearin’ up inside
This ain’t easy
It’s killin’ me, I’m goin’ crazy


I think about you every single day
Every second, every minute
Every prayer I pray
To get you back in my arms

What I’d give to have you around
Every night I lie awake
‘Cause I can’t sleep
Midnight to morning feels like a damn week
I miss you so much I can barely breathe

You are my everything, everything
Everything
You are my everything, everything
Everything to me


It’s gonna take time
To finally see things clear
Even when you’re off my mind
You always reappear

I’m trying to make it through
But I really need you
What can I do to get you back
I’m on my knees, beggin’ please




I’m on my knees
I’m beggin’ please
Come back to me

You’re all I need
You’re everything, everything
Everything
I’m goin’ crazy



Oh (I’m on my knees, I’m beggin,’ please)
(Come back to me. You’re all I need)
Oh, you are my everything
(You’re everything, everything)
Everything
I’m going crazy

Everything
Everything
Everything to me

Well, he wanted someone firmer
And he wanted someone younger
And he always had a thing for blondes
As it happened
His new secretary happened to be all that rolled into one

And the woman who had lived with him
An angel who had given him the last twenty two years
Is now cryin' big Cadillac tears

Cadillac tears don't hurt so bad
Cadillac tears
She ain't so sad
Well, she might a lost her wedding ring
But she took him for everything
No, mama didn't do too bad
Aw, she's crying big Cadillac tears

Well, she's running through his money so fast it isn't funny
Aw, she's emptied every shop in town
Oh, she bought 'em Akin diamond rings
And lots of other shiny things to wear
When she goes steppin' out

And she's headed to her lawyers
'Cause this morning when he called her
He said, "Checks are pillin' up down here"
Aw, she's cryin' big Cadillac tears

Cadillac tears, don't hurt so bad
Cadillac tears
She ain't so sad
Well, she might a lost her wedding ring
But she took him for everything
No, mama didn't do too bad
Aw, she's crying big Cadillac tears

Hey man, she's crusin' down the street
With custom wheels and leather seats
You know, she gets a new one every year
Aw, she's crying big Cadillac tears

Mama is cryin' big Cadillac tears
Big old Cadillac tears

Clothes scattered across the bedroom floor
Soaking wet towel hanging on the door
Looks like a hurricane just came through
Her makeup covers up
Every inch of the counter top
She's slappin' on a little bit of strawberry lip gloss
She's ready to rock

She's my hot mess, in a sundress
Got my heart beating out of my chest
Country girl come to town looking like a rock star
She's got hazel eyes and a wild side
Lightin' up the room with her smokey little smile
Burnin' up and down, turning them heads
She's my little hot mess

When she gets to dancin' to the band
Them shoes gonna wind up in her hand
Barefoot and groovin' like nobody's watchin'
She gonna cut up and drink a little
Play them boys like a bluegrass fiddle
The rave of the party's at
Oh she's right there in the middle

She's my hot mess, in a sundress
Got my heart beating out of my chest
Country girl come to town looking like a rock star
She's got hazel eyes and a wild side
Lightin' up the room with her smokey little smile
Burnin' up and down, turning them heads
She's my little hot mess

Every guy in here tonight, wants to take her home
But in the morning she's gonna wake up, with my t-shirt on

She's my hot mess, in a sundress
Got my heart beating out of my chest
Country girl come to town looking like a rock star
She's got hazel eyes and a wild side
Lightin' up the room with her smokey little smile
Burnin' up and down, turning them heads
She's my little hot mess
She's my little hot mess
Yes, she is


I'm to the point where it don't add up
I can't say I've come this far with my guitar on pure dumb luck
That's not to say i know it all
Cause every time I get too high up on my horse I fall


Cause I've got
Something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings and
Something to keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need
Jesus and gravity


But I'm as bad as anyone
Taking all these blessings in my life for granted one by one
When I start to thinking it's all me
Well something comes along and knocks me right back on my knees
And I've got




He's my friend
He's my light
He's my wings
He's my ?




Jesus, I've got Jesus, I've got Jesus
He's my everything
He lifts me up
He gives me wings
He gives me hope
And He gives me strength
And that's all I'll ever need


As long as He keeps lifting me up
He is my life
He is my God
He is my wings
He is my flight
Lift me, I've got Jesus, I've got Jesus
And that's all I need

From across the room, I can feel this tension between us
It's always there, just outta sight
An' we both know, that love don't live here anymore
You don't have to say it, I can read between the lines

Who's gonna leave an' who's gonna stay
An' how long can this house an' two cars
An' one little girl stand in our way

How long can we keep holdin' on
To somethin' that's already gone?
Girl, life's too short to love like this:
Too tired to try an' too scared to quit
We took to heart the vows we made
But somehow lost the will:
Yeah, we said: "I do,"
But do we still?

Hangin' on the wall is an eight by ten reminder:
You in your gown, me in my rented tux
We had it all when all we had was each other
But now it's gone: that ol' picture gathers dust

How long can we keep holdin' on
To somethin' that's already gone?
Girl, life's too short to love like this:
Too tired to try an' too scared to quit
We took to heart the vows we made
But somehow lost the will:
Oh, we said: "I do,"
But do we still?

How long can we keep holdin' on
To somethin' that's already gone?
Girl, life's too short to love like this:
Too tired to try an' too scared to quit
We took to heart the vows we made
But somehow lost the will;
Oh, somehow lost all the will:
Oh, we said: "I do,"
But do we still?

(Do we still?)
(Do we still?)

She stands in the face of evil
And will not lose hope or faith
America, the land of freedom
Still the home of the brave
So raise the banner called Old Glory
Let us join our fellow man
History will write the story
America will always stand
Walking through the fires of danger
There are those who gave their lives
They're the world's greatest heroes
And we won't forget their sacrifice
So raise the banner called Old Glory
Let us join our fellow man
History will write the story
America will always stand
America is not divided
Our enemies they will be stopped
'Cause, we the people are united
And still, one nation under God
So raise the banner called Old Glory
Let us join our fellow man
History will write the story
America will always stand
History will write the story
America will always stand


Call me as soon as your plane gets in
I'll tell you where to take the cab
Can't talk now in the middle of this crowd
But baby, I miss you so bad
I got a bottle of wine
Some stolen time
Key to a room where you can be all mine


Till it feels like cheating
Till it feels that good
Nobody's leaving
So let's get it understood
Oh you could be a stranger
It's been that long
There's something 'bout the danger of feeling like we're doing something wrong
Let's make the love that we needed
Till it feels like cheating


Don't say a word when you walk in
We ain't got time for that
Kiss me hard like we're about to sin
And there ain't no going back
For a while we'll be free, just you and me
Making promises life won't let us keep


Till it feels like cheating
Till it feels that good
Nobody's leaving
So let's get it understood
Oh you could be a stranger
It's been that long
There's something 'bout the danger of feeling like we're doing something wrong
Let's make the love that we needed
Till it feels like cheating


Keeping the spark going is an everyday fight
So I sent the kids to your mama
And baby, we got all night


Till it feels like cheating
Till it feels that good
Nobody's leaving
So let's get it understood
You could be a stranger
It's been that long
There's something 'bout the danger of feeling like we're doing something wrong
Let's make the love that we needed
Till it feels like cheating
Oh yeah, baby
Let's make the love that we needed
Till it feels like cheating


You said you needed your space
I wasn't where you wanted to be
I didn't stand in your way
I only want you to be happy
And so how surprised am I to see you here tonight


Well, oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so


Sometimes in our lives
We get to where we wonder if
The long road that we're on
Is heading in the same direction
When it comes to you and me
We're right where I know we should be


Well, oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so


Sometimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love
And the slightest thing can grow so foolishly
Remind me, please


Oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
But I told you so
Should have known better
Than to leave me, baby
Should have known better
Than to leave me, darling

Sometimes in the morning
My coffee gets ice cold
And I'll burn up three cigarettes
Before I have my first smoke
Miss my exit on the way to work
Every now and then
I always blame it on the traffic when they ask me where I've been

And in a crowded elevator
I'll start hummin' that ol' song
There's no way of knowin' when that urge will come along
I've been stuck in some meeting
Looked down at my legal pad
I'd see hearts and flowers and butterflies
And I can't help but laugh

That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And those "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me

That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie

An sometimes in the evening
I hear barefeet in the hall
And I see a slender silhouette dance across the wall
Then I catch the sent of jasmine perfume in the wind
And I know it's her sweet memory coming back again

That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And thos "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me

That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy

But that's just Jessie
In a white cotton dress
That's just a wildfire that I ain't put out yet
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And those "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me

That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, Ill be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie

I been up all night long
Just waitin on the sun
I've given up, damn the dawn
It ain't never gonna come
Something's wrong
As long as your gone

I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I could go for days
If you ever needed
To see me down on my knees
Take a look at me
Baby I can't sleep

Remember when
You said we wouldn't last
I couldn't swallow my pride
Oh its sinkin in
Baby losing you has
Finally opened my eyes
I'm wide awake
As long as it takes

I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I could go for days
If you ever needed
To see me down on my knees
Take a look at me
Baby I can't sleep

I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I could go for days
If you ever needed
To see me down on my knees
Take a look at me
Baby I can't sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I could go for days
I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I can't sleep


If your dream house
Is a double-wide trailer sitting back in the holler
On a country road
Then baby, that's where we'll go
If you don't wanna settle down
We can bounce around from town to town
And that's fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze


I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you


I'll bet there's a two lane
Running right through the middle
Of a wide open desert to a ghost town
If you wanna just hide out
We could send a postcard back
From a mountain top out in Idaho
Maybe get snowed in
Anytime baby you say when


I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you


I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you


Girl, I'll swear
Just say the word
I'll take you there
Aww anywhere, anywhere with you
Yeah I'll go anywhere with you


Well he came from Northern Ireland
Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come


There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the river


Well the redhead's son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me


There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the river


I know every single fencepost
Every rock that goes around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down


The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turned to blood


I've been sitting here all morning
I was sitting here all night
There's a bible in my left hand
And a pistol in my right


I told myself getting out
That's what this is all about
Sun goes up, sun goes down
You only get one go around
Then I left this town


Then I let that road carry me
As far as it could carry me
Stood on a mountain free
Found a place where I could breathe in and out
And thought about things that I can't live without


I keep coming back time after time
No matter where I'm at, I can't pretend
I've found something better than where I've been
'Cause where I'm from is who I am
And no matter how far that I run
Yeah, I keep coming back


They say the more people change
The more that they stay the same
So I just stopped everything
Thought about all the things weighing me down


Then I threw out old boxes, emptied my pockets
Of regrets and love letters, pictures and lockets
And all I have now is the truth that I've found
Life has a way of just turning around
And around, and around


I keep coming back time after time
No matter where I'm at, I can't pretend
I've found something better than where I've been
'Cause where I'm from is who I am
And no matter how far that I run
Yeah, I keep coming back


To the town on the hill
So peaceful and still
And my memories are at


Yeah, I keep coming back time after time
No matter where I'm at, I can't pretend
I've found something better than where I've been
'Cause where I'm from is who I am
And no matter how far that I run
No matter how far, no matter how far that I run
I keep coming back, I keep coming back
I keep coming back, ooh


It was a cold and dark December night
But a star still lit the sky
Away in a manger you heard a baby cry
It was the cry of the Son of God
A little baby boy
Born in that manger to bring the world joy


So hush up little baby
You know not what you'll do
You'll bring the world peace and love
And teach them while you do
You have nothing to fear because you know
God is with you all the way
That little important baby
Born on Christmas day


Many people soon gathered round that tiny run down barn
They knew not of what they saw
Then came three all dressed in fancy robes, silks and furs
This was the first indication of the importance of his birth




We expected a soldier to save us from our plight
All dressed in shiny armor, ready for a fight
But instead he sent a little baby boy
All filled with love happiness
To bring the world joy




All the things I felt and never shared
All the times she was lonely with me there
Tears I wouldn't let fall from my eyes, and how I let her go without a fight


The reasons I`m alone I know by heart, but I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life. If love ever gives me another try


There is no changing things that we regret
The best that we can hope for is one more chance
If the hands of time could just move in reverse, I wouldn't make the same mistake again with her


The reasons I`m alone I know by heart, but I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life. If love ever gives me another try
The reasons I`m alone I know by heart, but I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life. If love ever gives me another try



Oh if love ever gives me another try


Wait baby, listen you got me twistin' watching you sippin' on that drink
I saw you smile back and I didn't miss that "it's on a little later on" wink
And your song comes on, you dance along
I can't believe how bad you got me like


Dayum, baby dayum, baby dayum
I love standing here watching you breakin' it down, baby down, baby down
You keep pulling me in when you spinnin' around, baby 'round, baby 'round
I can see you'll probably be keepin' me up all night (All I wanna do Is take it slow)
Yeah, but that's alright (So take me anywhere you wanna go)
'Cause girl you got me like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum
Yeah you got me like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum


Baby you're rockin', you got me locked in
I know that you're dancing just for me
If you wanna go then, we'll get to rollin'
'Cause I'd love to sweep you off your feet


Like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum
I love standing here watching you breakin' it down, baby down, baby down
You keep pulling me in when you spinnin' around baby, 'round, baby 'round
I can see you'll probably be keepin' me up all night (All I wanna do Is take it slow)
Yeah, but that's alright (So take me anywhere you wanna go)
'Cause girl you got me like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum
Yeah you got me like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum


Yeah, if you wanna take me home and turn it on
You know I'm there cause girl I swear

Dayum, baby dayum, baby dayum
Mmm gon' let your long hair down, baby down, baby down
We'll be loving til the sun comes back around, baby 'round, baby 'round
I can see you'll probably be keepin' me up all night (All I wanna do Is take it slow)
Yeah, but that's alright (So take me anywhere you wanna go)
'Cause girl you got me like dayum, baby dayum, baby dayum
Yeah you got me like dayum, baby dayum, baby dayum


Girl you got me like dayum baby, I ain't talkin' 'bout call me maybe
I'm fallin' talkin' crazy, but I gotta call a spade what a spade is
Babygirl now you my queen, I got a pocket full of aces
I'm a get you hot, I'm a fly you to your favorite places
Chasin' your dreams, so real that you can almost taste it
I'm a take you back to the basics, we gon' cover all of the bases
And I'm a lay you down and take my time 'til you can hardly take it

Dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum


Once, in a lifetime
You'll open up your heart
Maybe once, in your lifetime
You'll swear to never be apart


You think your love's on solid ground
Then out of the blue, it all comes tumblin' down


Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody help me understand


And my picture, in your locket
What will you do with it now
All our friends, and all our memories
Tell me how we sort them out


What's yours is yours, what's mine is mine
Is that all that's left, after all this time


Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody...


Help me understand
Why I'm not part of our plan
And you don't need me anymore
Help me understand
Why I still want to be where you are
Even though I know in my hear
You don't love me anymore


Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me
Somebody help me understand

A 1986 Harley
Blowin' smoke and suckin' oil
My daddy said, "Buy it and you're crazy, boy"
Can't tell me nothin'

It took two months to fix it up
And one day to lay her down
I got a little hitch in my get-along now
Can't tell me nothin'

Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
Can't tell me nothin'

Hometown homecoming sweetheart
Nobody thought I had a prayer
Her mama said, "Boy, don't you come around here"
Can't tell me nothin'

They say be careful what you wish for
I wanted to be her man
Now two babies and a trailer later, here I am
Can't tell me nothin'

Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
Can't tell me nothin'

They say that drinkin'll kill you
The same thing for rollin' smoke
That's two of the three things I like most
Can't tell me nothin'

I know what the Good Book preaches
But I know how I am
I sure hope somebody up there understands
Can't tell me nothin'
Can't tell me nothin


I know you see me
Like some wide eyed dreamer
That just rolled in off a dusty mid west bus
Yeah, on the outside I look fragile
But on the inside is something you can't crush


'Cause I'm country strong
Hard to break
Like the ground I grew up on
You may fool me
And I'll fall
But I won't stay down long
Cause I'm country strong


I have weathered
Colder winters; Longer summers
Without a drop of rain
Push me in a corner
And I'll come out fighting
I may lose but I 'll always keep my faith


'Cause I'm country strong
Hard to break
Like the ground I grew up on
You may fool me
And I'll fall
But I won't stay down long
'Cause I'm country strong




Cause I'm country strong
Hard to break
Like the ground I grew up on
You may fool me
And I'll fall
But I won't stay down long
Cause I'm country strong
Hard to break
Like the ground I grew up on
You may fool me
And I'll fall
But I won't stay down long
Cause I'm country strong, Yeah!
I'm country strong
Yeah, I'm country strong
I'm country strong
I'm country strong
I'm country strong


She got that 'hey y'all' little southern draw that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring


Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time


She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does


She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping


I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time


She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life


Oh, she does
Back to life

She thinks I walk on water
She thinks I hung the moon
She tells me every morning
"They just don't make men like you"

She thinks I've got it together
She swears I'm as tough as nails
But I don't have the heart to tell her
She don't know me that well

She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss, without her touch
Without her faithful, loving arms
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
She's my world, she's my everything
And she thinks she needs me

Sometimes she cries on my shoulder
When she's lying next to me
But she don't know that when I hold her
That she's really holding me, holding me

She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss, without her touch
Without her faithful, loving arms
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
She's my world, she's my everything
And she thinks she needs me

Yeah, and the funny thing is
She thinks she's the lucky one

She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss, without her touch
Without her faithful, loving arms
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
She's my world, she's my everything
And she thinks she needs me

She thinks I walk on water
She thinks I hung the moon


I had a couple beers with one of my friends
​Told him just how our story ends
​Did all I could to try to make it work
​But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt


​I've been at the house, climbin' them walls
​Checkin' that calendar, x'in days off
​Hit another bar, call another friend
​Throw a few down, tell the story again
​

​Hey, hey, what can I say?
​I can just lie and say it's all okay
​Oh, oh, what can I do?
​Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
​But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​

I'm finally gettin' out back into the world
​Life is good, I met me a girl
​She got a beautiful heart, eyes are blue
​I don't hardly ever think about you
​

​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to


​Sometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine
​Sometimes I break down and cry
​

​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
It don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to

Sunset by the lake
It looked just like a dream
My world stopped on a dime
When she hopped out of that jeep
All my Buddy said "Boy don't waste your time"
She's out of your league but I was out of my mind


That girl bare foot in a sun dress
Top down hair in a wild mess
Sweet smile singing to the summer of 69
That girl just a little crazy
Green eyed sweet child of Dixie
Everything I ever hoped I'd find in
That girl

They say some people never change
Girl I know its true
Cause you still turn me on
As much as you used to
And every time we touch
I'm still 17
And in my arms you'll always be



Top down
Sweet smile singing to that summer of 69


Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won’t cry
'Cause I know I’ll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow


I’ll see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again


I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away
Where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow


I’ll see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again


Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on 'cause I know
I’ll see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah, yeah


I’ll see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again


'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone

I wrote a letter to Santa last night
Told him what I want to make my Christmas right
If I don't get it, I'm gonna be blue
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you

I don't want no tinker toys
Don't wanna waste my time drinkin' with the boys
There's only one thing that I wanna do
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you

I want a rockin' little Christmas
Rockin' little Christmas
If I get my wishes
It's gonna be delicious
A stockin' full of love for two

Well, I've been a good boy all year
I deserve a little Christmas cheer
I want your arms around me the whole night through
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you

Tell me baby what's it gonna be
Where you gonna spend your Christmas Eve
Will I be merry or will I be blue
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you

I am home now
Home now
I've been waiting for forever to find you
To find you ( To Find You)
I'm not alone now
Alone now
'Cause you've taken in my heart from the cold
All I know is everytime I look into your eyes
I'm home
I know

You're where I belong
I belong with you
Your where I belong
And I know its the truth
You're a part of my heart
There's nothing I can do
Oh, You're the one who keeps me warm
My baby, You're where I belong

You're my first taste
My first taste
Of the sweetest feeling I've ever known
That I've known
You're my safe place
Safe place
From a world that can be so cruel and cold
You're my harbor
You're my shelter
You're that welcome smile
That lets me know I'm home

You're where I belong
I belong with you
You're where I belong
And I know its the truth
You're part of my heart
There's nothing I can do
Oh, You're the one that keeps me warm
My baby, You're where I belong
You're the one I come to
To keep me from the cold

You're where I belong
I belong with you

Youre where I Belong and I know its the truth
Youre Part of My Heart
Theres Nothin' I can do
Ooh youre the one that keeps me warm
My Baby youre where I belong

Youre where I Belong
You're my only cure

I am home now
Home now

The house was like a tomb
I was hiding in my room
As my brother made his way on down the hall

I didn't want to say goodbye
And I was trying to deny there was a war
And that he got the call

I watched him from my window
Walking down the drive
Then I ran down the stairway
Through the front door and I cried

You come back you hear?
And I let him see my tears
I said I'll give you my rookie of DiMaggio
I'll do anything you want
Clean your room, or wash your car
I'll do anything so long as you don't go
But he said, this is what brothers are for

Well I have my heroes
But the one I love the most
Taught me how to hunt and swing a bat
And I wrote him every night
I said I miss our pillow fights
But lately I just wonder where you're at

Sometimes freedom makes it hard to live
When it takes things from you that you don't want to give

I said you come back you hear?
I miss you being near
We'll laugh and fish down in the maple grove

I'll do anything you want
There must be someone I can call
And just maybe they would let you come back home
But he wrote, this is what brothers are for

I may never have to face the anger of those guns
Or lie cold and wounded in my blood
Or know the sacrifice and what it must of cost
For him to love me that much

Well, it had been two years
And I held back my tears
When I saw him in that wheel chair on the shore

And as I ran and held him tight
That's when he looked me in the eye
And said I'm sorry that you have to push me home
But I said, this is what brothers are for


I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...


She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town


For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines are closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

When you break up in a small town


Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, "... that guy!" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...

Seven years old, everything was right
Table for four on a Friday night
Didn't see any signs of a dead end road
By the time I was ten, everything was changing
Fell asleep every night prayin'
Didn't know which way to go
Mama did her best to hide her anger
And I did my best to try and save her


I was a little too young and a little too dumb
To ever think the day would come
When dad would drive away
And take his love with him
So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now – innocent and seven
I wish I had never turned 11


We moved into a smaller house
How mama did it oh I don’t know how
Never went to bed without eating
At 13 I finally realized
What it means to get on with your life
But daddy sure did and he made it look easy
Mama did her best to hide the struggle
And I did my best to stay out of trouble


I was a little too young and a little too dumb
To ever think the day would come
When dad would drive away
And take his love with him
So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now – innocent and seven
I wish I had never turned 11


I wish that I could turn back time
And tell myself it’ll be alright
You’re never gonna lose a lot in your eyes


I was a little too young and a little too dumb
To ever think the day would come
So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now – innocent and seven
I wish I had never turned 11
I wish I had never turned 11


I wish I had never turned 11

I am insensitive I have a tendency to pay more attention to the things that
I need
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust, sometimes I dunno
Why you're staying with me?

I'm hard to love, hard to love, I don't make it easy, I couldn't do it if I
Stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, you say that you need me, I don't deserve
It but I love that you love me. goood

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning full of grace and full of Jesus I wish that I
Could be more like you

I'm hard to love, hard to love, I don't make it easy, I couldn't do it if I
Stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, you say that you need me, I don't deserve
It but I love that you love me. Goood
Love me good

Girl you've given me a million second chances and I don't ever wanna take
You for granted, I'm just a man, I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love, oh I don't make it easy and I couldn't do it if
I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me, I don't
Deserve it but I love that you love me. good. (x2)

You love me good


Hey, we're all in the same boat
Life can really suck sometimes
But hey, can't live in a shadow
So here's a little piece of advice


Start by kicking off your shoes, leave 'em right by the door
Then you call a couple friends and you call a few more
Put a drink into your glass that will make you let go
Then you find something smooth on the radio


That makes you wanna sway to the left and sway to the right
Get lost in a groove that'll make you lose your mind
Put a smile on your face, sends you right into a daze
No there ain't nothin' wrong when a song comes on
That makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh


Hey, world's kinda messed up
We got no time for sittin' around
Waitin' for it to lit up
Let's break some rules and figure it out


Start by kicking off your shoes, leave 'em right by the door
Then you call a couple friends and you call a few more
Put a drink into your glass that will make you let go
Then you find something smooth on the radio


That makes you wanna sway to the left and sway to the right
Get lost in a groove that'll make you lose your mind
Put a smile on your face, sends you right into a daze
No there ain't nothin' wrong when a song comes on
That makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh
That makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh


Start by kicking off your shoes
And you find something smooth


Something that makes you wanna sway to the left and sway to the right
Get lost in a groove that'll make you lose your mind

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
And here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with that ol' snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking, walking


If I ever write
The story of my life
Don't be surprised
If you're where it begins
Girl, I'd have to dedicate
Every line on every page
To the memories we made
While you loved me


I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me
But I lived, oh how I lived
While you loved me


I'd start with chapter one
Love innocent and young
As a morning sun, on a new day
Even though I know the end
Well I'd do it all again
Cause I got a lifetime in
While you loved me







Suitcase packed with all his things
Car pulls up
The doorbell rings
He don't wanna go
He thought he'd found his home

But with circumstances he can't change
Waves goodbye as they pull away
From the life he's known
For the last seven months or so
She said

We found a man who looks like you
Who cried and said he never knew
About the boy in pictures that we showed him

A rambler in his younger days
He knew he made a few mistakes
But he swore he would have been there
Had he known it
Son, we think we found your dad in Oklahoma

A million thoughts race through his mind
What's his name?
What's he like?
And will he be
Anything like the man in his dreams?

She could see the questions in his eyes
Whispered
Don't be scared, my child
I will let you know what we know about

The man we found
He looks like you
Who cried and said he never knew
About the boy in pictures that we showed him

A rambler in his younger days
He knew he made a few mistakes
But he swore he would have been there
Had he known it
You always said this was something that you wanted
Son it's time to meet your dad in Oklahoma

One last turn
He held his breath
Till they reached the fifth house on the left
And all at once
The tears came rolling in

And as they pulled in to the drive
The man was waiting there outside
Wiped the worry from his eyes
Smiled and took his hand
And he said

I'm the man who looks like you
Who cried because I never knew
About the boy in pictures that they showed me

A rambler in my younger days
I know I made a few mistakes
But I swear I would have been there
Had I known it
Never again will you ever be alone
Son, welcome to your home
In Oklahoma


Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats


Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can


The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets


Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can


We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile mmm
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile


Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can


I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Got braids in her hair

Fat cats just getting fatter
Linin their pockets
What does it matter?
All I want is an honest wage
A piece of ground where my kids are safe
80 bucks to fill my truck
Old man tellin' me times are tough
Stickin' it to the middle class
Well, they can kiss my price of gas
It's time to speak my mind

Hey-yea this is my life
Woa-woa this is my life
Hey-yea this is my life
Woa-woa
Yeah, and I want it back

Republican or democrat
Well, I don't give a damn about that
I want a chance to do my job
Pledge allegiance to my god
Talking heads tryin to buy my vote
I'm just tryin pay my note
I'm a husband, tryin to be a father
Raise my son, and raise my daughter
Can you hear me?

Hey-yea this is my life
Woa-woa this is my life
Hey-yea this is my life
Woa-Woa
Yeah, and I want it back

Well I'm just standin on the edge of the brink
I will not go quietly
I'll tell you what I think

It's time to speak my peace
Squeaky wheel always get the grease
One single voice dont matter
But everybody screamin up the ladder
Gonna get the attention of the man on top
Make his ladder shake and rock
And it might just
Come a' tumblin down
Spread all that wealth around
That's what I'm talkin' about

Hey-yea this is my life
Woa-woa this is my life
Hey-yea this is my life
Woa-woa
Yeah, this is my life


Same Saturday night
Same ol' crowd
Draggin' Main to the Safeway
Then we turn back around

'Til curfew then head
Down to the river's edge and get drunk
Ain't nothing new what else
You gonna do out in Podunk

Well
I knew this six-string was my ticket out
No flashing red light was gonna slow me down

18 years old
Everything that I owned in the back of that truck
I put a dip in my mouth
And I headed straight out outta Podunk


Goodbye
Daddy looked me in the eye, said
"Go where you gotta go
But don't forget to call home."

And Momma cried
"Keep Jesus in your life"
And I hugged her one last time

And then I headed down the road
In a dusty cloud of smoke
Out of Podunk


A lot of years gone
By showing on my face
Nothing in this life that time hasn't changed
I chased a lot of dreams
And some of them came true

Ain't it funny how the very place
I ran from is the place
I'm runnin' to

Another Saturday night
Singing to the same ol' crowd
Still playing this six-string
But things are different now

I met one of those girls
Turn your whole world around girls
And wouldn't you know it
We got our eyes on a house 'bout a hundred miles south
Out in Podunk


Goodbye
Her daddy looked me in the eye
And said, "Go where you gotta go, son
But don't forget to call home."

And her momma cried, said
"Keep Jesus in your life"
And we hugged her one last time

Then we headed down the road
To start a family of our own
Out in Podunk



I used to think I was the only one
Who never knew what it was like to fall
But you came along changed all the rules that day
An' just for a moment I had it all
You are the dream I live with, you are the wish I'd made:
The name I always whisper in every prayer I pray
Now that you left me; while you forget me
I'll hold you in my dreams

Now I go on here in my lonely world
But there's still a bridge I cannot cross
I can't let go so please forgive me, girl
'Cause God only knows all that I've lost

You are the dream I live with, you are the wish I'd made:
The name I always whisper in every prayer I pray
Now that you left me; while you forget me

You are the dream I live with, you are the wish I'd made:
The name I always whisper in every prayer I pray
Now that you left me; while you forget me
I'll hold you, I'll hold you, in my dreams


Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight


So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me


Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more


So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me


Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free


So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey hey mama rock me
Mama rock me
Mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
You can rock me
Rock me


Please take down the mistletoe
Because I don't want to think about that right now
Because everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you are well
Well I am doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell


I know this should not be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine


I have been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold


But for me it is just a lonely time
Because there were Christmases when you were mine


Merry Christmas everybody
That will have to be something I just say this year
I will bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands


I know this should not be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I did not wonder how you are tonight
Because there were Christmases when you were mine


You were mine


Way beyond the city lights
Lies a cowboys paradise
Honeysuckle on the vine
Growing up on Southern time

Love to dance and we love to flirt
Ain’t afraid of a little dirt
We ain’t late for Sunday church
Mama raised us not to curse

Our shorts' a little shorter
'Cause the sun’s a little hotter
Sipping lemonade
While we’re playin’ in the water


Whoa, whoa, whoa
An’t nothing sweeter than us Georgia Peaches
Whoa, whoa, whoa
There’s a reason why the boys pick the Georgia Peaches


We grow where the grass is green
We got home grown in our jeans
We love country everything
From Alan Jackson to Aldean


Whoa, our drawl will drive you crazy
When we wink and call you baby
You don’t stand a chance once you’ve seen a southern lady

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Ain’t nothing sweeter than us Georgia Peaches
Whoa, whoa, whoa
There’s a reason why the boys pick the Georgia Peaches


Oh, ain’t nothing sweeter

It don’t matter where you’re from
Come on in and have some fun
We’re gonna treat you
Like you’re one of us, yeah


Whoa, whoa, whoa
Ain’t nothing sweeter than Georgia Peaches
Whoa, whoa, whoa
There’s a reason why the boys pick...

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Ain't nothing sweeter than the Georgia Peaches
Whoa, whoa, whoa
There's a reason why the boys pick the Georgia Peaches

Ain't nothing sweeter than Georgia Peaches

Traffic jams, commuter lines
Monthly quotas, the daily grind
In a hurry and out of time
The pressure's on
They're pushing and shoving
They're living on the edge


Meanwhile, back at the ranch
Sitting on the front porch
Swinging with Blanche
World's running from an avalanche
Meanwhile, back at the ranch
The big computer's on the blink
Y2K, what a stink
They bring the city to the brink
But not out here
The only thing that we got on line
Is the fish we caught for suppertime
Well, let me tell you, peace of mind
Is the last frontier
They're pushing and shoving
They're living on the edge


Out there crawling
Like ants upon the ground
Oh, go home
Hear them calling
But the sky is falling
Down, down, down, down, down
Meanwhile, back at the ranch
Sitting on my front porch
Swinging with Blanche
World's running from an avalanche


Call me the biggest the fool the world's seen yet
I've been goo-goo gaga since the day we met
I admit that I've gone insane
I go all to pieces when I hear your name
Light in the head weak in the knees
Girl you got me begging baby please please please


Crazy bout you baby what can I do
Crazy bout you baby I'm in love with you
Everything about you makes my heart go boom
Crazy bout you baby


Girl I get the shivers everytime we touch
This ain't your ordinary schoolboy crush
Spend all day dreaming how it's gonna be
When the sun goes down and you're next to me
Holding you close feels so right
Kissing and a hugging and a loving all night



[Break
Crazy bout you baby crazy bout you baby




Spend all day dreaming how it's gonna be
When the sun goes down and you're next to me
Holding you close feels so right
Kissing and a hugging and a loving all night




Crazy bout you baby crazy bout you baby
Crazy bout you baby crazy bout you baby
Crazy bout you baby crazy bout you baby


Dancin' when the stars go blue
Dancin' when the evening fell
Dancin' in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown


Dancin' out on 7th street
Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' with the marionette
Are you happy now?


Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue


Laughin' with your pretty mouth
Laughin' with your broken eyes
Laughin' with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby


Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue


Hum hum hum

I'm tired sleeping on us
I'm over dodging this crush
I'm sick of waiting 10 minutes just text you back
So you don't get to thinking that I'm too attached
I'm more than benefit friends
I'm more than just a weekend binge
I want you to be my hottie riding shotty
I don't want nobody's body that your body babe
All I'm trying to say is


There's a difference between miss you and I miss your face
There's a difference in what's going on and baby how was your day
Yeah there's a hell of difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning to
There's a difference in love ya and I love you
And I Wanna be the difference
Yeah I do


I Wanna be the difference between hey what's up and we gonna do tonight
Between year she's cool we hang out sometimes and that girl right there she's mine
Between leading you on and holding your hand
Sitting it out and girl let's dance
Between playing it safe and taking a chance
Yeah bumping the brakes or hitting the gas


There's a difference between miss you and I miss your face
There's a difference in what's going on and baby how was your day
Yeah there's a hell of difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning to
There's a difference in love ya and I love you
And I Wanna be the difference


Close the distance
And be the puzzle piece you dint even know you was missing babe
Ohh I wanna be the difference
Yea I do


There's a difference between miss you and I miss your face
There's a difference in what's going on and baby how was your day
Yeah there's a hell of difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning to
There's a difference in love ya and I love you
And I Wanna be the difference

I Wanna be the difference

I Wanna be the difference


Put my Chevy in the ditch, couple grand to get it fixed
Bank account runnin' dry, boss ain't got no overtime
Friday rolls around, gotta get this party to town
Got nothing to drive, but just outside I hear my ride


Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky
It's gonna get funky, funky
Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky
It's gonna get funky, funky


George Jones took a John Deere tractor, hope my donkey gets there faster
When I pull up in no pickup truck, jocks break out in laughter
But the ladies think it's cool, I kick it with a mule
I fill their glass, they tip them back
They dig the way I ride that ass and I do, you would if you could, too
They all walk funny when they're done, riding you know who


Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky
It's gonna get funky, funky
(Donkey bray)
Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky

All the ladies like to ride, oh, the ladies like to ride
Oh, the ladies like to ride, the ladies like my D-O-N-K-E-Y


Well, they say that's it last call, no, I don't sweat it, y'all
Got a bottle in the saddle, a six pack in the stall
So, baby, what you say we giddy up to my place
We hit the barn, ain't no harm rolling in the hay, hey


Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky
It's gonna get funky, funky
(Donkey bray)
Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky

Oh son


Around these parts, ain't much to do
Except work like a dog until Friday
Punch that clock, cash that check
Raise a little hell 'til Sunday (it's about that time)
About that time
There's a party back in the woods tonight
Heard it through the redneck grapevine
Got a keg of beer and a bunch of girls
Sure enough going to be a good time


It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown


Oh, we about to throwdown, son
Now we got a field full of daisy dukes
Round here we know how to grow them
Rocking little body and long tan legs
Sure ain't scared to show 'em, now
Show a little something, girl
Somebody said them city boys
Riding around looking for some trouble
If they bring it across that county line
You know there's gonna be a rumble


It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown


It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown
It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown
It's a small town throwdown


That's country

Well, lately I been noticin' a gradual escalation
In your inability to handle your libation
Go zero to sixty
When you get on the whiskey

Well, used to be a glass of wine an' you'd be fine all evenin'
Now I'm the one who says: "We're done," an' tells us when we're leavin'
Well, I miss the way that it was
Can't even catch a good buzz

'Cause I keep worryin' about who's drivin' home
Who's got the keys, who's got the 'phone
Who'll pay the bill, call a cab
I don't mean to make you mad
But I don't want that responsibility
An' I can't be with a woman, baby, who gets drunker than me

Well, I never thought it'd come to this when I said: "Have another."
'Cause, baby, you turned into me, an' I became my mother
Well, here's what I'm thinkin':
You're interferin' with my drinkin'

I think I have an answer to our present situation
'Cause you an' me out on the town's got built in limitations
So let me make this clear:
Hey I'm the one who's drinkin' here

'Cause I ain't worryin' about who's drivin' home
Who's got the keys, who's got the 'phone
Who'll pay the bill, call a cab
I don't mean to make you mad
But I don't want that responsibility
An' I can't be with a woman, baby, who gets drunker than me

I ain't tryin' to ruin your good time
But I damn sure ain't lettin' yours ruin mine
You ain't gonna ruin my good time, baby

I keep worryin' about who's drivin' home
Who's got the keys, who's got the 'phone
Who'll pay the bill, call a cab
I don't mean to make you mad
But I don't want that responsibility
An' I can't be with a woman, baby, who gets drunker than me
No, I can't be with a woman, baby, who gets drunker than me, yeah


Horses are running wide open I just got to ride
To those honky-tonk bars that stay open way past closing time
Songs 'bout free thinking and drinking sure light my fire
That flame leaves a scar on my heart like an old branding iron


She said rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider


Yesterday's nothing but dust I brush off my boots
While I'm wearing out roads don't you know that I'm sure missing you
If I leave you'll be wondering when I'll be back again
Between Texas and ranchers and old friends where do you fit in


She said rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider


Come on


Hey rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider


Woman come lay down beside me and be my shotgun rider


You wish on 'em, party underneath 'em
Way out there where it's easy to see 'em, stars
Yeah, if they line up, tonight you're gonna
Thank your lucky ones for shining down on you, stars


You stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang along with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars


You stare at 'em, swear if you could reach 'em
You'd give her one 'cause she's got you seeing the stars
Since that night she stole your heart


You stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang along with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars


She fell from 'em so you point your prayers at 'em
Cause she's got you feeling about as high as 'em


Since you stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang along with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars
Stars


It was about five until five on Friday
We were all getting ready to go
And the boss man started screaming
And his veins began to show
He said you and you come with me
Cause you're going to have to stay
My heart was thumping I was jumping
I had to get away


Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance


Well I was talking with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
He asked the loaded question
It seems unreal to me that
He said how do you feel about me
My mind was racing I was pacing
But the words just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing
Left to do I feel it coming on


Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance


You got to loosen up those chains and dance
Come on and loosen up those chains and dance

Yeah yeah
I had a six pack of beer in the bushes
The weekend I turned 18
I snuck out the back while my mom and dad
Watched Johnny Carson on TV

Well I picked her up at the end of the road
A red bandanna in her hair
I turned the radio up in that old Datsun truck
And drove off to God knows where

'Cause those were the days of thunder
And that was a magic summer
Young, dumb, and full of wonder
Thinkin' it would last forever

Love struck like a bolt of lightning
So strong and so exciting
Rainy nights I still remember
Those days of thunder

Over 90 miles an hour down a two lane road
With just one hand on the wheel
The other one wrapped around her body
And I found out how freedom feels

'Cause those were the days of thunder
And that was a magic summer
Young, dumb, and full of wonder
Thinkin' it would last forever

Love struck like a bolt of lightning
So strong and so exciting
Rainy nights I still remember
Those days of thunder

We were movin' so fast
Left foot on the gas
And we never looked back

'Cause those were the days of thunder
And that was a magic summer
Young, dumb, and full of wonder
Thinkin' it would last forever

Love struck like a bolt of lightning
So strong and so exciting
Rainy nights I still remember
Those days of thunder
Those days of thunder

Ever one runaway
Ever one to leave
Never one to hang around
Never one to grieve
If love turned into labor
I would just resign
Working through the hard times never crossed my mind
And I'm guity of entering and breaking hearts so dear
Guilty of unlawful flight and failing to appear
I've commited all the crimes of love - every felony
Now, I have but once defense - to plead insanity

Where can I surrender?
I'm tired of being free
I want love to come and make a prisioner out of me
I'm a big offender, Oh, love come capture me
Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key

Events have come full circle now
I spend my nights alone
Where love was once so full and free
Love had up and gone
If the Good Lord should see fit to bring
Sweet love my way again
I'll die before I run away
And be the fool I've been

Where can I surrender?
I'm tired of being free
I want love to come and make a prisioner out of me
I'm a big offender, Oh, love come capture me
Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key
Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key


There's a slow moon rising
It's shining on your skin
The way your body moves me
I know there's no holding back
No holding back


I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this


I can feel passion flowing
As you fall into my arms
The secret way you touch me
Tells me there's no holding back
No holding back



Now and then I confess you cross my mind
Now and then I guess I have a little too much time
I've changed my way of thinking
I've tried hard to separate what came too soon
From what came too late

I don't think about me in terms of you
I don't think about you in terms of us
I don't think about us in terms of love
I don't think about then in terms of now
I found a way to start again somehow
I don't think about what we thought it was
Oh, in terms of love
Oh, in terms of love

I'm countin' on heaven to understand
I didn't mean to go and mess up all the plans
Sometimes you know where you should go
Before you know the way
I'll bother with tomorrow
Once I made it through today

I don't think about me in terms of you
I don't think about you in terms of us
I don't think about us in terms of love
I don't think about then in terms of now
I found a way to start again somehow
I don't think about what we thought it was
Oh, in terms of love
Mmmm, hummm, yeah

I don't think about black in terms of grey
Or revelations in the light of day
I don't think about cold in terms of ice
Or second chances happenin' twice

I don't think about me in terms of you
I don't think about you in terms of us
I don't think about us in terms of love
I don't think about then in terms of now
I found a way to start again somehow
I don't think about what we thought it was
Oh, in terms of love

(I don't think about me in terms of you)
(I don't think about you in terms of us)
In terms of love

(I don't think about then in terms of now)
(I found a way to start again somehow)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't think about us in terms of love

Crank it

Where she grew up, there ain't no roads
Out in the sticks where the ginseng grows
She'd float down the river to get to school
Then her daddy'd come get her on an old pack mule
She run back and forth from shed to shack
Checkin' on the moonshine brewin' out back
If you don't get the picture by now
Then wait a minute

Chorus:
She got a bible; she's born again
She got a shotgun; she ain't afraid of sin
She got rebel-rousin', rowdy friends singin', whoa whoa whoa
She got a Trans Am, with a trailer hitch
She got horses, cows and Dixie Chicks
Goes honky-tonkin' just for kicks
If that ain't country
I don't know what is

She plants fifty acres with seed an' a hoe
Come Fall, you get lost in the tall corn rows
Don't need no phone where she come from;
She just holler down the mountain and the boys all run.(Fast)
You might see her truck rollin' outta the woods
With a 12 point buck laid across the hood
If you don't get the picture by now
Then wait a minute

Chorus repeated:
She got a bible; she's born again
She got a shotgun; she ain't afraid of sin
She got rebel-rousin', rowdy friends singin', whoa whoa whoa
She got a Trans Am, with a trailer hitch
She got horses, cows and Dixie Chicks
Goes honky-tonkin' just for kicks
If that ain't country
I don't know what is

If you don't get the picture by now
Then wait a minute

Chorus repeated:
She got a bible; she's born again
She got a shotgun; she ain't afraid of sin
She got rebel-rousin', rowdy friends singin', whoa whoa whoa
She got a Trans Am, with a trailer hitch
She got horses, cows and Dixie Chicks
Goes honky-tonkin' just for kicks
If that ain't country
I don't know what is

I don't know what is
I don't know what
I don't know what is

The grass was green, the sky was blue
Had my Sunday clothes, my shiny shoes
My Dad had teardrops rolling down
As they put Grandpa in the ground
Only 8 years old, but I remember everything
That changed me

Her breath smelt like bubblegum
She kissed me in front of everyone
I wiped it off for all my friends
But my heart wouldn't let me wash my hand
Seventh grade I acted just as cool as cool could be
And that changed me

I guess some moments in this life are stepping stones
They shape you, and take you a little farther on
And Heaven only knows exactly where they lead
Or who I'll be, when God's through changing me

Twnety One with my new wife
She sure changed my life
I thought love so deep don't happen twice
But it did

My last name on her little wristband
I had to call my Mom and Dad
Describe her tiny nose and ears
I didn't even try to hide my tears
'Cause holding that baby made me a different man
Yea that changed me

I guess some moments in this life are stepping stones
They shape you and take you a little farther on
And Heaven only knows exactly where they lead
Or who I'll be, when God's through changing me
And he's still changing me


You ought to shoot that last  one down now
Pass on that one more round now
Closing in onto 8:30

But you're all wrapped up in the right now

No reason to go home lonely

For you to give up like that
Somebody had to break your heart in two
But that ain't me and you
So tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You can't look me in the eye
What am I supposed to do?
When you say we're through
Why do you?


Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you


One day you're gonna love again
Mess up and let somebody in
To every part of your whole world
You think it's unthinkable girl
But somebody's gonna break those walls
Somebody's gonna watch you fall
Gonna give it your all and I hope that I'm around
When you finally find out why you


Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you


So tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You can't look me in the eye
What am I supposed to do?
When you say we're through
Why do you?


Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you


Somebody had to hurt you bad
For you to give up like that
Somebody had to break your heart in two
But that ain't me and you

Twenty-five just yesterday
Partied too hard, slept too late
Poured water on the frosted flakes
'Cause the red cap milk's gone sour

With a pounding head he works all day long
When he gets off, he don't go home
Puts on a little glove box cologne
And heads off to happy hour

And that's a man without a woman
Lonely and lost, no use at all, a boat without an ocean
Talk about somethin' that ain't much good for nothin'
And that's a man without a woman

Wakes up and he's 36
Got a house, two cars and kids
And the wife left town 'cause her mama's sick
And she's left him in charge

Now it's junk food lunch in a Walmart sack
They're late for school and their clothes don't match
The beds ain't made and the kitchen's trashed
And there's toys out in the yard

And that's a man without a woman
Lonely and lost, no use at all, a boat without an ocean
Talk about somethin' that ain't much good for nothin'
And that's a man without a woman

Now he's 81 just sitting there
Next to an empty rocking chair
And it's been a year he's been alone
Wonderin' what the good Lord's waiting on

And that's a man without a woman
Lonely and lost, no use at all, a boat without an ocean
Talk about somethin' that ain't much good for nothin'
And that's a man without a woman


Down in Louisiana bayous by and by
A peirot pole or your natural soul
Keeps you tied to a tree high tide
Beer joint lights come on
And then crowd starts rolling in
Pretty soon you got stars on the water
You got stars on the water
You got stars on the water
When it rains


Beaumont to Biloxi sea breeze at your door
Gypsy rains dang hurricanes
White silver sandy shores
Blue light lounge is shining
Why out on the pier
Makes it look just like stars on the water
Just like stars on the water
Just like stars on the water
When it rains


When it's midnight down in Mobile
Shining moon beams on the bay
They come from miles around
To dance the jukebox down
Th hear the good time sounds they play
And all across the harbor night life shining on
Makes you feel just like stars on the water
Just like stars on the water
Just like stars on the water
When it rains

Got a boat, got a car, got a house with a yard:
I'm still workin the best job I've ever had
But I'd give it all away, every dollar that I've made
If I could only bring you back

There's a door that I keep closed; there are boxes full of clothes
But it's memories I'm wishin I could pack
I would retrace every step; say the things I should have said
If I could only bring you back

But there's no words I can say:
Not a prayer I can pray
No road that you can take back to my arms
But you'll never be gone:
Our love will live on
As long as there's a beat in my heart

There's a smile that I still see, a voice callin out to me
And a longing in my soul I've never had
I wish I could touch your face, I would even take your place
If I could only bring you back

But there's no words I can say:
Not a prayer I can pray
No road that you can take back to my arms
But you'll never be gone:
My love will live on
As long as there's a beat in my heart

Got a boat, got a car, got a house with a yard:
I'm still workin the best job I've ever had
But I'd give it all away, every dollar that I've made
If I could only bring you back
If I could only bring you back


They're playing guitars with stars their eyes on Broadway
They're just paying their dues
And waiting for news on a big break

I wish you were here
'Cuz sometimes I get lonely
Guess I'm not the only new girl in town


Momma, I promise I'll be alright
I'll call to say I love you every night
I'm just tryin' to write the story my life
You know all about this dream I gotta chase
I get a little closer everyday
California is not that far away
I'm not that far away


There's so many new faces
And beautiful places in this town
I'm learnin' the ropes on this crazy road
I'm goin' down

I'm makin' my way
No one said that it'd be easy
Trust me
Believe me
I'm where I belong


Momma, I promise I'll be alright
I'll call to say I love you every night
I'm just tryin' to write the story my life
You know all about this dream I gotta chase
I get a little closer everyday
California is not that far away
I'm not that far away


We're miles apart
But you're in my heart
I keep you with me everywhere I go


Momma, I promise I'll be alright
I'll call to say I love you every night
I'm just tryin' to write the story my life
You know all about this dream I gotta chase
I get a little closer everyday
California is not that far away
I'm not that far away

I'm not that far away
I'm not that far away


Okay I forgot about the trash
I didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache
I did buy you a ring I believe it was back in '93
Alright I admit it I forgot our anniversary
But I did pick up the baby this morning at the nursery
That ain't no big thing but it's a gold star for me


You get tired and disgusted with me
When I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked the Lord to try to help me
He looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient I'm a work in progress


I'm sorry I got mad waiting in the truck
It seemed like hours you getting all dressed up
Just to go to Shoney's on a Wednesday night
I read that book you gave me about Mars and Venus
I think it's sinking in but I probably need to reread it
But I'm starting to see now what you've been saying is right




I know you meant well when you gave me those clogs
But my heels sure get hot down by the muffler on my hog
I'm sure they're stylish but I'll take my boots
I try to do that healthy thing like you want me to do
But that low fat, no fat's getting hard to chew
Now I love your cooking honey
But sometimes I need some real food




Oh honey just be patient now
I'm a work in progress


There's still black marks on that county road
Where we drag raced our pick-ups and Mustangs
And weathered all the sun and rain
And to this day up on that overpass
Even underneath the new paint, you can still see
"Allie, will you marry me?"


Take a ride, look around
There ain't no doubt


It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town


There's still a rope burn on that old branch, that hangs over the river
I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far
There ain't a corner of this hallow ground
That we don't laughed or cried on
It's where we loved, lived and learned real life stuff
It's everything we're made of


It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town


Everywhere, there we are
It hits me right in my heart


It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down
And we'll always be hanging around
Like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town


She rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress
Hotter than the heat in July
With her wind-blown hair; it just wasn't fair
The way she was blowin' my mind
Have you ever noticed every hurricane
Gets its name from a girl like this?
She's a cat five kind, keeps you up at night
Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss


She's a beautiful mess
Yeah, the kind you love to love
But what happens next?
I got a feelin' when the sun comes up


I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'


Ain't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels
Somewhere between going and gone?
You get so lost that you can't turn it off
You give in and you just turn it on
She's a heart full of rain, red lips like a flame
She's a girl from your favorite song


What a beautiful mess
One part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck
The kind of flood you'll never forget


I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'


I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love


I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
Yeah, I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign, gonna wish I had a sign
Of a storm warnin', yeah


A little heads up, little more time
Little leeway some kind of sign (some kind of sign)
Oh, would've been nice
Some kind of radar system
If I heard it, yeah, I would've listened
To the storm, to the storm warnin'


People talkin' ’bout what is and what ain’t country
What gives ’em a right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth


You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing


I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not've been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country


Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know


Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not've been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country


Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out


I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country


You do your kinda country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country


Well I don’t do things like I used to
Well I don’t stay gone like I used to
Well I don’t drop the ball, let everything go wrong
No I don’t do things like I used to
And I can’t believe the way you love me
Well I don’t deserve the way you love me
Well I've caused so many tears, honey why are you still here
Well I can’t believe the way you love me


Well I wake up every morning
Glad another day is dawning
And I start my day with a kiss and a cup of coffee
Man I sure don’t want to leave
As soon as I’m gone I want to get back home
And love you all night long
Honey, once you fall asleep
I’m going to hit my hands and knees
Yea and thank God he made a woman
Love a man like me


Well I’d do anything, girl to keep you
Forever in these arms I’m going to hold you
Well I've come to understand, just how lucky I am
Well words just can’t explain how much I need you




Thank God he made a woman
Love a man like me

I'm catching green lights now
More than I catch red
And maybe it's in my head
But I've got this feeling
I was lost, I was stuck
Trying to find my way
But that's all yesterday
I've got this feeling
'Cause the sun is out
And it feels like heaven's
Shining down
It's clearer now
And everything's going to be alright
I've got this feeling
It's a better day
And it feels like winning
Like I'm saved
A new beginning
Baby you're the reason
Why I've got this feeling
The way you hold my hand
Yeah, it fits just right
And I don't know what love feels like
But I've got this feeling
I'm seeing you and me
I'm seeing down the road
I can't see how far it goes
But I've got this feeling, I've got this feeling
The sun is out
And it feels like heaven's
Shining down
It's clearer now
And everything's going to be alright
I've got this feeling
It's a better day
And it feels like winning
Like I'm saved
A new beginning
Baby, you're the reason
Why I've got this feeling
When I found you
It helped me find myself
I guess it's true
When it's meant to be you can tell, baby, I can tell
'Cause the sun is out
And it feels like heaven's
Shining down
It's clearer now
And everything's going to be alright
I've got this feeling
It's a better day
And it feels like winning
Like I'm saved
A new beginning
Baby you're the reason
Why I've got this feeling


Grandma and grandpa painted a picture
Of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory
More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnights
And I love you’s
Me and you baby
We’ll walk in their footsteps
We’ll build our own family
One day at a time
10 little toes
A painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you


And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up


This life will go by in the blink of an eye
But I wouldn’t wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth’s gonna shake
But I’ll be your shelter
Through the wind and the rain


And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up


Someday we’ll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won’t trade for nothin’ this life that we built
I’ll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still


And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
From the ground up

Lying in the green grass
Underneath the blue sky
Looking at a good man
Who oughta be the right guy
He's got that kinda heart that
Any girl would die for

So, how could I want more?
How could I want more?

Treats me like a princess
Let's me have it my way
I can tell he's hanging
On every word that I say
All he does is love me
Swears that's what he's here for

So, how could I want more?
How could I want more?

More fire, more feeling
More stars than what I'm seeing
More hope for what I'd find behind that door
More power, more passion
Instead of just acting
Like I'm the one that he's been looking for

I oughta say I'm sorry
I oughta say it's over
Let him live his own life
Stop crying on the shoulder
He'd probably say it's alright
And hold me while me tears pour

So, how could I want more?
How could I want more?

More fire, more feeling
More stars than what I'm seeing
More hope for what I'd find behind that door
More power, more passion
Instead of just acting
Like I'm the one that he's been looking for

Lying in the green grass
Underneath the blue sky
Looking at a good man
And I know he's the right guy
He's got that kinda heart that
Any girl would die for

So, how could I want more?
How could I want more?

He said goodbye from the edge of the porch
Like she'd been some casual friend
He said "your better off with out me
I'm not what you need"
Like her momma had said about him
He started the car
Pulled out of the drive
Didn't waste any time lookin' back
She watched him go
Thinkin' even a stranger
Would show more compassion than that

She could've cried but she didn't have time
She had a baby to feed
A pink blanket to find
To rock their little one to sleep
She could've laid in bed for hours
Giving misery the power
But she didn't have time

She got a sitter,and she got a job
'cause she had a promise to keep
Her day was a factory and evening survival
At night was exhaustion and sleep
Sometimes she felt life was passing her by
And watching was all she could do
Her friends said "you gotta get outta the house
And maybe you'll meet someone new"

She could've tried
But she didn't have time
She had a five year old to feed
She had ballet class, piano lessons
And t-ball little league
She could've laid awake for hours
Giving lonely nights the power
But she didn't have the time

Not time where would she find the time
To trust a man again
Not time for that flat tire
A crowded parking lot and then
Not time but yes have coffee with the man
Who got her tired fixed
She was thinking gosh he's handsome
When he asked do you have kids

She could've lied
But she didn't have time
All she said was "she's five"
He said "i saw the car seat I love kids
Does she have your eyes?"
And they sat and talked for hours
Giving destiny it's power
She could've been afraid
To fall in love that night
But she didn't have time

She could've been afraid
To fall in love that night
But she didn't have time

I can make a woman weak
I can make a small man stand tall
I can start wars
And I can put an end to them all
I can chain you down and I can set you free
I can make you feel so high and bring you down to your knees

My name is Money
Money is my name
Well hello my name is Money
Money is my name

I can make it? rain on you
But Lord I sure do shine
I can bring you love
But I'm not the settle down kind
I can make your eyes light up
Put a dazzle in your smile, yeah
I can make you die for me without a single question why

My name is Money
Money is my name
Well hello my name is Money
Oh yeah, Money is my name
Oh yeah, yeah

I can show you who your friends? are
I can show you who they are not
Hey, I change your mind without a second thought

My name is Money
Oh yeah, Money is my name

All the pretty girls think it's sexy
When the rich boys say my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hello my name is Money
Oh yeah, Money is my name!
Well hello my name is Money
Yeah, Money is my name

Hello, my name is Money!
Hello, hello, oh Money
That's my name
Say my name
Oh won't you say my name
I wanna hear you say my name

Well I left for work in a hurry
I rushed out the door without saying goodbye
I didn't tell her I loved her this mornin'
But I'll tell her tonight I thought to myself

An as I hurried off towards the highway
This truck outta nowhere caught me by surprise
He missed me by inches an my life passed in front of my eyes
I guess that's the reason that they say

Dance every dance an live each day'
As though it's your last
An tell those that you love how you feel
Before it's too late
Life is right here and now
We only go around just one time
So embrace'em and don't waste'em
For these are the days of our lives

Well son as my my legs stopped a shakin'
Took a deep breath an turned my car around
Oh,I'm gonna take that vacation
That we talked about startin' right now

Although I know tomorrow will be here for me
'Cause nothin' in life is for certain but death's guaranteed
And that's the reason that I say

Dance every dance an live each day
As though it's your last
An tell those that you love how you feel
Before it's too late
Life is right here and now
We only go around just one time
So embrace'em and don't waste'em
For these are the days of our lives

Yeah,life is right here and now
We only go around just one time
So embrace'em and don't waste'em
For these are the days of our lives
Yeah


I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's got to be a little rain sometime
When you take you got to give so live and let live and let go oh oh oh oh
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden


I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well, if sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter


So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can




I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You'd better look before you leap still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about






Born the middle son of a farmer
And a small town Southern man
Like his daddy's daddy before him
Brought up working on the land
Fell in love with a small town woman
And they married up and settled down
Natural way of life if you're lucky
For a small town Southern man


First there came four pretty daughters
For this small town Southern man
Then a few years later came another
A boy, he wasn't planned
Seven people living all together
In a house built with his own hands
Little words with love and understanding
From a small town Southern man


And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man


Callous hands told the story
For this small town Southern man
He gave it all to keep it all together
And keep his family on his land
Like his daddy, years wore out his body
Made it hard just to walk and stand
You can break the back
But you can't break the spirit
Of a small town Southern man


And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man


Finally, death came calling
For this small town Southern man
He said it's alright 'cause I see angels
And they got me by the hand
Don't you cry, and don't you worry
I'm blessed, and I know I am
'Cause God has a place in Heaven
For the small town Southern man


And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man


Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man


Girl you've never known no one like me
Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man


I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My Mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man


I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to loving you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man


I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Sept to do the best I can
I'll be damned
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man


I may be a real bad boy
Oh but baby I'm a real good man
Yes I am


When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone

I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home


So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer


Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense


So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer


So long my friend
'till we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to...


Sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer, yeah

I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a hair cut
Ironed up a pearl snap, left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I dialed her up some more George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the water's edge, big sky turnin' red
That perfect night, she said she can't forget

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I did it for that long hair, fallin' down, layin' on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss

I did it for the girl dancin' on the front porch
Reachin' out to grab my shirt, pull me through the front door
Did it for the midnight, candlelight
Anything to make her mine, all mine, I did it for the girl
I did it for the girl


Car door slams, it's been a long day at work
I'm out on the freeway and I'm wondering if it's all worth
The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close and you hold me tight


And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half


They say behind every man is a good woman
But I think that's a lie
Because when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side
You don't know how much I count on you to help me win
When I've given everything I got and I just feel like giving in
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and you hold me tight


And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half
Uuuuh I need your love

Well, you take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and I understand
It's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe that we can make it through anything


Baby it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half

Oh oh baby you're my better half
Oooh, hey baby you're my better half

It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughnin' coal pile, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
Gentle on my mind
You are gentle on my mind


Vámonos!


Save me from this prison
Lord, help me get away
Cause only you can save me now from this misery
I've been lost in my own place, and I'm gettin' weary
How far is heaven?
And I know that I need to change my ways of livin'
How far is heaven?
Lord, can you tell me


I've been locked up way too long in this crazy world
How far is heaven?
And I just keep on prayin', Lord, and just keep on livin'
How far is heaven?
Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?
How far is heaven? (Cause I just gotta know how far, yeah)
How far is heaven? (Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?)


Tu que estas en alto cielo
Echame tu bendicion


Cause I know there's a better place than this place I'm living
How far is heaven?
So I just got to have some faith and just keep on giving
How far is heaven? (Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?)
How far is heaven? (Cause I just got to know how far, yeah)
How far is heaven? (Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?)
How far is heaven? (Cause I just gotta know how far)
I just want to know how far

I'm still here, but yet I'm gone
I don't play guitar or sing my songs
They never defined who I am
The man that loves you 'til the end
You're the last person I will love
You're the last face I will recall
And best of all, I'm not gonna miss you
Not gonna miss you
I'm never gonna hold you like I did
Or say I love you to the kids
You're never gonna see it in my eyes
It's not gonna hurt me when you cry
I'm never gonna know what you go through
All the things I say or do
All the hurt and all the pain
One thing selfishly remains
I'm not gonna miss you
I'm not gonna miss you


Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Until He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!


Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine 




Oh night, Oh night divine 


You know my old car needs washing
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills aren't going to pay themselves
Don't matter anyway
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldn't have it any other way
Cause I ain't in no hurry today


Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today


When I must return
To the cold cold ground
Have them take their time
When they lay this sinner down


Heaven knows that I ain't perfect
I've raised a little cain
And I plan to raise a whole lot more
Before I hear those angels sing
(Going to get right with the lord)
But there'll be hell to pay
But I'm in no hurry


Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
Ain't in no hurry
Ain't in no hurry today

I had a broken heart and a broken heel
And a break down when those big old wheels
Left with him and left me in a cloud of deep old dust
She was sitting there
With her beehive hair
And said, "Honey, that's a waste of good mascara."
She handed me a pink Kleenex
And I'll never forget what she said next

"Boys and buses got a lot in common
They both pick up speed when you
Try to stop 'em
You could waste your breath
You could scream and cuss 'em
But there's no use chasing after boys and buses."

She said, "Some leave with a guitar case
And some wind up at an army base
And some make out much under the hood
And some roll it on out to Hollywood
But the cost is lost when the ticket's bought
And you can't catch what don't wanna be caught
But when those tail lights start to dim
There's another one coming right around the bend 'cause

Boys an buses got a lot in common
They both pick up speed when you
Try to stop 'em
You could waste your breath
You could scream and cuss 'em
But there's no use chasin' after boys and buses

Sometimes love and transportation
Will spin their wheels and keep you waiting
But anytime you think you've missed it
Just give it ten or fifteen minutes

Boys and buses got a lot in common
They both pick up speed when you
Try to stop 'em
You could waste your breath
You could scream and cuss 'em
But there's no use chasing after boys and buses
Yeah, there's no use chasing after boys and buses."


A little boy on a big jet plane
Takin' off in the pourin' rain
They're bouncin' 'round like a basketball
He says, 'Mama what if we fall?'


She looks in those big scared eyes
'Son, think of it like a circus ride'
Next thing you know he's laughin' out loud
Sayin' 'Do it again' as the wheels touch down


I guess it's all how you look at it
You might see more than the side that you're seein'
Turn it upside down and shake it up a bit
It could be a good thing, it's all how you look at it


Businessman playin' air guitar
He always dreamed he'd be a superstar
Quits his job and starts singin' at night
Is he givin' up his livin' or takin' back his life?


I guess it's all how you look at it
You might be more than the side that you're seein'
Turn it upside down and shake it up a bit
It could be a good thing, it's all how you look at it


You've got your opinions and I've got mine
Can we agree to agree at least some of the time?
A glass half empty is a glass half full
And that's what makes life beautiful


I guess it's all how you look at it
You might be more than the side that you're seein'
Turn it upside down and shake it up a bit
It could be a good thing, it's all how you look at it


(All how you look at it)
You might be more than the side that you're seein'
Turn it upside down and shake it up a bit
It could be a good thing, it's all how you look at it

My married friends keep asking
When I'll settle down
They tell me time is passing
And there's not too many good ones still around
I tell them I am not afraid to be alone
And there's no need to rush into something wrong

So I'm not gonna worry
No, I'm in no hurry
It's in the hands of fate, there's nothing I can do
And it might be tomorrow
Or the one that follows
Got the rest of my life to look forward to
'Cause every day is one day closer to you

You might be in Montana
Living in the hills
Or you might be in Virginia
Working in a mill
All I know is that I haven't found you yet
And, who knows, maybe we've already met

So I'm not gonna worry
No, I'm in no hurry
It's in the hands of fate, there's nothing I can do
And it might be tomorrow
Or the one that follows
Got the rest of my life to look forward to
'Cause every day is one day closer to you

Oh, every day I pray that God will keep you safe
'Cause I know you're out there somewhere

So I'm not gonna worry
No, I'm in no hurry
It's in the hands of fate, there's nothing I can do
And it might be tomorrow
Or the one that follows
Got the rest of my life to look forward to
'Cause every day is one day closer
Yeah, every day is one day closer
Every day is one day closer to you, yeah

This time i wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene straight off the silver screen
so I'll be holdin' my breath
Until that moment when
I find the one that i spend forever with

If it's a long long road
Baby I'll walk it
If it's a mountain high
Baby I'll cross it
If it's a deep blue sky
You know I'll jump out in it
There's nothing i would not do for you
There's no limit

If you want my heart
You can have it
If you want my soul
You gotta grab it
If you want my love
Then baby come and get it
There's nothing i would not do for you
There's no limit

Let's pack that Pontiac and say goodbye to Hollywood
Climb into the back and just get on with feeling good

(Instrumental)

Let's pack that Pontiac and bid goodbye to Hollywood
Slide into the back there's nothing wrong with feeling good...
Feelin' good

If it's a beat-up heart
I'll mend it
If it's a broken smile
I'll bend it
If it's a barbed wire fence
You know I'll take my chances
There's nothing i would not do...
'Cause honey you're living proof
There's no limit...mmmhmmm

If it's a long long road
You can have it
If it's a mountain high
You gotta grab it
If it's a deep blue sky
Take your chances (there's no limit)
Ooh ooh ooh

If it's a long long road
There's no limit (there's no limit)
There's no limit (3x)

Man I hate you found me here, With whiskey on my breath
I know I should be ashamed, so much for those twelve steps
He said "No my son, I know you're doing your best
With all you've been through,hey I understand
I only came In here to be your friend
You know she still asks about you
And wonders how you're doing and where you've been

Tell her I'm in Tampa on the causeway, watching the waves roll in
Tell her I'm in Aspen, in a cabin, finding myself again
Tell her that I'm happy and I've moved on
Better than I've ever been
Just don't tell her that you saw me drowning in this bottle
Trying to make her disappear
Tell her I'm anywhere, anywhere but here

It would only break her heart if she knew the truth
You see I told her when she left, this was the last thing I would do

Tomorrow, I swear I'm starting over again
I've made it this far and I know how It ends
But she doesn't have to find out where I am
So if you see or hear from her again

Tell her I'm in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
Selling cars five days a week
Tell her I'm in Mobile Alabama
Getting back on my feet
Tell her that I'm happy and I've moved on
Looking better than you've ever seen
Just don't tell her that you saw me drowning in this bottle
Trying to make her disappear
Tell her I'm anywhere, anywhere but here

Tell her that I'm happy and I've moved on
But let her know that I still care
Man Tell her I'm anywhere, anywhere but here


Well, I got a bumper sticker on the back of my truck
There ain't another like it cause I had it made up
I can tell who's behind me, they give themselves away
Lay on their horn when they read this phrase


Honk if you honky Tonk, don't if you don't
But if you do, don't you love to, honk if you honky tonk


Me and Friday night go hand in hand
Ice cold beer and a swinging band
A girl on my arm that won't let go
She caught my little sign about a mile ago




Well, just the other day I was cruising through town
Sheriff pulled me over, I thought I had it now
I rolled down my window, he said with a grin
"I want one of them stickers or I'm gonna run you in."




Honky if you honky tonk
I hear ya honking, yeah
I'm pulling over, let's honky tonk


At a diner down on Broadway they make small talk
When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup
He jokes about his love life
And tells her he's about ready to give up
That's when she says, "I've been there before
But keep on looking because maybe who you're looking for is"


Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody


Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
It's that blue-eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one maybe he could fall in love with




Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
A moment they'd both missed until that day
When he saw his future in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waiting on




Last night in memphis
Tonight in new orleans
Tomorrow ill be miles from here
Ain't nothing to me nothing to me
Sweet gypsie highway
Won't you let me chase my dream
Cause I gotta song to take me there
And its something to see something to see


Lord i was born with a suitcase in my hand
Living in a life that few could understand
Sometimes it gets so confusing
That i dont know where i am
But i always know who im with
Im with the band


Cheap whiskey midnight
Another round with my friends
Watching the world through the windshield
And we're rolling again rolling again




Last night in memphis
Tonight in new orleans
Tomorrow ill be miles form here
Ain't nothing to me nothing to me


If I could grant
You one wish
I'd wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh, I love watching you, baby
When you're driving me crazy


Ooh, I love the way you
Love the way you love me
There's nowhere else I'd rather be (drives me wild)
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me (love me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the way you love me


It's not right
It's not fair
What you're missing over there
Someday I'll find a way to show you
Just how lucky I am to know you


Ooh, I love the way you
Love the way you love me
There's nowhere else I'd rather be (drives me wild)
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me (love me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the way you love me


You're the million reasons why
There's love reflecting in my eyes


Ooh, I love the way you
Love the way you love me
There's nowhere else I'd rather be (drives me wild)
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me (love me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the way you love me (love me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the way you love me (love me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the way you love me


Ooh, the way you love me
Ooh, I love the way you love me
The way you love me
The way you love me
The way you love me
The way you love me


For me it's a beach bar
Or on a boat underneath the stars
Or with my band up on a stage
For a while everything's okay
For some it's a fast car
Moonshine in a Mason jar
And everybody has their way
Somehow to escape


Reality, yeah, sometimes life
It is not all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
Because everybody needs to break free from reality (yeah yeah)


Yeah, some days it's a bitch, it's a bummer
We need a rock and roll show in the summer
To let the music take us away
Take our minds to a better place
Where we feel that sense of freedom
Leave our worries behind, we don't need them
All we need is a sunny day and an old tailgate
And we'll escape


Reality, yeah, sometimes life
It is not all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
Because everybody needs to break free from reality


Everybody raise your hands and voice tonight
Set your soul free, let's take a carpet ride
We'll leave it all behind
Oh oh


Reality, yeah, sometimes life
It is not all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
Because everybody needs to break free from reality yeah yeah


Come on everybody, break free
Come on everybody, break free


Hey girl, hey where you going?
Come back and sit back down
You look too good to be heading home so early now
You say you got to work tomorrow
Got a lot on your mind
Let me buy another round
Girl I think you and I should just


Drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it


We can talk rocket science
Jesus or politics
How your boyfriend cheated on you
Man he sounds like such a prick
I could use another whiskey
And your Cosmo's getting low
While we're trying to figure out
The next place we should go


We can drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it


This place is closing down
But I don't want to quit
Got to good thing going girl
Let's find out what it is


And drink on it
Your place or mine
Girl we can drink on it
Dust off a bottle and drink on it
Feels like we're doing something right
Let's find a corner of the night
Where you and I can just drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it


Might make a memory that we won't forget


So let's just drink on it
Yeah
Mm
Drink on it
Sleep on it
We can just drink on it

There's an old friendly breeze that blows
In the Gulf of Mexico
Somehow it always knows
When I'm feeling low

So I'm gonna anchor down
Wait til it comes around
Leave the rest of the world behind
Yeah that's how I'll pass the time

Chorus:
Til I catch my second wind
Get back up and gain control again
Find the strength I lost back then
When you stopped loving me
I guess I'll just stay out here
Til I know the coast is clear
Sit and watch the tide roll in
Til I catch my second wind

There's a peace in the way I feel
When the water's still
And as long as its calm out here
I've got time to kill
But as soon as it starts to stir
I'll loose track of the way things were
Float away on the open air
I'm not going anywhere

Chorus:
Til I catch my second wind
Get back up and gain control again
Find the strength I lost back then
When you stopped loving me
I guess I'll just stay out here
Til I know the coast is clear
Sit and watch the tide roll in
Til I catch my second wind

I guess I'll just stay out here
Til I know the coast is clear
Sit and watch the tide roll in
Til I catch my second wind

Just sit and watch the tide roll in
Til I catch my second wind


So here we are, here all alone
The band quit playing, everyone went home
But the stars are still out and you're so damn hot
And I ain't ready for the music to stop


Baby, be my love song
Baby, be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rocking 'til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, "Oh hell yeah!"
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along coming on
Baby be my love song


Girl, fast or slow, three-quarter time
It don't have to make sense and it don't have to rhyme
As long as it's you babe, I'm all in
And when it's over, just play it again


Baby, be my love song
Baby, be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rocking 'til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, "Oh hell yeah!"
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along coming on
Baby be my love song


Baby, be my melody
My little feel good that gets to me
Don't be shy baby, set it free
Crank it up, hit me way down deep


Baby, be my love song
Baby, be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rocking 'til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, "Oh hell yeah!"
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along coming on
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along coming on
Baby be my love song
Baby be my love song
Oh yeah
Be my love song
(Be my love song)

Sign said cold beer, so I pulled in there
Pulled up a chair, to have just one
Now my head hurts, I got this sun burn
Oh what on earth have I done

How'd I wind up in Jamaica
Washed up like some lost cast away
How did one round of beer lead to me laying here
On this bed of sand in Montego Bay

Hey don't I know you, ain't you the girl who
I was talking to, back at the bar
Your dress was light green and I had on blue jeans
Tell me what's it mean, when we don't know where they are

How'd I wind up in Jamaica
Was it your wild hair or was it mine
Oh I barely remember, you cussing December
As you passed me that salt and the lime

It's been a year now, we're still here now
All settled down, might not go back again
Like a couple of beach bums, we hardly work much
Still ask each other every now and then

How'd we wind up in Jamaica
Was it your wild hair or was it mine
Oh who cares it don't matter we're happy ever after
Now pass me that salt and the lime

We got it made here in Jamaica
I wouldn't have it any other way

To this day it ain't clear all I know is we're here
On this bed of sand in Montego Bay

E'd say can't never could do nothin'
And weights what broke the wagon
There ain't no fence between right or wrong
Sometimes you gotta fight if you wanna get along
You better stand up when that flag gets raised
Or down on your knees when it's time to pray
But the greatest thing about him to me
Was the fact that he believed

Chorus:
He believed in the good Lord above
A straight shootin rifle and the power of love
He believed in why the blood was shed
And if he couldn't be free he'd rather be dead
And to never give up on your dreams
But most of all yeah most of all he believed in me

Well he had his own opinion
About the world and its condition
Spare the rod spoil the child
You'll reap what you sow if you let it grow wild
You just gotta deal with the hand you're dealt
Never give up and you'll never really fail
But the greatest thing about dad to me
Was the fact that he believed

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
Oh and just because of him I know who I am today
And just because of that I know where he's gone to stay

Repeat Chorus

One day you'll see her and you'll know what I mean
Take her or leave her, she will still be the same
She'll not try to buy you with her time
Nothing's the same as you will see when she's gone

It's foreign on this side
And I'll not leave my home again
There's no place to hide
And I'm nothin' but scared

You dream of colors that have never been made
You imagine songs that have never been played
They will try to buy you and your mind
For only the curious have something to find

It's foreign on this side
And the truth is a bitter friend
Reasons, few have I
To go back again

Your first dawn blinded you, left you cursing the day
Entrance is crucial and it's not without pain
There's no path to follow once you're here
Climb up the slide and then you'll slide down the stairs

It's foreign on this side
But it feels like I'm home again
There's no place to hide
But I don't think I'm scared

(There's no place to hide)
(There's no place to hide)
But I don't think I'm scared
(There's no place to hide)
But I don't think I'm scared


I got my game on
I step out of the shower steaming up the place
Wipe off the mirror, shave my baby face
Can't help but smile, hey what can I say
I got my game on
Put on my black silk shirt, my Armani suit, my custom made hat, my alligator boots
Slip my rings on my fingers, my new shades
Oh, I got my game on


Yeah I got my game on, better hang on tight
I guarantee it's going to be a hell of a ride
I got my groove on, I got my smooth on
Yeah you ladies better watch out tonight
I got my game on


Get to the club in my caddy with my custom 24's
Flip my keys to the valet and I'm ready to roar
They're going to know the second I strut through the door
I got my game on




That little hottie at the bar, just game me a wink
Flashed my Platinum card and buy her a drink
From that look she's giving me son it's a damn good thing
I got my game on better hang on tight
I guarantee it's going to be a hell of a ride I got my groove on
I got my smooth on, going rock star crazy tonight
I got my game on


Yeah I got my game on, game on now baby
I got my game on

There's a fast food bag wadded up in the backseat
Rohrer fence post starin' right back at me
Gatorade fill at the 7-11
Still hotter than hell in the shade at seven

Cash my check
Fill up the tank
Buy you a flower
And buy us a drink
To sip on
To live on
Watchin' that summer drip on
Fields of green
And baby I wouldn't change a thing


It ain't always pretty, but you are
It ain't easy, girl, but it ain't too hard
Meet you at the corner pub, save me a seat
Won't be anybody there lucky as me
A blue-collared blue-eyed worth it
Yeah, whatever we're doin' is workin'
Like Jack and Diane, just singin' our ditty
Life goes on, it ain't always pretty
But you are

There's a Mickey Mouse magnet on a Frigidaire
Holdin' me and you laughin' at the county fair
Merry-go-round and round it goes
Just like these dusty nowhere roads
It's either too dry, or rainin'
It's either hurry-up, or waitin'
I love it that you like the way I sing
Sunday mornin', cigarette, Amazing Grace


It ain't always pretty, but you are
It ain't easy, girl, but it ain't too hard
Meet me in the back pew, save me a seat
Won't be anybody there lucky as me
A blue-collared blue-eyed worth it
Yeah, whatever we're doin' is workin'
Like Jack and Diane, just singin' our ditty
Life goes on, it ain't always pretty
But you are
Whoa you are

We'll get it wrong or get it right
Funny thing about this beautiful life


It ain't always pretty, but you are
It ain't easy, girl, but it ain't too hard
Meet you on the front porch, save me a seat
Won't be anybody there lucky as me
A blue-collared blue-eyed worth it
Yeah, whatever we're doin' is workin'
Like Jack and Diane, just singin' our ditty
Life goes on, it ain't always pretty
But you are
Whoa you are

They're playin' our song, baby, sing it with me
Life goes on, it ain't always pretty
But you are


I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothing but a towel on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumping
But he ain't got nothing on you
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then locking the door yeah
Sounds like leaving you, oh


It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that


Love the sound of the thunder rolling
Makes you move a little closer to me
Girl I bet that your neighbors hate us
Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
We can worry 'bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle, lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do


It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that


Turn your radio on, baby turn down the lights
I ain't going nowhere, I'm all yours tonight


It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, and I love the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that


I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Yes I do (I like the sound, I like the sound of that)


She's beautiful in her simple little way
She don't have too much to say when she gets mad
She understands; she don't let go of anything
Even when the pain gets really bad
I guess I should've been more like that

You had it all for a pretty little while
And somehow you made me smile when I was sad
You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart
And then you realized you wanted what you had
I guess I should've been more like that


I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie
I guess you got what you deserved
I guess I should've been more like her


Forgiving you, well, she's stronger than I am
You don't look much like a man from where I'm at
It's plain to see desperation showed it's truth
You love her, and she loves you with all she has
I guess I should've been more like that


I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie
I guess you got what you deserved
I guess I should've been more like her


She's beautiful in her simple little way

World's greatest mystery love between a woman and a man
Some guys are Romeos others simply do the best they can
I'm just your average ordinary Joe
Trying to learn the things I never knew I had to know
What's a man supposed to do I can't get no kick from 9 to 5 No no
And I'm not a man who thinks its true it's a womans place to keep our love alive
I watched an empty time TV to know my baby's needs
Sometimes I swear shes impossible to please

(Chorus)
She says you give me all that I want of your money babe but you never take me dancing
Never take me dancing
You give me sweet little talk call me honey babe but you never take me dancing
Never take me dancing

Think I do a lot to show how I feel about her in my ways
Roses on our anniversary, candle light and me on her birthday
Just when I thought that I had it all worked out
She says I still don't know just what it's all about

(Chorus)
She says you give me all that I want of your money babe but you never take me dancing
Never take me dancing
You give me sweet little talk call me honey babe but you never take me dancing
Never take me dancing

I'm just your average ordinary Joe
Trying to learn the things I never knew I had to know

Yeeeeeeeee yee
Yeeeeeeeee yee yeeeeeee yeee
Yeeeeeeeee yee yeee

You give me all that I want of your money babe but you never take me dancing
Never take me dancing
You give me sweet little talk call me honey babe but you never take me dancing
Never take me dancing
You give me sweet little talk call me honey babe but you never take me dancing
Never take me dancing

Give me sweet little talk call me honey babe (till fade)

Verse 1:
He's got an I love Jesus fish stuck on his bumper
With a rebel flag rippin' like a razor in the wind
A sign sellin' watermelons and cucumbers
And common advice you might need now and then

Bridge:
Ya, He parks there off the pavement just slightly in a ditch
He's got a two-tone tattered lawn chair where he smokes his pipe and sits
And when the sun goes down the price goes down, and everybody knows
There ain't one second that'll tick past seven that he ain't headed home

Chorus:
But you can come back early in the morning
Get what you need fresh from the garden
A little less ripe if that's how you like it
If you ain't tried it you better not knock it
If you didn't go to church the Sunday before
You can hear all about it and a little bit more
About what it takes to make a man a man
Down at Henry Cartwright's back home, home grown, prayer and produce stand

Verse 2:
His daddy passed down the ground to raise it
The know how and the plow he used to make it
And when you sink your teeth in it's a sin to taste it
And if you had to stand in line it's worth the wait!

Bridge:
Ya, He parks there off the pavement just slightly in a ditch
He's got a two-tone tattered lawn chair where he smokes his pipe and sits
And when the sun goes down the price goes down, and everybody knows
There ain't one second that'll tick past seven that he ain't headed home

Chorus:
But you can come back early in the morning
Get what you need fresh from the garden
A little less ripe if that's how you like it
If you ain't tried it you better not knock it
If you didn't go to church the Sunday before
You can hear all about it and a little bit more
About what it takes to make a man a man
Down at Henry Cartwright's back home, home grown, prayer and produce stand

Oh, you can come back early in the morning
Get what you need fresh from the garden
A little less ripe if that's how you like it
If you ain't tried it you better not knock it
If you didn't go to church the Sunday before
You can hear all about it and a little bit more
About what it takes to make a man a man
Down at Henry Cartwright's back home, home grown, prayer and produce stand

Tag:

We got potatoes, vine ripe tomatoes
Big yellow squash, and oh my gosh
If you need revival, he'll read the Bible
And mend your life to mind the Lord

Verse 1 (repeat first two lines):
He's got an I love Jesus fish stuck on his bumper

(Alecia Elliott/Andy Bohatiuk/Bill Terry)

Some guys-ooh,they're really something
They're always acting like they're so hot
And you-you don't seem any different
I keep a wishin' but I guess you're not

You wanna what?I don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that
You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last
You wanna what?

Those eyes-ooh,I see right through'em
The way you stare gives you away
Don't even go there-ooh,you just don't get it
Real love can't be that way

You wanna what?I don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that
You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last
You wanna what?

Ooh,don't you think you oughta be ashamed
Ooh,I hate to tell you I don't play that game

You wanna what?I don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that
You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last
You wanna what?

You wanna what?I don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that
You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last
You wanna what?

(Hal-Lelujah)

Just this side of Heaven there's a little white house
Take a ride at the Pearly Gates: go 'bout a quarter mile south
There's an Angel sittin' on a front porch swing
In a cotton gown waitin' on you gettin' in

Hallejulah, I can see the shimmer of the porch light glow
Hallejulah, I can see her shadow in the soft halo
Gonna take her in my arms an' hold her tight
Love her like a devil and spend all night just this side of Heaven

Just this side of Heaven, I was a lonely soul
Till I found my salvation in the woman I hold
I swear her love is spiritual:
Nothin' short of a miracle for me

Hallejulah, I can see the shimmer of the porch light glow
Hallejulah, I can see her shadow in the soft halo
Gonna take her in my arms an' hold her tight
Love her like a devil an' spend all night just this side of Heaven

And her hair falls down like a gentle rain
Makin' music, gonna tell her, of callin' my name
Hey, yeah

Hallejulah, I can see the shimmer of the porch light glow
Hallejulah, I can see her shadow in the soft halo
Gonna take her in my arms an' hold her tight
Love her like a devil an' spend all night just this side of Heaven

Just this side of Heaven

Just this side of Heaven


Well the reindeer pull the sleigh
And the elves make the toys
Those are the stories that are well known to all
Little girls and boys

But I've got another story
That I bet you haven't heard
Did you know that Santa
Has a secret agent bird


He's Penguin, James Penguin
That dapper little guy
Like a well dressed duck in a three piece tux
He's Santa's secret spy


Have you ever wondered
How Santa keeps tabs
How he knows when you've been good
How he knows when you've been bad




From an undisclosed location
He's watching me and you
He's got satellite up links in his cuff links
Yeah he sees everything you do




Not so very long ago
Santa didn't need much help
But with more and more kids every year
He soon got overwhelmed
He told the elves one Christmas
We can't do this anymore
Then a knight in shining polyester
Waddled through his door


And it was Penguin, James Penguin
He was there to save the day
He had wireless
And GPS outfitted on the sleigh


And Santa said Penguin
Won't you be my ears and eyes
How'd you like to help me run
My SCFBI


He's Penguin, James Penguin
And now I guess you've heard
How Santa got his little Christmas
Secret Agent Bird


Dear Hate
I saw you on the news today
Like a shock that takes my breath away
You fall like rain, cover us in drops of pain
I'm afraid that we just might drown


Dear Hate
Well, you sure are colorblind
Your kiss is the cruelest kind
You could poison any mind
Just look at mine
Don't know how this world keeps spinning 'round and 'round


You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all


Dear Hate
You were smiling from that Selma bridge
In Dallas, when that bullet hit and Jackie cried
You pulled those towers from the sky
But even on our darkest nights
The world keeps spinning 'round


You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all


Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh


Dear Love
Just when I think you've given up
You were there in the garden when I ran from your voice
I hear you every morning through the chaos and the noise
You still whisper down through history and echo through these halls
And tell me love's gonna conquer all
Gonna conquer all

We met in memphis
In a small caffee downtown
She was in for business
I was just on my way out
She was looking lonely over there sipping on a coffee cup
Me being the friendly kind i jus couldn't pass this up
So i made my way all over to the corner booth
In my sweetest voice i said "would you care if i joined you"
With a smile she said yes
It was love working in memphis, tennessee, it was meant to be
I could never have known that day she was 'bout to come my way
It was someone else's plan, i guess
I fell in love right there in memphis
We stayed by the river in some town's house hotel sleep
And we made love all night long till we drifted off to sleep
I woke up in paradise
She laying there by my side
With the sound of wedding bells ringing in my mind
So i asked that morning
As we layed there in the sheets
I can't imagine a sweeter sound than the way she answered me
With a smile she said yes
It was love working in memphis, tennessee, it was meant to be
I could never have known that day she was 'bout to come my way
It was someone else's plan, i guess
I fell in love right there in memphis
So i asked that morning
As we layed there in the sheets
I can't imagine a sweeter sound than the way she answered me
With a smile she said yes
It was love working in memphis
With a smile she said yes
It was love working in memphis, tennessee, it was meant to be
I could never have known that day she was 'bout to come my way
It was someone else's plan, i guess
I fell in love right there in memphis
We fell in love right there in memphis


I softly kiss your neck, and slowly whisper
You breathe in cause it feels cold where my lips were
T-shirt for a pillow, music up real low, creeping through the window
I can feel the bass line in the bed liner, and your heart on mine
Tryin' to jump up out of your chest


Baby you're now on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on


The moonlights tracing those tree tops across your face
There's a feeling in your eyes the shadows can't erase
The cool wind around us is breezing around us
Following my fingers through your hair
The engine is idling and girl this heat lightning is flashing
Pictures of you and burning them in my head


And I'm on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on


I'm tuned in to you, something's on your mind, ain't it?
Go on and tell me baby, don't act like you can't say it
I know your body language, you ain't gotta translate it
Let it talk to me, till I can't take it
Your lips, your hair, your smile, your touch, your kiss, your stare
Your vibes too much
It lights me up, you got me set
I'm way too gone, so baby let your eyes close
Say my name and watch me goin' up in flames


Girl I'm on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, where the wild things are
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods parked under the pines
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

It's always been inside my head
Suddenly hardwood floors and feather beds
And children laughing, running up and down the stairs
It would be heaven without going nowhere

And when a dream starts coming true
It feels like destiny, like I already knew
Like you were meant for me, and me for you
And it feels like I'm right where I've always belonged
And it feels just like a love song

The way we talk, the way you smile
You kiss my lips, it drives me wild
I never knew until I felt your touch
That I could need someone so much

And when a dream starts coming true
It feels like destiny, like I already knew
Like you were meant for me, and me for you
And it feels like I'm right where I've always belonged
And it feels just like a love song

Tell my raining goodbye, it's all blue skies
It feels like coming home
And it feels just like a love song

Feels like destiny, like I already knew
Like you were meant for me, and me for you
And it feels like I'm right where I've always belonged
Oh yeah, I'm right where I belong
And it feels just like a love song
It feels just like a love song

I could go for a tipsy tailgate kiss
Baby taste the moonshinin' off of your lips
I want to see that 'want ya' smile
Still got me hooked, been hooked for awhile
If you got a bottle you ain't opened yet
And an empty spot beside ya in ya bed
If you got some room for a little regret
Let me know girl I've already left...


If you're feelin' what I'm feelin' let's mix it up
You got my number baby hit me up
If you need a little late night pick me up
I, hope you get lonely tonight
We ain't gotta make up, just kiss me
We could straight up blame it on the whiskey
You ain't gotta wake up and miss me, no
I hope you get lonely tonight


I don't care if you're spinnin' in the neon
Or burnin' up the sheets with my tee on
Either way the thought is turning me on
And I can't shake it girl I'm wide awake, so

We used to pull off Highway 249
Had a cool little place where we'd go and hide on Friday night
And get away from the city lights
We'd find a little wood and build a fire
Somebody'd always bring a couple guitars
And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
We'd do "Ramblin' Man", "Proud Mary", and "American Band"
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs


It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs always the love songs


There was always a line that stuck in your head
That was said in a way you wished you could've said
But you both knew they were singin' it right to you
It felt so good those times you had
That feelin' of wanting somebody so bad
Made you weak in the heart you couldn't take being apart
Honky Tonk drinkin' songs we could do 'em all night long
But the ones we remember most




This is for the nobody
The one in the crowd who's got a
Lost look on his face
This is for the down trotted
The one that the world's forgotten
Waitin' on a better day
Well, I'm in no position to judge him
Heaven knows they're just like me


And I'm not alone and knowing what it's like
To wonder where you're going in this crazy life
And I'm not alone, knowing how it feels
To pray to God and sometimes wonder if he's real
'Cause I got friends that do, yeah, I got friends that do


This is for the lost junkie
Who spends all his hard earned money
On something that he hates
And this is for the found guilty
Who ain't getting out until he
Pays his debt to the state
I'm in no position to judge him
Heaven knows it could have been me


And I may not know what it's like
To lose your job 'cause a habit's got gripped too tight
And I may not know how it feels
To lay your head down on a prison bed in a world of steel
I got friends that do, yeah, I got friends that do


This is for yours truly
Just a little verse to remind me
We've all got somewhere to turn


And I may not know what it's like
To send my only soul to save the world and watch him die
And I may not know how it feels
To hang there on the cross to prove that love is real
But I got friends that do, yeah, I got friends that do


Yeah, I got friends that do
We know we all got friends that do

Fighting for the things you gave me
I wanna share enough
Feeling like a wounded soldier
Strength is not enough
And I can't win this battle on my own

The sword has long been buried
Piled on with dirt
Speak to me your promises
Resurrect your word

Cause I can't win this battle on my own
No I can't win this battle on my own

I'll rise up and be your voice
I made my choice
This is my story
Your songs are stored inside my heart
So break me apart
It's for your glory
Let it pour out of me
Let it pour out of me
It's for your glory

So ride out on your wings of love
Show me that you're here
Cast down on my enemies
Trembling with fear

Cause I can't win this battle on my own
No I can't win this battle on my own

I'll rise up and be your voice
I made my choice
This is my story
Your songs are stored inside my heart
So break me apart
It's for your glory

I'll rise up and be your voice
I made my choice
This is my story
Your songs are stored inside my heart
So break me apart
It's for your glory
Let it pour out of me
Let it pour out of me
Let it pour out of me
It's for your glory
It's for your glory
It's for your glory

Look at me, look at you
Laugh at them, yeah, we should laugh at us, too
Make a wish we wanna come true
Gonna get us an angel, maybe get us two

Goin' for the brass ring
Yeah, we got such big plans
Got our own dreams
You know the Big Guy's gonna give us a hand

Trouble with angels
Is you can never find one when you want one
The trouble with angels is I really want one
Trouble with angels is they're never around
Do you really need one? Yeah, I really need one

Got a feelin' it's gonna be okay
'Coz whatever happen?s gonna happen anyway
Make a wish and it may come true
An angel?s gonna come down, gonna get us through

Goin' for the brass ring
Yeah, we got such big plans
Got our own dreams
You know the Big Guy's gonna give us a hand

Trouble with angels
Is you can never find one when you want one
The trouble with angels is I really want one
Trouble with angels is they're never around
Do you really need one? I really need one

Goin' for the brass ring

Do you really need one? I need one

Trouble with angels

Redneck, blue collar
And I party down to my last dollar

I work hard, I work hard, I work hard

Now, I don't waste my time on
Manicures and spray-on tans
And I don't pay no never mind
To the callouses I've worn on my hands

You know that people just can't understand how
I'm the first to clock in but the last to pass out

I work hard, I play harder
I'm a good-timin', American daughter
Redneck, blue collar
And I party down to my last dollar

Redneck, blue collar
And I party down to my last dollar

I work hard, I work hard, I work hard
I work hard, I work hard, I work hard
I play harder


The mixtapes got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at


This is how we roll...
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio, woah...
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon, baby
This is how we roll...


Yeah baby this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me, yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you, but it's for me though
Let's roll!


This is how we roll...
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio, woah...
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you, baby
This is how we roll...






Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass it around and we dream about one day


'Cause this is how we roll... (come now)
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio, woah... (get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up)
We light it up with our hands up

This is how we do
We burnin down the night shootin bullets at the moon
Baby this is how we roll… (BK, Tyler)
(one more time, let’s go)
Yeah this is how we roll (this is how we roll)…


I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me?
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you


This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby you're the only one I run to
I run to you


We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slipping right on through
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you


This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby you're the only one I run to
I run to you, whoa oh, oh I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby you're the only one I run to
I run to you, I run to you yeah, whoa whoa, oh I run to you
I run to you girl, whoa whoa

We all know life can be a grind
Eight day weeks and overtime
Thats just the way it is
We all got dreams we're working for
Pushing hard and wanting more
And settling for less

But baby when you love me
You show me
That only one thing really matters
You're love, you're sweet touch
Is the strength that I lean on
They could take it all in a New York minute
It wouldn't matter as long as your in it
My life is complete
Baby when you love me
Baby when you love me

Don't want the rats to win the race
So we keep it at a frantic pace
Can't afford to fall behind
Ain't that just the way it goes
Traffic jam on my way home
But I just shake my head and smile

Cause baby when you love me
You show me
That only one thing really matters
You're love, you're sweet touch
Is the strength that I lean on
They could take it all in a New York minute
It wouldn't matter as long as your in it
My life is complete
Baby when you love me
Baby when you love me
Aw baby when you love me

When I finally get home to you
Everything that I've been through
Slowly drifts away

Baby when you love me
You show me
That only one thing really matters
You're love, you're sweet touch
Is the strength that I lean on
They could take it all in a New York minute
It wouldn't matter as long as your in it
My life is complete
Baby when you love me
Baby when you love me
Aw baby when you love me

Shoulda seen the look on the face of the boss of the second shift
When I threw my hard hat at him
An' suggested the box where he could stick it
I walked downstairs an told 'em I was leavin' Bethlehem
Like I'd seen the Saviour, had tears in my eyes
Holdin' my hands up an' shoutin': "Amen."

'Cause there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do
I spent most of my life a-wrapped up tight
In somebody else's hand-me-down old shoes
Startin' today, I'm someone I'd be proud to know:
You might tell me where to go
But there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do

We buried Daddy just last week at the church to save his soul
Man, he dreamed of pilot's wings:
Spent his whole life diggin' coal
I got a guitar under my bed, but I've been too scared to fly
But that's enough of that stuff, I'm packin' up my truck:
They can just kiss my butt goodbye

'Cause there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do
I spent most of my life a-wrapped up tight
In somebody else's hand-me-down old shoes
Startin' today, I'm someone I'd be proud to know:
You might tell me where to go
But there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do

'Cause there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do
(Ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do.)
I spent most of my life wrapped up tight
In somebody else's hand-me-down old shoes
Startin' today, I'm someone I'd be proud to know:
You might tell me where to go
But there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do


I left, out of Tucson, with no destination in mind
I was running from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life, romance
And that's why I thought I should go
And start my life over on the seashores of old Mexico


My first night in Juarez, lost all the money I had
One bad senorita made use of one innocent lad
But I must keep on running; it's too late to turn back
I'm wanted in Tucson, I'm told
Yeah, and things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico


Two Mexican farmers en route to a town I can't say
Let me ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where I slept on the seashores of old Mexico


After one long siesta, I came wide awake in the night
I was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
My new-found companion, one young senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico


She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico


Yeah, she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know, ha, ha
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico



We can't be friends, you can't drop by
If I run into your brother, can't tell him to tell you hi
You can't call, I can't pick up
We can't meet for margaritas, I can't wear that dress you love

Cause you'll look at me like I want you to
Then we'll brush hands like we accidentally always do
We'll stay too late, we'll laugh too hard, hug too long
And that ain't too far from waking up right where we've always been

We can't be friends, we both know that
You can't tell me you don't love her and I've got no right to ask
So I'll pretend like I don't care
I won't send a birthday card and if you see me out somewhere

Don't look at me like I want you to
Cause we'll brush hands like we accidentally always do
We'll stay too late, we'll laugh too hard, hug too long
And that ain't too far from waking up right where we've always been

We can't be friends

We can't be friends, it's just too tough
It's not that I don't love you, it's that I love you way too much
And we'll just end up here again
We can't be friends


You will notice me
I'll be leaving my mark like initials carved in an old oak tree
You wait and see
Maybe I'll write like Twain wrote
Maybe I'll paint like Van Gogh
Cure the common cold
I don't know but I was ready start because I know in my heart


I want to do something that matters
Say something different
Something that sets the whole world on its ear
I want to do something better
With the time I've been given
And I want to try
To touch a few hearts in this life
Leave nothing less
Than something that says "I was here"


I will prove you wrong
If you think I'm all talk, you're in for a shock
Because this dream's too strong
And before too long

Maybe I'll compose symphonies
Maybe I'll fight for world peace
Because I know it's my destiny
To leave more than a trace of myself in this place


I want to do something that matters
Say something different
Something that sets the whole world on its ear
I want to do something better
With the time I've been given
And I want to try
To touch a few hearts in this life
Leave nothing less
Than something that says "I was here"


And I know that I will do more than just pass through this life
I'll leave nothing less than something that says "I was here"


"I was here"
(I was here)
"I was here"
(want to do something that matters)
(Something that says I was here)
"want to do something that matters"
(Something that says I was here)
"I was here"

His old man was a rebel yeller
Bad boy to the bone
He'd say, "Can't trust that other feller"
He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin

He was raised to think like his Dad
Narrow mind, full of hate
On the road to nowhere fast
Till the Grace of God got in the way

Then he saw the light and hit his knees
And cried and said a prayer
Rose up a brand new man
Left the old one right there

Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change

Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change

She was born with her mother's habit
You could say it's in her blood
She hates that she's gotta have it
As she fills her glass up

She'd love to kill that bottle
But all she can think about
Is a better life, a second chance
And everyone she's letting down
She throws that bottle down

Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change

Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change

Thank God for those who make it
Let them be the light
(Let them be the light)

(Some people change)
Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change

Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change
(Some people change)

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ, the Savior is born
Christ, the Savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord at thy birth
Jesus, Lord at thy birth

Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace


Have a holly jolly Christmas
It’s the best time of the year
I don’t know if there’ll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet


Oh ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss him once for me


Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn’t hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly
Christmas this year






Santa Claus is coming to town


I don't want to get up, baby lets turn off the phone
I don't want to go to work today or even put my make-up on
I got better things to do than my to-do list anyway
Hide under the covers and waste away the day
Let's just lay here and be lazy, baby, drive me crazy


All I want to do
All I want to do..... is love you


I got my whole life to change the world and climb the ladders
Looking at you looking at me is the only thing that matters
Come a little closer baby, we can talk without words
Hang a sign on the door, "Please do not disturb"
Let's just lay here and be lazy, baby, drive me crazy


All I want to do
All I want to do..... is love you


Give me a kiss, from that Elvis lip
You don't want to miss this


All I want to do.....
All I want to do..... is love you


All I really want to do is
All I really want to do is
All I really want to do is love you and love you and love you
Come a little closer baby we can talk without words
Hang a sign on the door
"Please do not, please do not, please do not, please do not disturb"


When I lay down in the evening
All I really want to do is
When I wake up when I wake up in the morning baby
All I really want to do is
Ooo......
Ooo......


Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand, so I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye, like nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air the California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything so I sang along


She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?


So I just hung around this little west coast town
I dropped by every night, I stayed till closing time
My little mystery, that girl is killing me
So I put on a song just to sing along


She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about


So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know


You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?

Life ain't always beautiful
Sometimes it's just plain hard
Life can knock you down, it can break your heart

Life ain't always beautiful
You think you're on your way
And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day

But the struggle makes you stronger
And the changes make you wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

No, life ain't always beautiful
Tears will fall sometimes
Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride

Life ain't always beautiful
Some days I miss your smile
I get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles

And I wish for just one minute
I could see your pretty face
Guess I can dream, but life don't work that way

But the struggles makes me stronger
And the changes make me wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

No, life ain't always beautiful
But I know I'll be fine
Hey, life ain't always beautiful, but its a beautiful ride
What a beautiful ride

I rode around long enough
With my windows down
Let that breeze roll in, carry your perfume out
I took your number and messages off my phone
Oh, but you ain't gone

Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

Seems like your memory, has got a map of my mind
No matter where I go, you find me every time
Alone or in a crowd, I hear you whispering baby
It's driving me crazy

Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

Damn, you're hard to forget
Oh oh oh

Yeah, wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, you still got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head
You're nowhere close to being gone outta my head
Mmm, outta my head

No you ain't gone
No you ain't gone
Yeah outta my head


Don't tell me I'm too hard to please
That you're worn down from fighting for me
A real man knows what he's signing up for
And if you don't then I'll show myself the door


Cause I'm worth it
You're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it
I ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it
And give me the love I'm deserving
Cause I know I'm worth it


Is it too much to look me in the eye
And listen to what I'm saying this time
I'm so tired of being up on your shelf
And if that's what you want
You want somebody else


Cause I'm worth it
You're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it
I ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it
And give me the love I'm deserving
Cause I know I'm worth it
Cause I know I'm worth it (worth it)


Don't tell me I'm too hard to please
You should be begging down on your knees


Cause I'm worth it
You're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it
I ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it
And give me the love I'm deserving


Cause I know I'm worth it

Cheater, cheater where'd you meet her
Down at Ernie's Bar?
Did she smile your way, twirl her hair and say how cute your dimples are?
Did she use that line "Your place or mine?" while you danced with her real slow?
Tell me cheater, cheater where'd you meet that no good, white trash ho?

Liar, liar did you buy her whiskey all night long?
Did you hide your ring in the pocket of your jeans or did you just keep it on?
When the deed was done and you had your fun did you think I wouldn't know?
Tell me cheater, cheater where'd you meet that no good, white trash ho?

Now I'm not one to judge someone that I ain't never met
But to lay your hands on a married man is bout as low as a gal can get
Hey I wish her well as she rots in hell and you can tell her I said so
Cheater, cheater where'd you meet that no good, white trash ho?

Loser, loser hope you love her cuz your stuck with her now
Take your sorry butt, load up all your stuff, and get the hell out of my house
But I just wish you'd tell me this one thing before you go
Cheater, cheater where'd you meet that no good, white trash ho?

Now I'm not one to judge someone that I ain't never met
But to lay your hands on a married man is bout as low as a gal can get
Hey I wish her well as she rots in hell and you can tell her I said so
Cheater, cheater where'd you meet that no good, white trash ho?

Yeah I just wish you'd tell me this one thing before you go
Cheater, cheater where'd you meet that low down, up town, slept with every guy around, pressed on eyelash, no good, white trash ho?


There's a place I like to go
Where I can here the cotton grow
When that train whistle blows
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still


There's the place I love to be
Momma daddy my sister & me
First time I ever saw the beach back to 1983
All I really have to do is just be still
When this world gets crazy
And tries to break me
And I had all I can stand
I can close my eyes no matter where I am
And just be still


There's a place I like to go
Where I can here the cotton grow
When that train whistle blows
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still


When this world gets crazy
And tries to break me
And I had all I can stand
I can close my eyes
No matter where I am
And just be still


There's a place I like to go
Where I can here the cotton grow
When that train whistle blows
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still


Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountain, Shenandoah river
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

[Chorus 1: Little Big Town, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert
Blake Shelton & George Strait]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads


If I should stay
All my memories, they gather round her
I would only be in your way
A miner's lady, stranger to blue water
So I'll go, but I know
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
I'll think of you every step of the way
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye


Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
(I will always love you)
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads


On the road again
Like a band of gypsies, we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way


Country roads (Country roads), take me home (Take me home)
To the place I belong
(I will always love you)
West Virginia, mountain mama
(Will always love you)
Oh, take her home, country roads


Oh, I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love


And I will always love you
I will always love you
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads
And I will always love you
On the road again
I will always love you
I just can't wait to get on the road again
Country roads
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
I will always love you
I can't wait to get on the road again
Take me home, country roads
I will always love you
I'll always love you


Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby


Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s popping right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said


Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise


She was sipping on Southern and singing Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"


Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise


When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right


I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumping
Hell, I can't get you out of my head


Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you


Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise


Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww, yeah

Stayed out about two hours too late
An' now it's hard gettin' out of this bed
Man, my boyfriend was a pain in the butt last night
Now he's an ache in my head
Stubbed my toe on the dresser an' I guess
It's too late to shower an' do my hair

Yeah, throw a bun cap on;
Hell, half the day is gone
And nothin' else could go wrong, whoa, oh
Fifity bucks is all I got:
When times are tough, it's time to shop
An' my credit card'll buy a lot, whoa, oh
What's another bill to pay?
It's that kind of day
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Got twenty-six messages on my voicemail
An' I've only called my best friend back
An' I told her: "When it comes to my life these days
"I'm somewhere between a cry an' a laugh."
She said my Mom just called her
An' said I look like I've gained five pounds

Ho, oh, slip into my fat jeans
Overdose on mint ice-cream
Treat the day just like a dream, whoa, oh
Hope I see someone I know
An' I'll smile an' put on a show
Say I got somewhere to go, whoa, oh
Everyone's got something to say:
It's that kind of day
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, whoo

:. Instrumental break .:

Standin' still on the interstate
An' I swear some old lady
Just flipped me the bird
Did she just flip me the bird?

Ha ha, it's gotta go up from here
Today is gonna disappear
An' nothin's gonna interfere, whoa, oh
Gonna buy myself some flowers
An' then spend a couple a-hours
Talkin' to my Higher Power, whoa, oh
Ask Him why life's this way
(Ask Him why.)
Yeah, I'm gonna ask Him why my life's this way
(Why's my life this way?)
There's just no tellin' what He's gonna say
Oh, it's just that kind of day

Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah-a
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah-a
Yah, oh yeah, yey

Every dollar I make
Is a buck I owe
And a forty-hour week
Leaves ten to blow
But every game in this town
Is just a nickel and dime
And when the sun goes down
It feels like the last time
Down on the main drag
We ride the engine's open
If there's a fire inside
That's the one thing goin'

I've got the Mustang loaded
I've got a wrong to right
I got a little red bullet
Let's kill Saturday night
Knock it out of its misery
Nail that coffin tight
High livin'
That's history
Let's kill Saturday night

Well the little man's lot
Is a prince's life
A prince with a lousy job
A prince with a workin' wife
Something in the big frame moved
It never was so hard
To keep a twenty-inch tube
And a fenced-in yard
But give me one night
With the moon high
And the radio poundin'
An' brother this town
Is gonna go down
A kickin' and shoutin'

I've got the Mustang loaded
I've got a wrong to right
I got a little red bullet
Let's kill Saturday night
Knock it out of it's misery
Nail that coffin tight
High livin'
That's history
Let's kill Saturday night
Hey

I've got the Mustang loaded
I've got a wrong to right
I got a little red bullet
Let's kill Saturday night
Knock it out of it's misery
Nail that coffin tight
High livin'
That's history
Let's kill Saturday night

Let's kill Saturday night


Well I won't make you tell me
What I've come to understand
You're a certain kind of woman and
I'm a different kind of man
I've tried to make you love me
You've tried to find a spark of the flame that burned and
Somehow turned to smoke ring in the dark
The loneliness within me
Takes a heavy toll
Because it burns as slow as whiskey
Through an empty aching soul and
The night is like a dagger
Long and cold and sharp
As I sit here on the front steps
Blowing smoke rings in the dark


I- I- I know I must be going
Because loves already gone and
All I'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart and
All I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark


The rain falls where it wants to
Wind blows where it will
Everything on earth goes somewhere
But I swear we're standin' still
So I'm not going to wake you
I'll go easy on your heart
I'll just touch your face and drift away
Like smoke rings in the dark


I- I- I know I must be going
Because loves already gone and
All I'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart and
All I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark

There's every kind of definition
But it's something you can't put your finger on
There's a constant exhibition
You explore the propositions, then you're gone
It's either money or love that's in your catch
Seldom those two ever match
And then lines will all be blurred before too long

Now there is a slight deception
As you look for all the reasons not to run
And without any exception
Every possible exemption can be done
It's either money or love you're digging for
Seldom love is valued more
But only love can tell you who's the one

There is a lot you can do with money, sometimes
It seems like a blessing from above
In the day you might be shopping
But in the nighttime, you better make sure it's love

To get your satisfaction
You might take any guarantee that comes along
But without the main attraction
Though It's merely a distraction then again you're gone
It's either money or love you're diggin' for
Seldom love is valued more
But only love can tell you who's the one

Yeah, there's a lot you can do with money, sometimes
It seems like a blessing from above
In the day you might be shopping
But in the nighttime, you better make sure it's love

You better make sure it's love
You better make sure it's love
I said, you better make sure it's love
Well, you better make sure it's love

(Money or love) you better make sure
(Money or love) you better make sure
(Money or love) you know you better make sure it's love

--- Instrumental to fade ---
(Money or love), (Money or love), (Money or love)
(Money or love)...


Imagine a dirt road full of potholes
With a creek bank and some cane poles catching channel cat
I'm a little more country than that
Picture a small town with an old hound
Laying out front of the courthouse
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that


I just want to make sure you know just who your getting under this old hat
Cause girl I'm just not the kind of two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that


Think of hank song with a days gone
With a steel ride this old song that sends chills up your back
I'm a little more country than that
If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl you're way off track
I'm a little more country than that


I just want to make sure you know just who your getting under this old hat
Cause girl I'm just not the kind of two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that


Yea I'm sure that you've heard those three words from lovers but they fell flat
But this ring ain't something that I mean to give you and then take back
I'm a little more country than that


I'm a little more country than that
I'm a little more country than that

Grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days
Sometimes it feels like
This world's gone crazy
Grandpa, take me back to yesterday
When the line between right and wrong
Didn't seem so hazy

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
And stand beside each other come what may?
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say?
Did families really bow their heads to pray?
Did daddies really never go away?
Oh, Grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days

Grandpa, everything is changing fast
We call it progress
But I just don't know
And Grandpa, let's wander back into the past
And paint me the picture
Of long ago

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
And stand beside each other come what may?
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say and then forget?
Did families really bow their heads to pray?
Did daddies really never go away?
Oh, Grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days
Oh, Grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days


It’s about fifteen hundred miles to California
They’ll get there Friday if they leave tonight
She sneaks out at 3:30 in the morning
Leaves a note so she won’t see her daddy cry
He cuts the engine
When he coasts in the driveway
She slides in and gives him one kiss for the road
No friends and no family
No job out there waiting
The whole town will call them crazy
But they gotta go


Cause when you’re young and in love, yeah
You might do some things that don’t seem all that smart
Cause there ain’t no greater distance
Than the eighteen inches from your head to your heart, yeah


They can barely make rent on a rundown apartment
She’s waiting tables and he’s a valet
They’re behind on the bills and the car’s barely running
But he buys a ring with the tips that he’s saved


When you’re young and in love, yeah
You might do some things that don’t seem all that smart
Cause there ain’t no greater distance
Than the eighteen inches from your head to your heart


Last thing they need is another mouth to feed
But they want one
They’re just kids themselves
But that’s gonna change in nine more months


She wakes him up at 3:30 in the morning
Ready or not, their new life’s gonna start
Seven pounds and eighteen inches
The doctor lays that new baby’s head right on her heart


When you’re young and in love, yeah
You might do some things that don’t seem all that smart
But thank God for those eighteen inches
The distance it is from your head to your heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Heyyah
Heyyah
Hey, heyyah


Barhoppers, churchgoers
Marlboro Light smokers
Blue collar, red voters
Population 1,009
Past year’s cheerleaders
Old men fill the bleachers
Skeptics, true believers all
Gathered on a Friday night
Singing to the stars and stripes


We’re a drinking town with a football problem
With two main things we all have in common
We love ‘em both and don’t want to solve ‘em
We’re a drinking town with a football problem

Huh, heyyah
Singing, heyyah
Hey, heyyah



Barn burners, nail biters
Shift workers, firefighters
Prom queens, outsiders
All livin’ for the love of the game
We still tell the same old story
Relive former glory
Went to state in ‘94
We got a trophy in the school hallway
The kids pass it by each day


We’re a drinking town with a football problem
With two main things we all have in common
We love ‘em both and don’t want to solve ‘em
We’re a drinking town with a football problem

Hey, hey


When we win, we celebrate
And when we lose, we commiserate
Win or lose, oh we tie one on


We’re a drinking town with a football problem
With two main things we all have in common
We love ‘em both and don’t want to solve ‘em
We’re a drinking town with a football problem

Hey, say
Heyyah (hey yeah)
Heyyah
Hey, heyyah, wow yeah


I don’t see you laugh
You don’t call me back
But you kiss me when you’re drunk
I don’t know your friends
Don’t know where you’ve been
Why are you the one I want?


Don’t put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can’t stay
Don’t slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it’s okay
Don’t say it doesn’t matter cause it’s gonna matter to me
I can’t be alone with you
You’ve got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I can’t be alone with you


Please don’t chain that door
I can’t win this war
Your body’s like a pill I shouldn’t take


Don’t put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can’t stay
Don’t slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it’s okay
Don’t say it doesn’t matter cause it’s gonna matter to me
I can’t be alone with you
You’ve got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I can’t be alone with you
Don’t put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can’t stay
Don’t slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it’s okay
Don’t say it doesn’t matter cause it’s gonna matter to me
I can’t be alone with you
You’ve got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I can’t be alone with you


I don’t see you laugh
You don’t call me back
But you kiss me when you’re drunk


Girl you've had one of those days
Seems like they've been going around
You're a long way from being where you wanna be


When the world isn't going your way
Whatever bad luck is getting you down
Honey, I'll be right here for you
With open arms, you can run to me


Baby, love's gonna make it
Love's gonna make it alright (alright, alright)
Baby, love's gonna make it
Love's gonna make it alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight


We can go out and paint the town
We can dance your cares away
We can watch'em all fall out on the floor

And if you want to we can close'em down
And we can leave whenever you say
I'll chase you down the hallway
Watch the sun come up behind our bedroom door




That's the good thing girl about me and you
There ain't nothing that loving can't get us through




Tonight, tonight, tonight

You look like an angel
I wanna touch you
Come a little closer
There's not much that we can do
Oh unless you
Come a little closer

If you can't see the love in my eyes
If you can't hear my heart beating fast
Then maybe, you should come a little closer
If you can't feel the electricity
Flying between you and me
Then maybe, you should come a little closer

One foot in front of the other
Come a little closer

Right now
One inch between us
Is one too many
Come a little closer
Don't resist it
Too much distance
Are you listening
Come a little closer

If you can't see the love in my eyes
If you can't hear my heart beating fast
Then maybe, you should come a little closer
If you can't feel the electricity
Flying between you and me
Then maybe, you should come a little closer

One foot in front of the other
Come a little closer
Let your heart lead you, I need you
Right here, right now, don't slow down
Keep coming, that's it, come on

Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer


Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time


And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye


Two black Cadillacs, two black Cadillacs


Two months ago his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then he’d never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time


And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye


It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave


And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know, is gunna change everything
Living with the shame
It ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she throw out the window
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring

So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain

Best thing I remember was the young familiar taste of someone on my lips
It's too late to turn around

When the shades start coming down
The guilt you feels the last thing on your mind

So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain

So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve, just let it come down on me
Let it come down on me, let it rain
Ooh let it rain, ooh let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain, ooh let it rain

Square bales, flatbeds
Clothesline sunsets
Sky blue, barn red
Wind chimes, front porch
Good dogs, wood floors
Work boots, open doors

And miles and miles of John Deere green
Freedom far as I can see
A road to run and room to breathe
That's who I am and I'll always be...

Caught up in the country
The only way I wanna be
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
That's where you can find me

With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Caught up in the country

Just look at 'em stars
Must be a billion of 'em
Just doing they thing
Right where God put 'em

If this ain't heaven it's halfway there
You can feel it in the air

Caught up in the country
The only way I wanna be
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
That's where you can find me

With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Caught up in the country (I was brought up in it)
Caught up in the country (Oh and good Lord willin')
(Yes I am my way, I'll stay...)
(Caught up in it, caught up in it)

Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
That's where you can find me

With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life

Miles and miles of John Deere green
Freedom far as I can see
A road to run and room to breathe
That's who I am and I'll always be...

Caught up in the country
Caught up in the country
Caught up in the country

Let's jump in my El Camino - Uh huh
Roll the windows down
Thought we could see what kind of trouble
We can find out on this messed up little town

The Boss on the radio- uh huh
Take whatever comes
We'll go flying down the highway with my arms around you singing Born To Run

It feels just like it should
Must be some kind of miracle
Like I got sun on my face and the rain ain't never going to fall
It feels so good
Oh It is almost spiritual
Tomorrow's nowhere in sight
Right now, right here tonight
It feels just like it should

Well you got your good looks - uh huh
And you got your style
And I'd drown here in this ccean
Just to have you float my boat for a while
I got a reputation - uh huh
Don't you worry about that
Just give me a chance and we'll never gonna ever look back

And it feels just like it should
It must be some kind of miracle
Like I got sun on my face and rain that ain't never going to fall
It feels so good
Man it's almost spiritual
Tomorrow's nowhere in sight
Right now, right here tonight
It feels just like it should

Maybe Romeo gets the girl this time
I guess everybody gets the chance to shine
And tonight is mine

It feels just like it should
Must be some kind of miracle
Like I got sun on my face and the rain it ain't never going to fall
Feels so good
Awww it's almost spiritual
Tomorrow's nowhere in sight
Right now, right here tonight
It feels just like it should


18 years have come and gone
For momma they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loading up that Chevy
Both trying not to cry
Momma kept on talking
Putting off good-bye
She took my hand and said
"Baby, don't forget"


Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
There's a 50 in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map, and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way


Just one more thing before you leave:
Don't forget to remember me


This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep telling me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday, I called momma up last night
And even when it's not, I tell her everything's alright
Before we hung up I said
"Hey mamma, don't forget


To tell my baby sister, I'll see her in the fall
And tell Meemaw that I miss her
Yeah, I should give her a call
And make sure you tell Daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah, I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me"


Tonight I find myself kneeling by the bed to pray
I haven't done this in a while
So I don't know what to say
But "Lord, I feel so small sometimes
In this big old place
Yeah, I know there's more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me"

I've got sun on my face
I've got food
I've got clothes
And a place where I can lay my head
I've got friends
Family
And the freedom to hope and to dream
As big as I want to
And I've got you


That's all I'll ever need
Who could ever ask for more?
I've got it all
What everybody wishes for
I thank God everyday
For the blessings this life brings
And sending your love
That's all I'll ever need

I don't have lots of fame
And I won't be the biggest of names
Up on the marquee sign
But I've got this guitar
I've got songs that I wrote from my heart
And people to sing 'em to
And I've got you


It's the little things
Like when you smile at me
That's all I'll ever need
I've got it all
Oh yeah


I've got sun on my face
I've got food
I've got clothes
I've got you
That's all I'll ever need


Beer battered chicken, sweet ice tea
Night crawlers, crickets and a Zebco 33
Old Glory waving at you
As you're driving by the court house
And it's just another day in Heaven South


A little country angel like you've never seen
Took a pair of scissors to a pair of jeans
You pick her up on Friday
And you pucker up and kiss her on the mouth
And it's just another day in Heaven South


Drive down Main Street and everybody's there
Subwoofers booming like cannons in a square
Sign says "no cruising" but nobody cares
I got a girl to put my arm around
It's just another day in Heaven South


Oh, oh, oh
It's just another day in Heaven South
Oh, oh, oh


There's a bunch of lawn chairs in the living room
There's a UFC fight on pay per view
Gonna thaw out deer steaks, got fireworks for afterwards tonight
Gotta make a little run for beer and ice


Down on Main Street and everybody's there
Subwoofers booming like cannons in a square
Turn on the news you'd think the world ain't got a prayer
If you turn it off and look around
It's just another day in Heaven South


Eggs on the griddle, coffee in my cup
Farmer on a tractor, kids on a bus
Old Glory waving as they raise her up above the court house
And it's just another day in Heaven South
Oh, it's just another day in Heaven


Oh, oh, oh
It's just another day in Heaven South
Oh, oh, oh
It's just another day in Heaven South
Oh, oh, oh
It's just another day in Heaven South
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


You’ve got the bullets
I’ve got the gun
I’ve got a hankering for getting into something

I hit the bottle, you hit the gas
I heard your 65 can really haul some ass


I’m feeling frisky, you're feeling good
I guess the whiskey is doing what it should
I got the cigarettes
You’ve got a lighter
And when the sun goes down we’ll start a little fire


Ain’t no use in trying to slow me down
‘Cause you’re running with the fastest girl in town

Ain’t you baby?
I like ‘em crazy


My reputation follows me around
Just makes me want to give them more to talk about
Let’s go to town for a little while
I’ll be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile




Come on!


I see the blue lights, we better run
Throw out the bottle and I’ll hide the gun
If he pulls us over I’ll turn on the charm
You’ll be in the slammer and I’ll be on his arm


Ain’t no use in trying to slow me down
‘Cause you’re running with the fastest girl in town

Ain’t you baby?
Well I told you I was crazy
No I ain’t no body’s baby
Hey!


He’s got the bullets
He’s got a gun
I got the hankering for getting into something


Through the dirt and the gravel
Through the years and the miles
Every road that you traveled
Through the tears and the smiles
Through the clear and the muddy
Through the thick and thin
The quiet nights, the howling wind
Through the good and the ugly
The blue and the black
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back


Through all of the words
The mean and the kind
Through the strings that unravel
And the ties that bind
From the crazy and the different
To the more of the same
From the coast is clear
To a hurricane
Yeah, I'll be right beside you
On a roll or off the tracks
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
To the moon and back


Through the bitter and the sweet
The cold and the fire
Lonely cotton sheets
And the burning desire
Until our song is over
Til the stars all fade to black
I'm gonna love you
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Yeah, I'm gonna love you
All the way to the moon and back
To the moon and back

There you go again
You take my breath away
The way you looked just then
Moves me more than words can say
Just about the time I think
I couldn't love you any more
Well then, there you go again

You're still amazing me
I shouldn't be surprised
You'd think I'd know by now
But you get me every time
The love you give
Your tender kisses
Take me places I have never been
There you go again

There you go
How'd you know
Sometimes it's like you almost read my mind
Just when I need you most
There you go again

You know it's hard for me
To tell you how I feel
I want you in my life
And I always will
Cause no elxe can touch you
When it comes to lovin' me
The way you can
There you go again

There you go
There you go again...

Five-hundred channels and there ain't much on tonight
Except reality shows about some folk's so-called lives
A pretty girl cries 'cause she don't get a rose
But she'll find love next year on her own show

And they call that real

Real is a hand you hold fifty-seven years
Real is a band of gold tremblin' with fear
It's the first long tear down an old man's face, watchin' his angel slippin' away
His heart's so broke, it's never gonna heal

I call that real

Where I live, housewives don't act like that
And the survivors are farmers in John Deere hats
Our amazin' race is beatin' the check
Prayin' that the bank ain't ran it through yet

Real, like too much rain fallin' from the sky
Real, like the drought that came around here last July
It's the damn boll weevils and the market and the weeds
The prayer they're sayin' when they plant the seeds
And the chance they take to bring us our next meal

I call that real

Real, like a job you lose 'cause it moves to Mexico
Like a mama and a baby with no safe place to go
Like a little dream-house with a big old foreclosed sign
Like a flag-draped coffin and a twenty-one gun goodbye

I call that real
Man, I call that real
Oh, I call that real

Well life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well a simple kinda life never did me no harm
A raisin' me a family and workin' on a farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funy funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the work's all done and the sun's settlin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy

I'd play sally goodin all day if I could
But the lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I could, work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funy funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds and jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
Iid rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God I'm a country boy

Yeah, city folk drivin' in a black limousine
A lotta sad people thinkin' that's mighty keen
Son, let me tell ya now exactly what I mean
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funy funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand and held me close to his side
Said, live a good life and play my fiddle with pride
And thank God you're a country boy

My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
Taught me how to love and how to give just a little
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funy funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
Thank God I'm a country boy

There's an evening dress in the closet with a red wine stain on the sleeve
Your pillow's still on the bed where we used to sleep
And in the dresser drawer there's a couple more things that smell like your perfume
But other than that there ain't much left of lovin' you

And all I got left is a big broken heart and memories I can't drink away
Just because the man I was wasn't enough to make you stay
The heaven we had, the hell that I'm going through
Other than that, there ain't much left of lovin' you

The flowers that you planted on either side of the steps out front
Before they bloom I think I might dig 'em up
And that old porch swing, those songs you sing, and the cold and bitter truth
But other than that there ain't much left of lovin' you

And all I got left is a big broken heart and memories I can't drink away
And just because the man I was wasn't enough to make you stay
The heaven we had, the hell that I'm going through
Other than that, there ain't much left of lovin' you

The heaven we had, the hell that I'm going through
Other than that, there ain't much left
The heaven we had, the hell that I'm going through
Other than that, there ain't much left of lovin' you

Yeah, there ain't much left, there ain't much left of lovin' you

If your feelin' that summertime heat
Got the top up on your jeep
Take it off, go on now take it off
Got the boat up on a trailer
Back it down in a river, take it off
Go on, now take it off

If the weight of the world's on your shoulders
Got a weaker words on your mind
Go on, do what you wanna do
Soak you up a little sunshine
Dig your hand down in a cooler
Grab a cold one and twist the top
Take it off, yeah take it off

Your a pretty little country thing
Bikini under them cut off jeans, take em' off
Come on mama take em' off
Them sunglasses on your head
Anything you don't wanna get wet, better take it off
Were jumpin' in take it off

If the weight of the world's on your shoulders
Got a weaker words on your mind
Go on, do what you wanna do
Soak you up a little sunshine
Dig your hand down in a cooler
Grab a cold one and twist the top

Take it off

Na na na na na (whoo hoo hoo)
Na na na na na

We can go fishing in the full moonlight
Get one on the line, oh take it off
Girl I'll have ya take it off
Got a blanket we can crawl underneath
If it gets to hot too sleep
We can take it off, baby we can take it off

If the weight of the world's on your shoulders
Got a weaker words on your mind
Go on, do what you wanna do
Soak you up a little sunshine
Dig your hand down in a cooler
Grab a cold one and twist the top
Take it off

Na na na na na (whoo hoo hoo)
Na na na na na
Take it off
Baby, take it off
We can take it off
Were jumpin' in take it off


If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park


Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down


Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round


We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction


Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down


Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round


Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

Oh how you sparkle
And oh how you shine
That flush on your cheeks
Is more than the wine
And he must do something
That I didn't do
Whatever he's doing
It looks good on you

'Cause ou look so good in love
You want him that's easy to see
You look so good in love
And I wish, you still wanted me

He must have stolen
Some stars from the sky
And gave them to you
To wear in your eyes
I had my chances
But I set you free
And now I wonder
Why I couldn't see

You look so good in love
You want him that's easy to see
You look so good in love
I wish, you still wanted me


Fifteen minutes left to throw me together
For mister right now, not mister forever
Don't know why i even try when i know how it ends
Looking like another "maybe we could be friends"
I've been leaving it up to fate
It's my life so it's mine to make


I ain't settling for just getting by
I've had enough so so for the rest of my life
Tired of shooting too low, so raise the bar high
Just enough ain't enough this time
I ain't settling for anything less than everything, yeah


With some good red wine and my brand new shoes
Gonna dance a blue streak around my living room
Take a chance on love and try how it feels
With my heart wide open yeah you know i will
Find what it means to be the girl
Who changed her mind and changed the world




I ain't settling for just getting by
I've had enough so so for the rest of my life
Tired of shooting too low, so raise the bar high
Just enough ain't enough this time
I ain't settling for just getting by
I've had enough so so for the rest of my life
Tired of shooting too low, so raise the bar high
I ain't settling no, no, no, no, no, no
So raise the bar high


I can hear
That highway calling
As I watch the sunrise
Crawling across her shoulder
This is usually goodbye
And yet those words
I just can't find here
As I hold her
She's like no other woman
That I have known before
And it ain't me to
See the morning sun
From this side of the door


Why ain't I running?
Why ain't I gone?
How does she hold me
Without holding on?
In love or a fight
She's stronger than strong
Something's not right
If there ain't nothing wrong
It's got me wondering
Why ain't I running?
Why ain't I gona?


All those words
I left behind me
Praying they would never
Find me and my freedom
But if they stood
Right here beside me
They would never recognise me
For all that she's done


Once happiness was only
Whenever I was on my own
So now why do I feel lonely
Any time that I'm alone




No, they've never built
A wall that high
Or made a chain that strong
And God ain't never
Made a place
I felt like I belong



(Karen Staley/Doug Kahan)

Now when I was a young girl
My dad warned me about the opposite sex
He'd say, yeah, that's just what you need
Some crazy boy with wild ideas
You know what always happens next

I tried to heed his advice
Now I'm thinkin' it sounds kinda nice

It's just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark, someone I can't resist
A little rendezvous, a little mystery
When I look at you I think that's just what I need

Now my momma told me in this dog-eat-dog world
You gotta work harder than a man
She'd say, yeah that's just what you need
Some romance book Romeo callin' you at work and messin' up your plans

Night falls, I slow down

I start dreamin' of you comin' around

It's just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark, someone I can't resist
A little rendezvous, a little mystery
When I look at you I think that's just what I need

Moonlight, sweet bliss
Melting with every kiss
Dancin' real slow
When you hold me close I know

It's just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark, someone I can't resist
A little rendezvous, a little mystery
When I look at you I think that's just what I need

Just what I need
Just what I need
Oh yeah

We sit alone in the darkest corner
Waitress comes and takes our order
And she looks at us so suspiciously
It's plain to see that we're lovers
Tryin' to be alone with each other
It's so hard for us to break free
She whispers softly I love you
This ain't your average rendezvous

Cause I'm in love with a married woman
I don't care, I don't care who know it
I'm in love with a married woman
On her left hand there's a wedding band
That she wears faithfully
And I thank God she's married to me

No cheap hotel where we'll check-in
No other lives we'll be wreckin'
With alibis to hide a cheaters kiss
'cause if there's lipstick on my collar
You can bet your bottom dollar
It's the color she wears on nights like this
Every friday here at five
I try to keep the fire alive




Ever since you left me
I've been ridin' 'round, cranking up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears
I don't know how much more missin' you I can take


I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time


There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel


I take a shot of I don't care what you're doing now
Chase that one with a cold screw you
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of someone new


That blond blonde blonde
At the bar, bar, bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart, heart, heart


There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel


When we were together
I thought life would suck forever
Even though I knew better than the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn
Gets kissed by the day break, got down on my knees


And I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time


There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel


Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night


You and me and these headlights
Engine idling in your drive
45 in a goodbye, yeah
I should probably get to goin'
Sun will rise before we know it
But while the moon is still glowing
Let me leave a little taste on your lips
A little chill runnin' under your skin
So when it's a quarter past three, you're still thinking 'bout me


Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night (yeah)


A little spray of my cologne all over your pillows
Still feels like I'm so close
Let me leave my shape in your bed
Let me leave a little song in your head
Make you dance in the dark like you're still in my arms


Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night
Mmm, oh, wanna be, I wanna be, yeah


So when you're wide awake
And I'm the only thing on your brain
Just call and I'll be there to fall right in your sheets


Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night


Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night


Ever since I met you girl, you been on my brain
I can’t think of nothing else but you all night and day
It’s like I got a first class seat up on Ozzy’s train
It’s driving me insane


5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I’m going crazy, thinking ‘bout you baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I’m going crazy, think I love you baby


I gotta get your number girl, I gotta call you up
I gotta get you riding shotgun in my truck
This little bit of you I’ve got, it ain’t good enough
Yeah, you got me all messed up


5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I’m going crazy, thinking ‘bout you baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I’m going crazy, think I love you baby


Cause I, ain’t never felt like this, no
And I, I just need one kiss, from you
And I’ll be good as new
If I don’t get some of your sweet loving no telling what I might do


5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po uhm
I think I'm losing my mind girl
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco yeah yeah yeah yeah


5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I’m going crazy, thinking ‘bout you baby
5-1-5-0, spinning my head like a yo-yo
I’m going crazy, think I love you baby

Little girl alone on the playground
Tired of gettin' teased and gettin' pushed around
Wishin' she was invisible
To them

She ran home cryin'
"Why do they hate me?"
And Mama wiped the tears and said
"Baby, you're brave and you're beautiful
So, hold your head high
Don't ever let 'em define
The light in your eyes
Love yourself, give them Hell
You can take on this world
You just stand and be strong
And then fight
Like a girl."

At 31 she was wheelin' and dealin'
Kept on hittin' that same glass ceilin'
She was never gonna one of the boys, no
She coulda gave up on her ambition
And spent the rest of her life just wishin'
Instead she listened to her mama's voice sayin'

"Hold your head high
Don't ever let 'em define
The light in your eyes
Love yourself, give them Hell
You can take on this world
You just stand and be strong
And then fight
Like a girl."

Oh, with style and grace
Kick ass and take names…

Ten years of climbin' that ladder
Oh, but money and power don't matter
When the doctor said "the cancer spread"
She holds on tight to her husband and babies
And says "this is just another test God gave me
And I know just how to handle this"

I'll hold my head high
I'll never let this define
The light in my eyes
Love myself, give it Hell
I'll take on this world
If I stand and be strong
No, I'll never give up
I will conquer with love
And I'll fight like
Like a girl!

It's been a long week
I've got a slow leak in my left front tire
I'm sick of where I work
My boss is such a jerk, don't care if I get fired

My bag's about to break
No money in the bank and she don't call me anymore
I'm down to my last drink
It's time to sell my things

And pack my bag and never look back
Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks ohh
And make my getaway
Put the pedal to the medal as the sun goes down
Leave everybody sleeping in this sleepy town tonight
At the break of day... I'll be a runaway (be a runaway, be a runaway)

A hundred miles in I got a stupid grin on my scruffly face
With every cigarette I'm burnin' my regret Don't wanna leave a trace
And from the rearview I've got a clear view of who I used to be
A little bit faster now don't wanna turn around

I'm gonna pack my bags and never look back
Run a parallel with the railroad tracks ohh And make my getaway
I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down leave everybody sleeping in this sleepy town tonight(ohh)
At the break of day I'll be a runaway (be a runaway, be a runaway) I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway be a runaway)

It's crazy I know to count on this road to give me what I need
But with every state line
Somehow I find another part of me yeah yeah

(instrumental)

I'm gonna pack my bags and never look back
Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks ohh
And make my getaway
I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down
Leave everybody sleeping in this sleepy town tonight ohh
And at the break of day I'll be a runaway

Ooooh
In every life there are detours on the gravel roads
Sometimes it feels like there's just no right way to go
There'll be times you'll go crazy
And times you'll break down
Always something that stands in your way...

Chorus:
Just keep your eyes on me
Never lose sight of me
This love
Nothing can come between
Us when we're following
This love

This love...

Everybody is bound to feel lost now and then
But I'll be the one babe, that'll be there For you 'til the end
Through good days and bad
The ups and the downs
Don't you ever let go of your dreams
Ooooh

Chorus:
Just keep your eyes on me
Never lose site of me
This love
Nothing can come between
Us when we're following
This love

Bridge:
I'll be your northern star
When everything's dark
I will shine for you
Shine for you...

Chorus:
Just keep your eyes on me
Never lose site of me
This love
Nothing can come between
Us when we're following
This love

Just keep your eyes on me
Never lose site of me
This love
Nothing can come between
Us when we're following
This love
Ohh uh-huh
Ohh

I was a boy, I was a good little boy
Wantin' in the playground fun
They said ah na ney boy you can't play
'Cause you were born a poor man's son

I met a girl, she was a pretty little girl
Would you be my only one
She said meet me where nobody can see
'Cause you were born a poor man's son

I spent all my lifetime
Thinkin' what I coulda done
While I worked my fingers to the bone

I met a man, he was business man
I said I'm a hard workin' son of a gun
He said you know the rules
You should've stayed in school
But you were born a poor man's son

I spent all my lifetime
Thinkin' what I coulda done
While I worked my fingers to the bone

I met a guy, he was a crazy guy
He said I'm goin' to get me some
Let's go across the tracks where
They keep that jack
All we need is a little black gun

They got the hounds and they
Tracked us down
They said we know what you have done
You're gonna do the time it's gonna
Fit the crime
You shoulda shot a poor man's son


Preacher said he died too young
Over there toting that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mom and Daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Started praying
Yeah he went out 21 guns blazing


And that's One Hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
Till the good Lord calls you home
And so be well, my friend
Until I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen




Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled said bring it on
If you think I'm scared
You got it all wrong
A little cancer can't break me
My heart's right and I believe
We all hit our knees
Started praying
No, he never gave up
Said the Good Lord's waiting


And that's One Hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
Till the good Lord calls you home
And so be well, my friend
Until I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen




So be well my friend
Til' I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen

Amen

It's a Hell of an Amen

Almost made you love me
Almost made you cry
Almost made you happy, baby

Didn't I, didn't I

You almost had me thinkin'
You were turned around
But everybody knows
Almost doesn't count

Almost heard you saying
You were finally free
What was always missing for you, babe
You'd found it in me
But you can't get to heaven
Half off the ground
Everybody knows
Almost doesn't count

I can't keep lovin' you
One foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation
Of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on tryin'
If you're looking for more
Than all I could give you
Than what you came here for

Gonna find me somebody
Not afraid to let go
Want a no doubt be there kind of girl
You came real close
But every time you built me up
You only let me down
And everybody knows
Almost doesn't count

I can't keep lovin' you
One foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation
Of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on tryin'
If you're looking for more
Than all I could give you
Than what you came here for

Maybe you'll be sorry
Maybe you'll be cold
Maybe you'll come running back, babe
From the cruel, cruel world
Almost convinced me
You're gonna stick around
But everybody knows (everybody knows!)
Almost doesn't count

So maybe I'll be here
Maybe I'll see ya' round
That's the way it goes
Almost doesn't count


Throw on your boots and your jeans
With the worn out seams
And your goin' out shirt
Put some shine on your truck
Get it all cleaned up just to kick it in the dirt
You point them high beam lights into drive, start comin' alive
You point them high beam lights into Friday night
And you swear this life never burns as bright
As it does now


So soak it all up, let it sink in
Crank it up loud, all the way to ten
Raise your cup to the sky
Tip 'em back to friends and let your party lights shine
On top of the world, in the back of a truck
Livin' like the sun ain't comin' back up
Yeah, buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Like it's the last time


Build you a fire, sing along
To a feel good song
At the top of your lungs
Grab a jar, twist the top
Hold your breath, take a shot
Feel the fire on your tongue
And let it drown your pride and your butterflies
Tell the girl you like what you're feelin' tonight
And pull her in tight, let the sparks ignite
Like the fourth of July


So soak it all up, let it sink in
Crank it up loud, all the way to ten
Raise your cup to the sky
Tip 'em back to friends and let your party lights shine
On top of the world, in the back of a truck
Livin' like the sun ain't comin' back up
Yeah, buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Like it's the last time


You'll be together like this
Like it's the last time
You're ever gonna taste that kiss


So soak it all up, let it sink in
Crank it up loud, all the way to ten
Raise your cup to the sky
Tip 'em back to friends and let your party lights shine
On top of the world, in the back of a truck
Livin' like the sun ain't comin' back up
Yeah, buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Like it's the last time


Yeah buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Whoa like it's the last time
Yeah like it's the last time


In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's saying, she's praying


I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
No smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)


Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise


I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
No smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)


Toy guns
Ohh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah


Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
No smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Toy guns
Oh, like little toy guns

You hold the pole and I'll try to net him
I'll wade out up to my waist
Been standin' on the bank all day hot and sweaty
We can't let this one get away
Take your time,let the line sink to the bottom
Cause we sure don't want it to break
But if the fish stop bittin' and it gets hotter
It sure feels good out here in the water

Baby just come on and jump in here with me
You can leave your clothes on or underneath that tree
It's a whole lot cooler,I really think you oughta
It sure feels good,feels good out here in the water

Just tie him off to the hitch on the bumper
Let that bad boy fight himself
If he gets loose then we'll hook another
But while we've got a little daylight left
Forget the fish,we can dish all of our troubles
Right here in this lake
It gets deeper out a bit further
It sure feels good out here in the water

Baby just come on and jump in here with me
You can leave your clothes on
Or underneath that tree
It's a whole lot cooler
I really think you oughta
Sure feels real good

Baby just come on and jump in here with me
You can leave your clothes on
Or underneath that tree
It's a whole lot cooler
I really think you oughta
Sure feels real good, feels real good, out here in the water
Out here in the water
(Feels real good) out here in the water


Oh baby, would you look right there
The way the sun is hitting your hair
The way the world just stopped right here
In mid-air, I don’t ever wanna move


You put the cool in the breeze
You put the weak here in the knees
You put me right where I’m supposed to be
In your blue-eyed sea
And I wanna sail away


'Cause when I wake up in the middle of the night
You’re holding me so tight
 my, oh, my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone


You knock me out kiss by kiss
I need you baby, sip by sip
Sit back and let me drink you in
I’m falling for you
Over and over and over again


When I wake up in the middle of the night
You’re holding me so tight
 my mind
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone


Everywhere I want to go and
Everywhere I want to be at
Everywhere I’ve ever been
Everything I’ll ever need
Is sitting right here next to me


When I wake up in the middle of the night
You’re holding me so tight
 my mind
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone

(Daryl Burgess/Michelle McCord)

Can't eat,can't sleep
All I do is think about you
Hold on,what's this feelin'
That's my heart your stealin'
Thats okay my baby,I don't want it back
Whats this chemistry,such intensity
And good emotion gettin' through

Can't get enough,go figure it
Madly,deeply,baby I'm fallin'
Head over heels,I'm livin' it
Heart and soul,your givin' it

So strong,so right,it's gotta be real
You're breakin' down the walls and fences
There's a powerful sense of
Good emotion gettin' through

It's your sweet love,I'm feelin' it
Can't get enough,go figure it
Madly,deeply,baby I'm fallin'
Head over heels,I'm livin' it
Heart and soul,your givin' it

Head over heels,I'm livin' it
Heart and soul,your givin' it
I'm thinkin' that
I'm diggin' it


Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special


Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again


Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special


A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special


Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special


And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

Oh, I'm gonna getcha good

Postcards and letters
And pictures made to last forever
To be boxed up and tossed away
Knickknacks and souvenirs
In an afternoon, they're out of here
They'll disappear without a trace
But what they mean to me
Can never be replaced

I can't unthink about you
I can't unfeel your touch
I can't unhear all the words
Unsay all the things
That used to mean so much
I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you

Interstates and old songs
Like time they go on and on
I guess I could learn to do the same
I could wake up without you
These two arms not around you
Tell myself it's meant to be this way
No matter how I try somethings I can't change

I can't unthink about you
I can't unfeel your touch
I can't unhear all the words
Unsay all the things
That used to mean so much
I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, no
Oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you

I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you


I didn't have to turn my head whenever you walked in
The only one to let these chills roll down my skin
My heart beats faster, I hear your name
I feel my confidence slippin' away


I thought I was doing fine
'Bout to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm
Wrapped around your pretty little finger again


It feels like ages since you laid down in my arms
I see no good reason but still I'm tangled in your charms
My God, you're smiling and you catch my eye
My heart is pounding deep inside




Ain't gonna let no man go down without a fight
'Cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright daylight
My heart beats faster, I call your name
I feel my confidence slippin' away




Your pretty little finger
Baby, I'm wrapped around your pretty little finger
Pretty little finger


Let’s turn it up loud, mix it up strong
Lean it back slow, get your feel good on
Cut ’em off short, roll it up tight
Let it unwind tonight
Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party’s at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi black
And don’t look back ’cause


Here’s to the good times, here’s to the sunshine
Here’s to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearing
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, she’s stealing your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just falling in her eyes
Here’s to the good times
While there’s still time


Well lay it all out, spray it on sweet
Carve it in oak and permanent ink
Park it way back, fog it on up
Singing oh, oh
Radio spilling from a single cab
She looks so good with her silver tabs
Hanging on a branch by the river
That’s a memory that’ll get you when you look back


Here’s to the good times, here’s to the sunshine
Here’s to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearing
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, she’s stealing your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just falling in her eyes
Here’s to the good times
While there’s still time


Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party’s at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi black
And don’t look back ’cause


Here’s to the good times, here’s to the sunshine
Here’s to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearing
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, she’s stealing your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just falling in her eyes
Here’s to the good times
While there’s still time

You slipped off your wedding band
And tucked it deep inside my hand
Forced a smile and headed towards the door
And as you walked out, I heard you say

"Things just haven't been going our way
And I don't love you anymore"
Now, after the day I had
I could have done without that

I'd rather watch the house we built burn to the ground
And stand out in the pouring rain, let the good Lord strike me down
Than to sit here and watch you walk away
Anything would be better than your goodbye on a bad day

I've seen that look, I can always tell
It means "Stay away from me and go straight to Hell"
That's exactly where I'll be when you're gone
And after a day like this my whole world's gone

I'd rather watch the house we built burn to the ground
And stand out in the pouring rain, let the good Lord strike me down
Than to sit here and watch you walk away
Anything would be better than your goodbye on a bad day

Oh, you're the one thing I have left
When the whole world holds me down
Now, how can I keep going
When you're not around?

I'd rather watch the house we built burn to the ground
And stand out in the pouring rain, let the good Lord strike me down
Than to sit here and have my whole world walk away
Anything would be better than your goodbye on a bad day


Eighty-nine cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hangin’ from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots
And a Go Army shirt folded in the back


This thing burns gas like crazy, but that’s alright
People got their ways of copin', oh, and I’ve got mine


I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
I drive your truck


I leave that radio playin'
That same ol' country station where ya left it
Yeah, man I crank it up
And you’d probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin’ down on my face
Hey, man I’m tryin’ to be tough


And momma asked me this mornin' if I’d been by your grave
But that flag and stone ain’t where I feel you anyway


I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
I drive your truck


I’ve cussed, I’ve prayed, I’ve said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when I’m missin' you this much


I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes (Brother, sometimes)
I drive your truck


I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
I drive your truck


I love sleeping in on Saturdays
And I love college football games
I love not acting my age
And good barbecue
Yea I'm a fan of Faulkner books
And anything my mama cooks
Small mouthed bass have got me hooked on Sunday afternoons


Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud Honky Tonk that rocks on Friday nights
And hell yes I love my truck but I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most


Man I love how Redman tastes
Dam I love my Nascar race
Any song sung by George Strait is country at it's best




Yea I love scuffed up cowboy boots
And broken torn up jeans
My 4-wheel drive and 8 point bucks
And rocky road ice cream
And hell yes I love my dog
And Jack D in my Coke
But honey I love your love
Yea I love your love


I love your love the most

(Anita Cochran)

All of my life, I've looked for love
But something inside said it wasn't enough
Then there was you
That's when I knew it was true and it feels so right
With all of my heart, my soul, and my mind
Would you put your hand in mine
And walk with me, talk with me
Come with me, let's make life complete
Dance with me, laugh with me
Forget the world and make love with me
You're everything I'll ever need
All of my strength the breath that I breathe
All of my hopes and dreams
Is you with me
Never before have I felt like this
Being with you is a heavenly bliss
I thank God above that he sent your love to me
As I hold you tight, look in my eyes
I promise you love for the rest of my life
If you put your hand in mine
And walk with me, talk with me
Come with me, let's make life complete
Dance with me, laugh with me
Forget the world and make love with me
You're everything I'll ever need
All of my strength the breath that I breathe
All of my hopes and dreams
Is you with me
And walk with me, talk with me
Come with me, let's make life complete
Dance with me, laugh with me
Forget the world and make love with me
You're everything I'll ever need
All of my strength the breath that I breathe
All of my hopes and dreams
Is you with me




No sir I ain't been drinking
I ain't even had one beer
This sweet thing's got me buzzing
From whispering in my ear


Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doing my best


And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road


Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say "girl take it easy"
She laughs, says "it'll be fine"
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines


Yeah I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
And all over the road


Something 'bout these wheels rolling
Radio playing gets her going
I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go


And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
Have a little mercy on me
Sir I'm sorry I know
I'm all over the road
All over the road
All over the road


Do you want to be a poet and write?
Do you want to be an actor up in lights?
Do you wanna be a soldier and fight for love?
Do you want to travel the world?
Do you wanna be a diver for pearls?
Or climb a mountain and touch the clouds above?


Be anyone you want to be
Bring to life your fantasies
I want something in return


I want you to burn
Burn for me, baby
Like a candle in my night
Burn
Burn for me, burn for me


Are you gonna to be a gambler and deal?
Are you gonna to be a doctor and heal?
Or go to heaven and touch God's face?
Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps?
Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps?
Or an angel under grace?


I'll lay down on your bed of coals
Offer up my heart and soul
But in return


I want you to burn
Burn for me, baby
Like a candle in my night
Burn
Burn for me, burn for me


Ohh
I want you to burn, baby
Ohh
Laugh for me
Cry for me
Pray for me
Fly for me
Live for me
Die for us


I want you to burn
Burn for me, baby
Like a candle in my night
Oh, burn
Burn for me, burn for me


I want you to burn
I want you to burn, for me, baby
Burn for me
I want you to burn
I want you to burn, for me, baby


I think I’ll take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now it’s time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years


Hey my next thirty years I’m going to have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I’ve done
Maybe now I’ve conquered all my adolescent fears
And I’ll do it better in my next thirty years


My next thirty years I’m going to settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I’m doing here
In my next thirty years


Oh my next thirty years, I’m going to watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I’ll remember my next thirty years


My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here, in my next thirty years
In my next thirty years


Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad
Another school, another house that will never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face


This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home


Young mom, on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a half-way house will never be a home
At night she whispers to her baby girl
"Someday we will find our place here in this world"


This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is our temporary home


Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers
"Don't cry for me, I'll see you all someday"
He looks up and says
"I can see God's face"


This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home


This is our temporary home

Angels We Have Heard On High
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly swinging o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria In Excelsis Deo
Gloria In Excelsis Deo
Shepherds why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?
Gloria In Excelsis Deo
Gloria In Excelsis Deo
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King
Gloria In Excelsis Deo
Gloria In Excelsis Deo
See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we raise


I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to ol' Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised


The place where he was born and raised


For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasure here on earth I've found
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now


He has no friends to help him now


It's fair thee well, my old true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that Northern Railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this train


Perhaps he'll die upon this train


You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
And you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave


While he is sleeping in his grave


Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you never will see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore


He'll meet you on God's golden shore


You know where I might be
Any given Saturday night
You know what dress to wear
How to make it look just right
When you walk by
How to smile like you just don't care
You know what drink I like
You know which songs I love
When you hit that dance floor
You know how to mess me up
How to make me love ya
No, girl, it just ain't fair


You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that it might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me


I know you remember
We shared that dance one night
Yeah, we got so close
Underneath that neon light
Then, it was over
You said you had to go
But I made you hold up
Put my number in your phone
I thought you'd hit me up
Later, when you got back home
But I never heard from you
And I'm still hangin' on


You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that end might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me


Yeah, you've got my number
But you act like
You don't even know me
And girl it ain't right
You push my buttons
And act like it ain't nothin', baby


You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that end might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me


Yeah, you've got me fallin'
But, girl, you ain't callin'
Ain't callin' me

Ever been misunderstood, misused, or misled
Ever knocked on the sky
And had it fall on your head
Well, don't worry 'bout it, don't worry
Ever lost your luggage, your marbles
Your house
Or found yourself in bed with Uncle Sam or Mickey Mouse
Ever been accused of murder on Music Row
Or caught in morning traffic when you
Really gotta go - Oh no!

(Chorus)
Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Ever sat yourself down when the
Seat is all wet
Or see your "ex" sucking face with
A little brunette
Don't worry 'bout it, no don't worry
Ever lost your religion, ever lost your
Best friend
Or found your last record in the bargain bin
Or been stuck in a divorce like crazy glue
Or scraped someone else's gum off the
Bottom of your shoe - Boo hoo!

(Repeat Chorus)
(Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah - Blah, Blah
Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah
Blah)

Don't worry, don't worry

(Bridge:)
We all got a little junk in the trunk
And when you're feelin' good as sunk
Remember, everything will be just fine
If I laugh at yours then you'll laugh at mine

(Repeat Chorus 2x)
(Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah - Blah, Blah
Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah
Blah)

Don't worry, don't worry

Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing

(thank you very much)

I'm a little used up
A little tattered at the seams
But there's still enough of me to be the man you need
I'm not faultless, I guess
Got some scratches, got some dents
Yeah, I know I've got some scars on my innocence
I got a secondhand heart
Yeah, it's a little banged up
But it's still beating strong enough
To give a lot of good love
So if you don't mind
That it's not brand new
I'll take this secondhand heart
And give it to you
What a stupid thing to do
By throwing you away
If he don't regret it yet, you know he will someday
Ooh, thank God he was blind
I thank God he let you down
For I never would have had the chance to build my world around
Your secondhand heart
Yeah, it's a little banged up
But it's still beating strong enough
To give a lot of good love
So if you don't mind
That it's not brand new
I'll take this secondhand heart
And give it to you
And you know I've been around the block a time or two
But every step I took was leading me to you
And your secondhand heart
Yeah, it's a little banged up
But it's still beating strong enough
To give a lot of good love
So if you don't mind
That it's not brand new
I'll take this secondhand heart
And give it to you
I'll take my secondhand heart
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
So if you don't mind
That it's not brand new
I'll take this secondhand heart
And give it to you


They say this town
The stars stay up all night
Don't know can't see them
For the glow of the neon lights
And it's a long way from here
To the place where the home fires burn
Well it's 2,000 miles and one left turn


Dear Mom and Dad
Please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
I don't need much just enough to get me through
Please don't worry because I'm alright
(I'm playing here at the bar tonight)
This time I'm going to make our dreams come true
Well I love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl


Black top blue sky
Big town full of little white lies
Everybody's your friend you can never be sure
They'll promise fancy cars and diamond rings
All sorts of shiny things
Girl, you'll remember what your knees are for


Dear Mom and Dad
Please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
I don't need much just enough to get me through
Please don't worry because I'm alright
(I'm playing here at the bar tonight)
This time I'm going to make our dreams come true
Well I love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl


I know that I'm on my way
When I can tell every time I play
And I know it's worth all the dues I pay
When I can write to you and say


Dear Mom and Dad
I'll send money
I'm so rich that it ain't funny
Well it ought to be more then enough to get you through
Please don't worry because I'm alright
I'm stayin here at the Ritz tonight
What do you know we made our dreams come true!
And there are fancy cars and diamond rings
But you know that they don't mean a thing
Well they all add up to nothing compared to you
Well, remember me in ribbons and curls
I still love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl


Your baby girl
Your baby girl
Dear Mom and Dad
Please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Don't need much just enough to get me through
Please don't worry because I'm alright
I'm playin here at the bar tonight
Dreams come true


She said she loved me all night long
I couldn't help but let her string my heart along
I knew better, I still do, but I'm not the first man
Who's ever played the fool


So tell me, why do I keep holding on?
Oh, why do I keep staring down the barrel of a loaded gun?
Tell me, why can't I just let go?
Somebody knows, then tell me


I won't point the finger but I'll take the blame
Because I saw her coming from a million miles away
I should've fought the feeling but I gave in
Because those lying blue eyes kept on pulling me back in




Oh, why can't you just tell me if you know?


Maybe you were right, maybe I could have changed
Sitting here alone tonight thinking 'bout a lot of things
What's a man to say when all the questions start
Hell I know deep down inside my broken heart


Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway


I hate it when it's like this, baby it's like that now
Nothing I can say to you, you even care to talk about
How you going to dress it up, wrap it in a pretty bow
When it's gone, it's gone for good, baby at least I know


Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway


Let the world revolve around you
And given you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway


If you don't take me to Paris
On a lover's getaway
It's all right
It's all right
If I'd rather wear your T-shirt
Than a sexy negligee
It's all right
It's all right
Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit
It's kinda nice to know that it doesn't have to be


Perfect
Baby every little piece
Of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges
Tattered at the seams
But honey if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me


If your mother doesn't like
The way I treat her baby boy
It's all right
It's all right
If in every wedding picture
My daddy looks annoyed
It's all right
It's all right
Don't you know that fairy tales tell a lie
Real love and real life doesn't have to be




You don't mind if I show up late for everything
And when you lose your cool It's kinda cute to me
Ain't it nice to know that we don't have to be




It's good enough for me(perfect)
Yeah good enough for me(perfect)
Good enough for me(perfect)

Well, I just got back from a lovely trip
Along the Milky Way
I stopped off at the North Pole
To spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me in his workshop
And told his plans to me
So you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's makin' a list and checkin' it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Little tin horns, little toy drums
Rudy-toot-toot and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is coming to town
Little toy dolls that cuddle and coo
Elephants, boats and Kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is coming to town
The kids in Girl and Boy Land
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy land
All around the Christmas tree
Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming, Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa's coming, watch out
So you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm tellin' you why


I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run


Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man


I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I’ll always be around
You push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run


Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man


I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can’t say that
You can’t say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would’ve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah


Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man


We might still be in love, if you were a better man
Better man


From the moment that we met
My world was turned around
Upside down
To some degree I still regret
My memory for keeping you around
Girl I thought that you were mine
But my broken hearts been shattered
One too many times


And I don't want to see you anymore
I'm just not that strong
I love it when you're here
But I'm better when you're gone
I'm certain that I've given and oh how you can take
There's no use in you looking
There's nothing left for you to break
Baby please release me
Let my heart rest in pieces


Someone let you down again
So you turn to me
Your convenient friend
Oh but I know what you're doing
And what you hope to find
I've seen it a thousand times
Oh the fire we had before
Are now just bitter ashes
Left scattered on the floor



When the devil's knocking at my door
When I'm broken and I'm battle worn
Down in the valley, on my knees
Yea she's, yea she's with me

Ain't she amazing, amazing, out of my league?
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me

When my dreams are running out of road
And the world around me's turning cold
Anyone else would up and leave
But she's, yea she's with me

Ain't she amazing, amazing, out of my league?
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me

Top of the mountain and all the way down
When I'm lost and when I'm found
In the day, in the light, in the dark of the night
When it all goes wrong, when it all goes right
Whoa oh, I don't know what I'd do without her
Whoa oh, she's gotta know I'm all about her

She's amazing, amazing
Ain't she amazing, amazing?

Ain't she amazing, amazing, out of my league?
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me

Ain't she amazing, amazing? (That girl, she's out of my league)
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me
That she's, yea she's with me

Top of the mountain and all the way down
When I'm lost and when I'm found
In the day, in the light, in the dark of the night
When it all goes wrong, when it all goes right
Top of the mountain and all the way down
When I'm lost and when I'm found
In the day, in the light, in the dark of the night
When it all goes wrong, when it all goes right

Hey there honey, in your cut up jeans
Whatcha drinkin' I was thinkin' you could save a sip for me
I've been lookin' cross the party all night long
At you movin' your hips with your pretty lips singin' along to a country song
Climb on up here with me
In my truck cause if we
Don't go ridin' around
I'm gonna run my battery down so

If you're ready to roll girl, just let me know girl
I don't know who brought you here and he left you alone
But he ain't worth the time you're spendin'
Textin' him on the phone girl
It's time to move on girl
I got a radio and a shotgun seat
And it's gettin' late
It's time for me to take you home girl

It's alright if you live way out
I got enough gas to take you all over this town yeah
When we pull in the drive, I'll walk you up to the door
I'm a good guy girl, I'll settle for a kiss on the porch unless you want one more
Now he ain't payin' no attention
Don't know what he's missin'
So baby what do ya say
Why don't you just walk this way

When you're ready to roll girl
Just let me know girl
I don't know who brought you here and he left you alone
But he ain't worth the time you're spending textin' him on the phone
It's time to move on girl
I got a radio and a shotgun seat
And it's getting late
It's time to take you home girl

Come on let's go girl

So when you're ready to roll girl
We can take it nice and slow girl
Might even find a place to park
Sit there and watch the stars
Put on a show girl
Hey I don't know girl
I got a radio and a shotgun seat
And it's getting late
It's time for me to take you home girl
You can be my home girl

I was minding my own business
Enjoying the party
Making my rounds
One look
You shook me out of my senses
Knock me to the ground
Heart fall down

Like a rock in a river
Shock and a shiver
Running right down my spine
So dizzy and dazed
Completley amazed
Falling in record time

And all you did was walk into the room
Heart fall down
Go boom

Sounded like a big explosion
Felt like an earhquake
Inside and out
Hit so hard
No wonder I'm shaking
Knock me to the ground
Heart fall down

Like a rock in a river
Shock and a shiver
Runnin' right down my spine
So dizzy and dazed
Completley amazed
Falling in record time

And all you did was walk into the room
Heart fall down
Go boom

Flash of lightning
Crash of thunder
Helpless
Breathless
Going under

Like a rock in a river
Shock and a shiver
Running right down my spine
So dizzy and dazed
Completley amazed
Fallin' in record time

Can You Guess The Song By The Emojis?

And all you did was walk into the room
Heart fall down, go
Heart fall down
Go boom

Oh, heart fall down, go
(Like a rock in a river)
Shock and a shiver
So dizzy and dazed
Completely amazed

Oh, heart fall down
Go boom
(Like a rock in a river
Shock and a shiver)
So dizzy and dazed
Compleley amazed

Oh, heart fall down
Go boom
(Like a rock in a river
Shock and a shiver)
So dizzy and dazed
Compleley amazed


Two hearts, two bucket seats, too much sun not to wear shades
Boot to the pedal and pedal to the metal, we're the reason this road was paved, yeah
Now, honey, how fast you wanna go? NASCAR driving, Miss Daisy?
Radio loud, radio low, or I can sing if you want me to baby


I can tell God's smiling down, I just get that feeling
You and me going town to town, on two lanes of freedom


Oh, no red lights or stop signs around for miles
Just swaying trees, your hair in the breeze, and that smile, and I know
God made old country roads for driving and dreaming
Mine's coming true, girl, here with you on two lanes of freedom
Two lanes of freedom


Bottle of wine and a cheap motel, door twelve feet from the road
Watch the sunset holding hands and talk about where we're gonna go
So where you wanna go? (Where you wanna go?)
Where you wanna go? (Where you wanna go?)
Where you wanna go? (Where you wanna go?)
Where you wanna go? (Where you wanna go?)


Babe, there's no red lights or stop signs around for miles
Just swaying trees, your hair in the breeze, and that smile, and I know
God's working down from that sky blue ceiling
He made these old country roads for driving and dreaming
Mine's coming true, girl, here with you on two lanes of freedom
Two lanes of freedom
Two lanes of freedom
Two lanes of freedom


(Two lanes of freedom)
(Two lanes of freedom)
(Two lanes of freedom)
(Two lanes of freedom)
(Two lanes of freedom)

Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say

From the land where palm trees sway

Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright
The sun will shine by day and all the stars at night

To say Merry Christmas to you

She wore a dress with cherries on it
Going somewhere where she'd be wanted
In a town this small all they do is talk
No wedding ring, chipped fingernail polish

She always wished that she could go to college
But some dreams fade
They just slip away
She started to show a few months ago
And she had to go
That's how she wound up


On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Head hung down with the windows up
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace
But she fell in love
She fell in love
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus


The moon was full
The stars were smiling
God has a funny sense of timing
The baby came on the interstate
Somewhere between Jackson and Memphis

She finally found what she had been missing
She cried and laughed while the red lights flashed
Sweet baby girl
She looked into the face of a new
The face of a brand new world


On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Heart so full that it could bust
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace

But she fell in love
She fell in love
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Sweet baby girl, she found a brand new world

On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Heart so full that it could bust
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace

But she fell in love
She fell in love
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Sweet baby girl
She found a brand new world


She wore a dress with cherries on it
Going somewhere where she'd be wanted


Haven't seen you since high school
Good to see you're still beautiful
Gravity hasn't started to pull
Quite yet I bet you're rich as hell
One that's five and one that's three
Been two years since he left me
Good to know that you got free
That town I know was keeping you down on your knees


These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses, we all got bruises
We all got bruises


Have you seen him? Not in years
How about her? No, but I hear
She's in Queens with the man of her dreams
Funny back then she said that about you
Que sera, you'll never guess who I saw
Remember Johnny B?
Remember him we were best friends, practically
Let's do this soon again, ten years is that what it's been?
Can't believe how time flies by
Leaving you makes me wanna cry


These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses, we all got bruises
We all got bruises


I would love to fix it all for you
I would love to fix you too
Please don't fix a thing whatever you do


These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to know you've got a friend
But you remember now and then
Everybody loses


These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses
Everybody loses
Everybody loses
We all got bruises
We all got bruises
We all got bruises


The radio and a sundress
Making my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and the truth spilled
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of "Night Moves"


I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna


I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart
(pourin' out your heart)
When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home


Let me be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna


When you're searching the horizon (searching the horizon)
When your eyes look back
When you're standing in the moment
Every life has a soundtrack


Oh I wanna be, I wanna be, oh I wanna be
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song


When the highway's calling
When the bottle's dry
When the sky is falling and you're asking yourself why
Oh, oh, I wanna be,(wanna be,wanna be) yeah, oh

Turn on the TV
More crime in the streets
More trouble in the middle east
And fires out west

Politicians slingin dirt
Got descension in the church
Another law suit in the works
Man you talk about a mess
Too much tension between miss liberty and the eiffel tower
Its about time we all made up at some big happy hour

I think the world needs a drink
I think enoughs enough
Shes been spinnin around so long i think she's pretty wound up
Calm down, sit back, relax
Tear up the contracts and save the ink
Yeah I think the world needs a drink
I bet we'd get somethin done
Over 2 for ones
Rubbin elbows with the big guns
Wouldn't that be cool?

Call all the rich and the poor
The peace keepers and the warlords
We'll cut some deals over nothing more
Than a shot of 90 proof

There ain't nothin wrong a few cold beers can't iron out
In fact you tell me just when and where and I'll buy the first round
I think the world needs a drink
I think enoughs enough
Shes been spinnin around so long I'd say she's pretty wound up
Let's all calm down sit back relax
Tear up the contracts and save the ink
Yeah I think the world needs a drink
Whoo!
(Instrumental)
Hey let's all calm down sit back relax
Tear up the contracts and save the ink
Yeah I think the world needs
Dont you think the world needs a couple drinks
I know I do
Yeah thats right

On a greyhound bus, Lord I'm traveling this morning
I'm going to Shreveport and down to New Orleans
Been driving these highways, been doing things my way
It's been making me lonesome on'ry and mean
Now her hair was jet black, and her name was Codene
Thought she was the cream of the Basin Street queens
She got tired of that smokey whine dream
Began to feel lonesome on'ry and mean

And we got together, and we cashed in our sweeps
Gave them to a beggar who was mumbling through the streets
There's no escaping from his snowy white dreams
Born lookin' lonesome on'ry and mean
Now I'm down in this valley, where the wheels turn so low
At dawn I pray, to the Lord of my soul
I say do Lord, do right by me
I'm tired of being lonesome on'ry and mean
'Od da la de oooooo'

This belly button dangle
Will probably be just one of those things
I won't be showing off too often at 65
This butterfly tattoo
Might be something I tell my kids not too do
Spring break shouldn't last the rest of your life

There were things I should not have of done
But then again, well I sure had fun

Being free, being wild, being bulletproof
Back then we were rebels without a clue
Nothing in the world that we wouldn't do
Woah oh oh oh oh
Didn't give a damn what people say
We were doing it, doing it our way
I wish that we could always stay
19 and crazy

I fall in love with those guys
That keep my dad awake at night
Running his knife across a red stone
Maybe he hates their long hair
The tattoos or the chains that they all wear
Mostly he hates your black camero

We were young, so in love
And we still haven't grown up

Being free, being wild, being bulletproof
Back then we were rebels without a clue
Nothing in the world that we wouldn't do
Woah oh oh oh oh
Didn't give a damn what people say
We were doing it, doing it our way
I wish we could always stay
19 and crazy

The only things that I regret are things that we didn't do
Those crazy days that I have left
Have led me here to you

Being free, being wild, being bulletproof
Right now we're rebels without a clue
Nothing in the world that we can't do
Woah oh oh oh oh
Don't give a damn what people say
Cause we're doing it, doing it our way
I know that we will always stay
19 and crazy

Promise me we will always stay


It was one of those times what a real good time felt like a long time ago
It was one of those fires that burned all night and made your blue jeans smell like smoke
Hanging with friends, going against our upbringing, smokin' and drinkin'
It was one of those girls and one of those guys who didn't know quite what to do
We were going along with what was going on saying I think I love you
And I think about us now every time that I go out, smokin' and drinkin'


Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gotcha' thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'


We be lighting up saying this town sucks so we painted on the bridge
We were young in love to not know enough that those were the days that we were going to miss
But damn we know it now cause that's all we talk about, smokin' and drinkin'


Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gotcha' thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'
Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gotcha' thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'


Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' got cha thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights when all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah
Smokin' and drinkin'
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah
Smokin' and drinkin'

You said: "Eight o'clock an' don't be late."
I said: "I won't: I just can't wait."
Nine-fifteen, I'm wonderin' where you're at
Hey, baby, what's up with that?

Pedro, my friend, dropped in at ten
"Como esta. Muy buen."
He said he saw you kiss a boy down at the laundry-mat
Now, mes amigo, what's up with that?

Girl, what's goin' on?
Why would you be out lookin' around
When last night, we had somethin' cookin'?
You swore you'd be my baby
And I'd forever be your baby too
That's why I thought you'd never leave me hangin'
An' stuck on this bar stool cross-eyed
Singin' the blues to a bartender girl
In a cowboy hat:
Baby, what's up with that?

Where could you be? It's almost twelve
I left a message on your shelf
One-thirty-five, still ain't heard back
Now could you tell me what's up with that?

It's closing time, I leave alone
Drive by your house but you're not home
All night long, wonderin' where you're at
Hey, baby, what's up with that?

Girl, what's goin' on?
Why would you be out lookin' around
When last night, we had somethin' cookin'?
You swore you'd be my baby
And I'd forever be your baby too
That's why I thought you'd never leave me hangin'
An' stuck on this bar stool cross-eyed
Singin' the blues to a bartender girl
In a cowboy hat:
Baby, what's up with that?

Oh, yeah, yeah:
Oh, baby, what's up with that?


In my daughter's eyes I am a hero
I am strong and wise and I know no fear
But the truth is plain to see
She was sent to rescue me
I see who I want to be
In my daughter's eyes
In my daughter's eyes everyone is equal
Darkness turns to light and the
World is at peace
This miracle God gave to me
Gives me strength when I am weak
I find reason to believe
In my daughter's eyes
And when she wraps her hand around my finger
Oh it puts a smile in my heart
Everything becomes a little clearer
I realize what life is all about
It's hanging on when your heart has had enough
It's giving more when you feel like giving up
I've seen the light
It's in my daughter's eyes
In my daughter's eyes I can see the future
A reflection of who I am and what will be
Though she'll grow and someday leave
Maybe raise a family
When I'm gone I hope you see
How happy she made me
For I'll be there
In my daughter's eyes

Now, baby, pull the covers back over my head
I don't want to get it up outta this bed
I don't wanna drag it on off to work
That big boss man is really a flirt
We've been lovin' all night
Just about settin' me everything right
Hope it don't get me
I'm gonna live it just as long as I can
I'm gonna make it every part of my plan
Lovin' all night, hangin' on tight
No doubt about it, been lovin' all night

Well, you tell me I'm as pretty as a fresh cut flower
When you show me how you love me in the wee small hours
While everybody's sleeping on around this town
Lovin' all night makes the world go 'round

We've been lovin' all night
Just about hittin' me everything right
Hope it don't get me
I'm gonna live it just as long as I can
I'm gonna make it every part of my plan
Lovin' all night, hangin' on tight
No doubt about it, been lovin' all night

Ain't no use talkin' when you're looking so fine;
When you move your body up a-close to mine
We've been rocking with the rhythm of a beat of our own
Baby, I'm gonna love you 'till the cows come home

We've been lovin' all night
Just about hittin' me everything right
Hope it don't get me
I'm gonna live it just as long as I can
I'm gonna make it every part of my plan
Lovin' all night, feelin' all right
No doubt about it, been lovin' all night

We've been lovin' all night, hangin on tight
Good God almighty, been loving all night, yeah
Mmmmm, been lovin' all night
Been lovin' all night
Lovin' all night, yeah
Lovin' all night
Been lovin' all night
Memmmm. hey, ahh been lovin' all night


I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face and I've
Never been this swept away


All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart


'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
Suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe


In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
I'm closer than I've ever felt before
And I know
And you know
There's no need for words right now


'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
Suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe


Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe


I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way

I blew out all my plans
The world fell in my hands
The day that I began
Trying to love you

The secrets I have kept
The nights I haven't slept
I've laughed until I've wept
Trying to love you

Trying to love you
No one's come as close or gone so far
Trying to love you
I've lost and found myself in who you are
Trying to love you
So easy and so hard
Trying to love you

I've watched myself get stuck
I've squandered all my luck
I've almost given up
Trying to love you

Trying to love you
It broke my heart
It's chipped away my pride
Trying to love you
Every time I'd see that fault line slide
Trying to love you
I've crossed the great divide
Trying to love you

Trying to love you
I've screamed your name
I've slammed a thousand doors
Trying to love you
And I've worn a million miles across the floor
Trying to love you
Still I could not ignore
Trying to love you

It's pulled the best from me
For all the world to see
I guess I'll always be
Trying to love you

I heard it through the grapevine
My new neighbor don't like my big red barn
A '47 Ford, bullet holes in the door
Broke down motor in the front yard
I got half a mind to paint a plywood sign
And nail it up on a knotty pine tree
Saying I was here first
This is my piece of dirt
And your rambling don't rattle me

Some people care about what other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
Saying blah, blah, blah, just a jacking their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back
I don't give a dern what other people think
What do ya think about that

I wear what I want to, overalls, work boots
Crank my music up loud
Like to sling a little mud in my four wheel drive
Trek it all into town

Shot a little eight ball down at the pool hall
Drink a beer with my friends
Now don't judge me and I won't judge you
Cause we all get judged in the end

Some people care about what other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
Saying blah, blah, blah, just a jacking their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back
I don't give a dern what other people think
What do ya think about that

Some people care about what other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
Saying blah, blah, blah, just a jacking their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back
I don't give a dern what other people think
What do ya think about that

Say, I don't give a damn what other people think
What do ya think about that
What do ya think about that

I know we talked about going out tonight
But baby, if it's alright with you
I'd just sooner we crack open a bottle of wine
And stay right here all night through

We can kiss on the couch, dance in the kitchen
Sit on the porch, listen to the crickets
Sing us a song and all our worries away

And a little later on when the wine starts working
Call it a night, close all the curtains
Come on baby, I can hardly wait
To go to bed early and stay up late

Who needs the candles at that fancy restaurant
When we can stay right here and light our own
And that rocking band downtown won't even cross your mind
When I put a little Otis Redding on

We can kiss on the couch, dance in the kitchen
Sit on the porch, listen to the crickets
Sing us a song and all our worries away

Then a little later on when the wine starts working
Call it a night, close all the curtains
Come on baby, I can hardly wait
To go to bed early and stay up late

We can kiss on the couch, dance in the kitchen
Sit on the porch, listen to the crickets
Sing us a song and all our worries away

Then a little later on when the wine starts working
Call it a night, close all the curtains
Come on baby, I can hardly wait
To go to bed early and stay up late

Stay up late
Stay up late


When I was ten years old
I remember thinking how cool it would be
When we were going on an eight hour drive
If I could just watch TV

And I'd have given anything
To have my own PacMan game at home
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade
Now I've got it on my phone


He-e-ey
Glory glory hallelujah
Welcome to the future


My grandpa was in World War II
He fought against the Japanese
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma
Mailed them from his base in the Philippines

I wish they could see this now
Where they say this change can go
Cause I was on a video chat this morning
With a company in Tokyo


He-e-ey
Every day is a revolution
Welcome to the future

He-e-ey
Look around it's all so clear
He-e-ey
Wherever we would go and well we
He-e-ey
So many things I never thought I'd see
Happening right in front of me


I had a friend in school
Running-back on a football team
They burned a cross in his front yard
For asking out the home-coming queen

I thought about him today
Everybody who's seen what he's seen
From a woman on a bus
To a man with a dream


He-e-ey
Wake up Martin Luther
Welcome to the future
He-e-ey
Glory glory hallelujah
Welcome to the future

Lookin' at you through a misty moonlight
Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swayin' like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through the willow tree

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer nights beauty took my breath away

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Every night now once I've been back home
I lie awake at night drifting in my memory
I think about you on your momma's front porch swing
Talking that way so soft to me

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
You know it sure felt right

I like my heroes
To be honest and strong
I wear t-shirts
And blue jeans
I try to understand
All the cultures of this world
I'm an American from the Midwest

When I speak
I have a southern drawl
I mind my manners most of the time
When you come down here
Stop and stay hello
I'm an American from south of the Mason Dixon line

I'm an American, I'm an American
I respect you and your point of view
I'm an American, I'm an American
And I wish you good luck with whatever you do

I start my day
And I'm ready to work
I'm responsible
And I like to get things done
If you ever need some help
Come and look my way
'Cause I try to be here for everyone

I'm an American, I'm an American
I respect you and your point of view
I'm an American, I'm an American
And I wish you good luck with whatever you do

They call me the land of opportunity
With our agriculture
And beautiful movie stars
We can turn our dreams
Into a way of life
So be happy and be who you are

I'm an American, I'm an American
I respect you and your point of view
I'm an American, I'm an American
And I wish you good luck with whatever you do

(Jessica Andrews)
If I live to be a hundred
And never see the seven wonders
That'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a Grammy
I'm gonna be just fine
'Cause I know exactly who I am
I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends who love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am
So when I make big mistake
When I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be alright
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowin'
I will be just fine
'Cause nothin' changes who I am
I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends who love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am
I'm a saint and I'm a sinner
I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm am steady and unstable
I am young but I'm able
I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends who love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am
I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends who love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

Finally kept my pride
And hailed a cab

Those cuttin' words you said

Were the last stab

There'll be no tears this time
They've all dried up

No more sweet poison
I already drank that cup
This tunnel's dark
But there's a little light glowing

Bright enough for me to run toward knowing
Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
No pain this life will put me through
Will ever ever hurt like you

Don't need a miracle
A superhero
There's only one way up
When you're at zero
You took my innocence
But it was knowing
No I don't need you
And that made me a woman
I paid my dues
But that's a debt I'm done paying
I'm standing strong
But I'm still on my knees praying

Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
No pain this life will put me through
Will ever ever hurt like you


Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite


Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
(Do you hear what I hear)
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
(Do hear what I hear)
A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea


Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
(Do you know what I know)


In your palace warm mighty king
Do you know what I know
(Do you know what I know)
A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold


Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
( Listen to what I say)
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
(Listen to what I say)
The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light


He will bring us goodness and light


When I think back on these times
And the dreams we left behind
I'll be glad cause I was blessed to get
To have you in my life
When I look back on these days
I'll look and see your face
You were right there for me...


In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am ,there you'll be


Well, you showed me how it feels
To feel the sky within my reach
And I always will remember all
The strength you gave to me
Your love made me make it through
Oh, I owe so much to you
You were right there for me


In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am ,there you'll be


Cause I always saw in you
My light, my strength
And I want to thank you now
For all the ways
You were right there for me
You were right there for me
For always


In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am ,there you'll be


There you'll be...


He's a twenty-years-straight-get-to-work-on-time
He's a love-one-woman-for-all-his-life
He's a shirt-off-his-back, give-you-his-last-dime
He's strong


He's a need-to-move-somethin'?-you-can-use-my-truck
He's an overtime worker when the bills pile up
Everybody knows he ain't just tough
He's strong, strong


He'll pick you up and won't let you down
Rock solid inside out
Somebody you can trust
Steady as the sun
Ain't nothin' gonna knock him off the road he's rollin on
He's strong


It ain't what he can carry or what he can lift
It's a dirt road lesson talkin' to his kids
'Bout how to hold your ground and how to live strong
He's strong


He'll pick you up and won't let you down
Rock solid inside out
Somebody you can trust
Steady as the sun
Ain't nothin' gonna knock him off the road he's rollin on
He's strong


Strong
Like the river rollin'
Strong
Gonna keep on goin'
Strong
When the road runs out
They gonna keep on talkin' about
How he was strong
Strong


He'll pick you up and won't let you down
Rock solid inside out
Somebody you can trust
Steady as the sun
Ain't nothin' gonna knock him off the road he's rollin on
He's strong


Everybody knows he ain't just tough
He's strong

I might get drunk and rob a bank
Shoot my car if it don't crank
Try to raise a little Cain
Mess the walls up with some paint
Might even join a rodeo
Ride my horse to Buffalo
Change my name to Bill -
I don't think I ever will
But I can't promise you I won't
Some people do, some people don't
Some people win, some people lose
Some people never get to choose
All you can do is the best you can
And hope things work out like you plan
I plan to stay but I might go
I can't say cause I don't know

I might become the president
And tell the world I'm heaven sent
Take up drinking cold iced tea
Quit watching women and tv
Might even smoke those cigarettes
Play my guitar like Dickey Betts
Get in miss Shania's pants -
I don't think I've got a chance
But I ain't sayin' I won't try
To do it all before I die
I just might win, but if I lose
Well I'll just blame it on the booze
Cause I'm just doin the best I can
And I hope ya understand
I plan to stay, but I might go
And if I do, I told you so

Catching Babe Ruth, catching Roger Maris
The way you caught my eye in Parris...Tennessee

Selling seduction, well I'm seduced
We sell a war then we sell a truce
It's the truth

Baby just close your eyes
Nothin' catches Jesus by surprise

Confusing love for heated passion
Got what I wanted but no satisfaction

Ain't it funny how things can change
We're amazed how they stay the same
Oh, it's the same

Baby just close your eyes
Nothin' catches Jesus by surprise

You look so pretty when you smile
I haven't seen that for a while

Talk about trouble we've had our share
It's a wonder we're still here

I don't know why I make you cry
It's the part of me I don't like at all

Baby just close your eyes
Nothin' catches Jesus by surprise

Baby just close your eyes
Nothin' catches Jesus by surprise

Turn the light off, go to bed
Tell me all about the day you had
Lay beside me, it's time to rest
You can close your eyes, you've done your best

Let me be your sanctuary
Let me be your safe place to fall
I can take away your worries
The refuge from it all

All this time
We have together
Is our shelter from the rain
I will share the weight you carry
Let me be your sanctuary

We have weathered through the storms
Taking comfort in each other's arms
When the dark clouds come again
I will lift you up and take you in

Let me be your sanctuary
Let me be your safe place to fall
I can take away your worries
The refuge from it all

Oh, this time
We have together
Is our shelter from the rain
I will share the weight you carry
Let me be your sanctuary

I will share this weight you carry
Let me be your sanctuary


Lately I have been working overtime
You've been taking a class at night
Even though we've got bills still left to pay
I think we should just slip away


I can see you in the sun
Sippin' on that Coke and rum
Come on, girl lets take a ride!


Rolling through the sunshine
You right here by my side
Wind Surfin in the Wind
On a wave that never ends
Ain't no chance of rain
Just good times on the way
Tom Petty on the Radio
Free Fallin' as we go


We can leave it all behind
Go rolling through the sunshine


Grab you sunglasses
I'll grab my guitar
The nearest beach can't be that far
Say goodbye to your stress and your cell phone
We can put the whole world on hold


I can see you in the sun
Sippin on that Coke and rum
Come on, girl lets take a ride!


Go rolling through the sunshine
You right here by my side
Wind Surfin' in the wind
On a wave that never ends
Ain't no chance of rain
Just good times on the way
Tom Petty on the radio
Free Fallin' as we go


We can leave it all behind
Go rolling through the sunshine


I can see you in the sun
Sippin' on that Coke and rum
Come on, girl lets take a ride!


Rolling through the sunshine
You right here by my side
Wind surfin in the wind
On a wave that never ends
Ain't no chance of rain
Just good times on the way
Tom Petty on the radio
Free Fallin' as we go
We can leave it all behind

(Travis Tritt)

I know there's times
You've been tormented by the questions in your mind
Will our love last
Or simply fade away as time begins to pass
You're a complicated lady that's for sure
With a need for someone unafraid to make you feel secure
And if you wonder if I'm strong enough to be your man
Yes,I am
Yes,I am

Don't let yourself imagine it's a lie
I'm not the kind to turn and say goodbye
And though you test my soul
And make yourself so hard to hold

I'm gonna make you understand
I'm strong enough to be your man

Do you believe
When I look in your eyes and swear
I'll never leave
What will it take
To make you know that what we have is here to stay
Yes,I know that you've been loved and left before
But I promise you won't ever see me walking out the door
And if you wonder if I'm strong enough to your man
Yes,I am
Yes,I am


I got my one strap snapped on my Liberty Bibs
Wad of Levi Garrett packed between my lip and my gum
Merica
Got mud kickin' off of my Red Wing boots
Sweat stained tank top in my Fruit of the Looms
Keep it tucked
Merica


We're back to back undefeated world war champs
So take a cup, raise it up for my Uncle Sam
You know we sent a man to the moon
And before we're done
Yeah we'll probably send a man to the sun
Merica


Got a 12 gauge Remington on my gun rack
Stars and stripes flying high off the back of my truck
Course it's 4x4
Merica
Buck antlers, Colonel Sanders, General Lee
Home of the brave and land of that Yee Yee
And country girls
Merica


We're back to back undefeated world war champs
So take a cup, raise it up for my Uncle Sam
You know we sent a man to the moon
And before we're done
Yeah we'll probably send a man to the sun
Merica

Buck. Truck. Chuck. Norris


I pledge allegiance to the flag of Merica
I crack a cold one and tip it on back to Merica
I got a right to bare arms for my barbed wire tat Merica
I'm gonna warn ya if you try to attack Merica


That we're back to back undefeated world war champs
So take a cup, raise it up to my Uncle Sam
There's about a zillion reasons to love where I'm from
But all you really gonna need is one
Merica

My friends call me up cause they know I'm down
Take me out to paint the town and help me get over it
Pretty blonde girl at the end of the bar
Buys a drink, gives a wink, and then it goes too far
We're out on the dance floor feelin' the gin
I finally start coming alive again
I take her home for the night
And everything is right until the first ray of sunlight
And damn if I don't wake up lovin' you

Oh I wake up lovin' you

Thought if I could catch a plane, touch down, out of town
Somewhere nobody knows you
Maybe I could give myself half of a chance
To get a life and act a like a different man
But my best of intentions were all shot to hell
And I found myself hiding in a cheap hotel
Drownin' in the whiskey, starin' at the T.V., tryin' not to sleep
Cause I'm just gonna wake up lovin' you

Yeah I wake up lovin' you, yeah

Yeah I wake up lovin' you
Yeah I wake up lovin' you

Remember when I told you I was never going to stop
Lovin' you with all my heart and soul no matter what
Now it seems I'm breaking every promise that I made
Cause every night I'm desperate
Askin' God if He would just let me forget it
But I wake up lovin' you

I wake up lovin' you

I wake up lovin' you, yeah
I wake up lovin' you, yeah
I wake up lovin' you, oh
I wake up lovin' you
I wake up lovin' you
I wake up lovin' you

Sometimes it's a car
A certain shade of mystic blue
I think of you and I wonder how on Earth you are
Sometimes just a song
That's playing on my radio
And there I go just a wishin' you were singin' along

That's all it takes
And I just opt to dreamin' I'm in

*Chorus*
Way Back Texas
You were layin' in my arms
That class ring necklace
We're gonna buy that little farm
Way down by the river
Yeah raise a family
Down in way back Texas
Uhuh population you and me

Me I'm doing well
No one in particular
Girl i heard that you went and rang them weddin' bells
The say his name is John
His daddy owns a dealership
But the slipper don't quite fit
Yet life goes on and on
So I guess that I'll hang up
And just wonder if you ever dream of

*Chorus*
Way Back Texas
Were you layin' in my arms
Had a class ring necklace
We're gonna buy that little farm
Way down by the river
Yeah livin' happily
Down in way back texas
Way back
Population you and me

And every now and then
If you need me I'll be back in

*Chorus*
Way Back Texas
Where your layin' in my arms
Had a class ring necklace
We're gonna buy that little farm
Way down by the river
Yeah raise a family
Down in way back Texas
Uhuh population you and me

Nothing like a little thunder, telling us good morning
Don't you just love that tin roof when it's storming
Makes me wanna lay here and just do whatever
Pull up the covers and hang out under the weather
It's cat and doggin', something crazy
Girl we oughta just keep it lazy
Baby, baby

I don't really care if the sun don't shine
It's a little more time for us to have
From the outside world, you and me girl
We've got all we need, tangled up in sheets
So, why not stay in the same spot
Until the rain stops

I think we better do, what mother nature tells us
You know those windows they ain't gonna fog themselves up
Ain't no blue sky, on that horizon
But I bet you we can find us a silver linen
Girl the rain drops, they got their own little rhythm
So let's move with them

I don't really care if the sun don't shine
It's a little more time for us to have
From the outside world, you and me girl
We've got all we need, tangled up in sheets
So, why not stay in the same spot
Until the rain stops

We can lay low, breathe easy
And just go with the flow

Oh baby, baby

I don't really care if the sun don't shine
It's a little more time for us to have
From the outside world, you and me girl
We've got all we need, tangled up in sheets
So, why not stay in the same spot
Oh baby, why not stay in the same spot
Until the rain stops
Until the rain stops
Oh baby, baby
Until the rain stops


You boys ever met a real country girl
Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down home, country girl


She's a hot little number in her pickup truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all


Country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Brother, she's country


A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from the holler in Kentucky
Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother, she's all


Country, (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Nothin' but country


(Thick southern drawl)
(Sexy swing and walk)
(Aw, show 'em how a country girl does it one time now)




Brother, she's country
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothin' but country
Yeah, yeah-ah
She's country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain't afraid to stay
Country
Yeah, she's nothin' but country


She's all about the country
From the backwoods, she's a homegrown, down to the bone
She's country


Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do


And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again


You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do


But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again


And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past


'Cause you threw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again


But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

When I lay my head on my pillow at night
The woman I love is holding me tight
I must believe I'm doing something right
Well, it's one more day livin' in paradise

I probably ought to say my prayers a little more often than I do
I call myself too busy and that's really no excuse
But the Lord keeps on forgiving me, I don't know what He's thinking
Every day He blesses me He reaches out and keeps me breathing

'Cause when I lay my head on my pillow at night
The woman I love is holding me tight
I must believe I'm doing something right
Well, it's one more day livin' in paradise

I ran off to the beach and I married a girl
Both of us starting out in this great big world
She's always doing wonderful and I'm damn lucky to have her
To remind me of everything in this life that really matters

Oh, when I lay my head on my pillow at night
The woman I love is holding me tight
I must believe I'm doing something right
Well, it's one more day livin' in paradise

Lord, I got more than I deserve
Don't be surprised when you see me back in church

When I lay my head on my pillow at night
And the woman I love is holding me tight
I must believe I'm doing something right
Well, it's one more day

When I lay my head on my pillow at night
And the woman I love is holding me, holding me tight
I must believe I'm doing something right
Well, it's one more day livin' in, livin' in paradise
Ooh, livin' in paradise


Sitting with you in a dark room
Warmed by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope I say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?


There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives


I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter'd be Rose
Son, it'd be Ryan


There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives


I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're here by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old


Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping;
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm;
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm;
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow


Baby why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred fifteen channels
Of nothing but bad news on
Well, it might be me, but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Guess the little bitty living room ain't going to look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's going to be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beating
Nobody's going to see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?


Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?


Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
Those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already driving me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?


Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?


Well it might be me but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Oh baby, why don't we just dance?


Still runs good, built to last
Moves like a hula girl on the dash
She ain't made for practicality
Yeah, I guess she's just like me


It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll


Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes


Pop the top down like a summer dream
She's my teenage time machine
Just keeps getting sweeter with age
She's classic through any decade


The suns in the sky, glitter on the seats
You can try, but the Benz is hard to beat
So, hey, if you want you can ride with me, r-ride with me


Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes


It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll


Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

If regrets were like raindrops
There'd be a river running through this house
If our love was like a circus
I'd be the sad-faced clown

Walking with my head down
Wondering where you are now
Didn't I wrap my arms around you
Stare in your eyes and swear I loved you?

Didn't I, baby, didn't I
Give you everything you ever wanted?
Love you like crazy, let's be honest
Didn't I, baby, didn't I, didn't I?

I thought we were like a stone wall
Solid all the way around
I never knew you'd be the wrecking ball
To bring us tumbling down

Till I woke up that Friday morning
To find you gone, you were gone
Didn't I wrap my arms around you
Stare in your eyes and swear I loved you?

Didn't I, baby, didn't I
Give you everything you ever wanted?
Love you like crazy, let's be honest
Didn't I, baby, didn't I, didn't I?

Didn't I wrap my arms around you
Stare in your eyes and swear I loved you?

Oh baby, didn't I
Give you everything you ever wanted?
Love you like crazy, let's be honest
Didn't I, baby, didn't I?

Didn't I, baby, didn't I?
Oh baby didn't I?


(I'm feeling it)
Pop tops popping
Flip-flops flopping
Drop tops dropping down
Ray-Bans raying
Waves are waving
Ladies are laying out
Feeling it

IPods rocking
Sunblock blocking
Igloos stocking up (yep)
Cutoffs are cutting
Worry 'bout nothing
But putting something in my cup (feeling it)


And I can't, I can't find nothing wrong
With nothing, nothing that's going on
It's making me wanna sing a song
That goes like this


Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothing like feeling that summertime feeling
Kicked back, relaxed, just chilling
I'm feeling, I'm feeling it
Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothing like digging that summertime
Digging in the sand, getting tan
With your hand in my hand
I'm feeling it
Oh yeah, I'm feeling it


Rip tide ripping
Skim board skimming
Sip, sipping something on ice (fill it up)
Hot gets hotter
Head to the water
Jump into paradise (feeling it)




Sunset setting
Getting good's getting
Good as it can get
Lip gloss glossing
No more talking
Baby giving me a kiss
(Feeling it)




Pop tops popping
IPods rocking
Flip-flops flopping
Oh, I'm feeling it


You're making lists today of all the things you haven't done yet
You're driving everyone crazy, are you having any fun yet
Mother says you ought get married, shrink says here's a little blue pill
Too young for your mid-life crisis, mirror says you're over the hill


There's nothing wrong with you
The simple life gets complicated
There's nothing you can do
Just enjoy the view be glad you made it


You're making resolutions and it isn't even new year's
You could try a new religion, you could wait until the dust clears
Friends say you're way too choosy, shrink says see you next week
Guru says control your breathing you're afraid you might have peaked




Because things could be better
Because things could be worse
Because life can be charmed and cursed
There's fast, slow and stall, no reverse
You're making lists today of all the things you haven't done yet
You're driving everyone crazy, are you having any fun yet




This far
Oh, yeah


I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted


I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you


But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)


I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted


I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you


But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)


I thought I'd miss you
I thought it hurt me
And I'd wanna kiss you
I thought I'd miss you


But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
And I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)


Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine


Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane


Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house


But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane


Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside


Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane


I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
You'll never reach it
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
My faith is shaken


But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high


There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb


The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going


And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause...


There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb




There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb


Keep on moving
Keep climbing
Keep the faith, baby
It's all about, it's all about the climb
Keep the faith, keep your faith


Here we go!


You wear your smile like a summer sky
Just shining down on me and you
I swear your heart is a free bird
On a lazy Sunday afternoon
I love the way that you were up for anything
Never worried 'bout what people say
That's right, oh that's right
What we got is


Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're going to find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love
Mm that's our kind of love


Skipping rocks and leaving footprints
Down along the riverbank
Always holding hands, never making plans
Just living in the moment, babe
You get me laughing with those funny faces
You somehow always know just what to say
That's right, oh that's right
What we got is


Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're going to find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love
Mmm, that's our kind of love


Oh that's right, baby you and I
What we got is


Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're going to find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love
Mm that's our kind of love
Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're going to find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love
Mm that's our kind of love


Oh, that's our kind of love
Oh, that's our kind of love
1,2,3, here we go!
Oo, yeah
That's our kind of love, girl
Don't you know it

Well, I love her and she's leaving
She met a man, plays in a band last weekend
And he lives out on the west coast
And she says she's got to go

But it's a long, long way from Myrtle Beach to L.A
Anything could change her mind
One sunset or one regret
She could turn around, come back and be mine
Happy endings happen all the time

She's almost finished packing
There's over 2,000 miles, a lot could happen
There's going to be days and days of long stretches
Maybe she'll come back to her senses

Cause it's a long, long way from Myrtle Beach to L.A
Anything could change her mind
One sunset or one regret
And she could turn around, come back and be mine
Happy endings happen all the time

Well, I ain't waiting on no phone call
I ain't getting my hopes up at all
I ain't setting myself up for a fall

But it's still a long, long way from Myrtle Beach to L.A
Anything could change her mind
One sunset or one regret
She could turn around, come back and be mine
Then everything would be just fine
Yea, happy endings happen all the time

It's a long, long way from Myrtle Beach to L.A


I wish I could break your heart
I wish I could bring you down
Just for a second, teach you a lesson
About being alone in the dark
I wish I could make you cry
So hard you can barely breathe
And maybe you just might know what it feels like
Oh to be me


Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you, baby
But it'd be nice to know that I could
Be strong enough to pull you under
Throw you back a little thunder even though I never would
Oh, I wish I could break
I wish I could break your heart


I wish I could crash your dreams
I wish I could turn back time
Boy, I'd lead you on
Light the fuse, drop the bomb
Just so I'd be the first to leave


Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby
But it'd be nice to know that I could
Be strong enough to pull you under
Throw you back a little thunder even though I never would
Oh, I wish I could break
I wish I could break your heart
Your heart


I wish I could break your heart
I wish I could make you cry
I wish I could turn back time


Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby
But it'd be nice to know that I could
Be strong enough to pull you under
Throw you back a little thunder even though I never would
Oh, I wish I could break
I wish I could break your heart


All I can do is try to drink you in
And do my best
To soak up all that sugar from your skin
But then you had to go and kiss me
You made me fall a little bit harder in this
Said you gonna have to miss me
Oh, what do you got to do that for your lips


Pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste
Just a taste


I'd love to run my fingers through your hair
We could just pick up
Where we left off and start right there, hell I don't care
Oh, tell me what's your secret
Or how'd you get me going all crazy like this
And you got the touch and I needed
And I'm thinking you know that I can't resist your lips


Pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste


Now all I do
Is think about you all the time
But let me show you
That you never felt a love like mine
No you never felt a love like mine
All you left me was


Your lips pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste, yeah
Just a taste, yeah


Back in my mind all the time
Just a taste
So good oh that sugar from your skin
Oh, I gotta drink you in
Oh, let me drink you in
Just a taste

You look like Georgia on a cool summer day
Your smile hits me like a breeze blowin' off the lake
You talk like Kansas, you can see to the horizon
There's no place for the words to hide
'Cause you mean what you say, mean what you say

Got a heart like Indiana, laugh like Louisiana
Take me down to Alabama
Show me some of that laid back vibe
Kissin' while we're fishin' in the moonlight

Shine like California, high like an Arizona noontime
Baby, when you're all mine anywhere, any place I go
You feel like a home to me, you feel like a home to me

Love's taken me across the map
All the way to hell and back
Gave everything I had
And I lost my mind a couple times

Met you and I was sure
I found the center of the universe
Hit the interstate fast
Now I'm never looking back, no, lookin' back, lookin' back, oh no

Got a heart like Indiana, laugh like Louisiana
Take me down to Alabama
Show me some of that laid back vibe
Kissin' while we're fishin' in the moonlight

Shine like California, high like an Arizona noontime
Baby, when you're all mine anywhere, any place I go
You feel like a home to me, you feel like a home to me
You feel like home

Got a heart like Indiana, laugh like Louisiana
Take me down to Alabama
Show me some of that laid back vibe
Kissin' while we're fishin' in the moonlight

Shine like California, high like an Arizona noontime
Baby, when you're all mine anywhere, any place I go
You feel like a home to me, you feel like home to me
You feel like home, you feel like a home to me

Hot sun goin' down
Heatin' up this little town
The cows are fed and the plowin's all been done
Moonlight, fireflies
Beer on the bank by the riverside
We're gonna have ourselves a little fun

Dancin' on the tailgates
And raisin' a little cane
Rockin' in the pastures
And rollin' in the hay

It's the life I love
And I'm gonna live it 'til they bury me
I can't get enough of
Dirt roads and dusty fields and the simple things
And I take pride
In everything I've got
'Cause I'm American-born
And Country by the grace of God

I don't need no Cadillacs
You can't put no hay bails on the back
It won't cross a creek
Or tow no heavy load
I don't like a high-rise
Cluttering up my clear blue skies
Don't wanna be where the city's all that grows

Some are born with a silver spoon
And some come from the farm
Some have a ball in the mansion
But we get down in the barn

It's the life I love
And I'm gonna live it 'til they bury me
I can't get enough of
Dirt roads and dusty fields and the simple things
And I take pride
In everything I've got
'Cause I'm American-born
And Country by the grace of God

We build a world of dreams
On a big ol' piece of land
We're free to do anything we like
We're country so we can

It's the life I love
And I'm gonna live it 'til they bury me
I can't get enough of
Dirt roads and dusty fields and the simple things
And I take pride
In everything I've got
'Cause I'm American-born
And country by the grace of God...

Lookin' in the bathroom mirror puttin' my makeup on
Maybelline can't hide the lines of time that's gone
I weighed 105 soakin' wet, I'd knock 'em dead in that sun dress
Had it all just too young to know
That was twenty years and, two husbands ago

I remember when he took my hand and said "I do"
And the kitchen I was standing in, when he said "I'm through"
And I swore I'd never fall back in, put my heart through that again
Never let somebody get that close
But that was twenty years and, two husbands ago

Water under the bridge
I guess that's all life really is, that's just the way it is

Driving the kids to school today, it occurred to me
With all the wrong turns I've made
I'm where I should be
But I go back there from time to time
Lookin' for that peace of mind
And find it's always just a dead-end road
Yeah that was twenty years and, two husbands ago

Water under the bridge
I guess that's all life really is, that's just the way it is

Lookin' in the bathroom mirror puttin' my makeup on

At the old north pole
Got my rig all loaded with toys
Got a sack full of goodies
For good little girls and boys
Big dipper lookin' so bright
Milky way traffic is light
Got six tons of toys
For the girls and boys tonight

Got the same ol' sleigh
And good ol' reindeer power
Got no speed zones
Yeah we're makin' the zero hour
Everything lookin' so white
Housetop's comin' in sight
Got six tons of toys
For the girls and boys tonight

Well it's been a whole year
Since we've been down this way
Son on Christmas eve
We overload the sleigh
Everything will be alright
No I.C.C. in sight
Got six tons of toys
For the girls and boys tonight

It's down through the chimney
Where the soot is black as coal
Well I'll fill all the stockings
With as much as they can hold
The kids are sleepin' so tight
Better keep the ho ho light
Got six tons of toys
For the girls and boys tonight

Well I'm a little bit tired
But then I'm a little bit old
And if I close my eyes
The reindeer will know the way home
Well look what's comin' in sight
If you think that I'm happy you're right
Got six tons of toys
For the girls and boys tonight

Got six tons of toys
For the girls and boys tonight
Gor six tons of toys
Merry Christmas and good night
(Ho Ho Ho)


You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do


But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me


Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me


If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh


Lord make me a rainbow I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you
When she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well I've had just enough time


If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song


The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time


And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by


The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time


So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
It's funny when you're dead how people start listenin'


If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song


Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls


I can picture you the day you were born
Baby girl in your mama's arms
Destined for great things
Crazy thing bout an angel like you
All the things you know how to do
And yet the world tries to clip your wings
But you wouldn't let em, so baby go get em


Bust that ceiling out, the sky's the limit now
The world is changing fast
Rear your head back and run
Like you ain't ever done before
It's your time at last
All you've been through ain't in vain
Come on baby make it rain down shattered glass


It's kind of fun for a guy like me
Sitting here in your shotgun seat
Watching you leave them all in the dust
Because I believe in you
And I want to see your dreams come true


So bust that ceiling out, the sky's the limit now
Time to make up for the past
Rear your head back and run
Like you ain't ever done before
I want to see you kick some ass
I'm so proud to know you, girl
Most beautiful thing in the world is all but shattered glass


No time to waste, got to make this moment yours
Got a whole lot of history to make up for


So bust that ceiling out, the sky's the limit now
The world is changing fast
All you've been through ain't in vain
Come on baby make it rain down shattered glass






What's your all-time high, your good as it gets?
Your hands down best ever make-up sex?
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you asked me, mine would be you


What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your 90 proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you


Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you


What's your double dare, your go all in?
The craziest thing you ever did?
Plain as your name in this tattoo
Look on my arm, mine would be you


Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you


What's the greatest chapter in your book?
Are there pages where it hurts to look?
What's the one regret you can't work through?
You got it baby, mine would be you

Yeah, you got it baby, mine would be you


Mine would be you
Taillights fadin', daylight breakin'
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been runnin', yellin' out somethin'
To make you want to hold on to
The best love ever, girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you


Mine would be... you


We gonna do this thing?
Well, come on then!


River road, Chevy van, cherry classic coke can
Rolling on the floorboard; Fleetwood, Macklemore
Coming out the speakers, spilling on the t-shirts
Getting loud like I'm standing in the bleachers
Creek bank, tire swing, peeling off her blue jeans
Skinny deep sugar, fish a couple of new things


Hey, there ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock 'n' roll hallelujah
Throw your hands up high
If the spirit moves ya, babe
Singing hey, hey, hey
We can do it old school, ABC style
Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle


A summer jam mixtape, vodka in your lemonade
(Alright, alright) like McConaughey
White vinyl, gypsy revival
Traveling through the middle of the belt of the bible
Hula girl grass skirt shaking on the dashboard
Where we're going we don't need no passport


Hey, there ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock 'n' roll hallelujah
Throw your hands up high
If the spirit moves ya, babe
Singing hey, hey, hey
We can do it old school, ABC style
Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle


Oh, some of us like to watch and some like to dance
Though we all wake up with the same stamp on our hands
Counting stars and counting cars and just counting miles
Doing it freestyle, you style, me style
Ain't got nowhere to be child


Hey, there ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock 'n' roll hallelujah
Throw your hands up high
If the spirit moves ya, babe
Singing hey, hey, hey
We can do it old school, ABC style
Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle
Oh, you can count it all, baby 1, 2, 3, child
Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle


Well I got friends from Colorado
I got friends from Tennessee
So I got something in a bottle
And I got something from a seed
Since you said you didn't love me
Since hung me out to dry
I've been drunk up in the Smokies
On a Rocky Mountain high


Made the plans, booked the day, spent the money too
Nothing sweet 'bout a paid-for honeymoon
Million dollar view to see but she won't
Since "I do" turned right into "I don't"
So I'm chillin' in a cabin at the tip-top
Lookin' at a holler full of hemlocks
No cars, no bars or my phone
And just when you think I'm all alone


I got friends from Colorado
I got friends from Tennessee
So I got something in a bottle
And I got something from a seed
Since you said you didn't love me
Since hung me out to dry
I've been drunk up in the Smokies
On a Rocky Mountain high


These Appalachian folks
Probably think I'm losing it in these trees
Yeah, but they don't know
What kind of company I keep, yeah


Well I got friends from Colorado
I got friends from Tennessee
So I got something in a bottle
And I got something from a seed
Since you said you didn't love me
Since hung me out to dry
I've been drunk up in the Smokies
On a Rocky Mountain high
I've been drunk up in the Smokies
On a Rocky Mountain high


Jack's still on the hill 'cause Jill ran away
But Jill's got nothin' on Jack... And Jane


The snow in Montana was three feet high
The lady at the counter said: There ain't no flights
And so he called her on the telephone
He said: I'll rent a car and I'll drive home


And she said: I'll wait for you
Like I did last year
At Christmas time with your family here
And your truck broke down out in San Antone
And the gifts stayed wrapped until you got home
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you


Now he's on his cell phone is a Coupe DeVille
Talkin' to the one he loves and always will
His heart is breakin' 'cause she's there alone
Her heart is achin' 'cause she wants him home


She says: I'll wait for you like in '68
When our child was due, but I said, he'll have to wait
Until his dad gets here and stands by my side
Remember, dear, our son's first cry
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you


He didn't stop all day to eat a bite
And he finally got there around midnight
The doctor said, she's in a better place
She said to give you this note just in case


And it said, I'll wait for you at Heaven's gate
Oh, I don't care how long it takes
And I'll tell Saint Pete I can't come in
Without my love and my best friend
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you


P.S. I love you, too
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you


How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?


How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?


I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?


How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?


I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?


I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

So you think that you're the one who's up in score
Just 'cause you're the first one walkin' out the door
Well take it when you leave
I don't need the sympathy

I might stay up drunk on wine, hurt like hell, and ugly cryin' black mascara tears
I might lock my door, sleep with my phone, miss you bad for a month or so
But let me tell you somethin my dear
I'm gonna be just fine but you're never gonna find another love like mine
Oh no no

See I think you think that new means better off
But the proof's in the pudding once the shine is lost
So go and get yourself
A little taste of somethin else

I might stay up drunk on wine, hurt like hell, and ugly cryin' black mascara tears
I might lock my door, sleep with my phone, miss you bad for a month or so
But let me tell you somethin my dear
I'm gonna be just fine but you're never gonna find another love like mine yeah

It's startin to sound like a good idea
The more we're standin here

I'm gonna stay up drunk on wine, hurt like hell, and ugly cryin' black mascara tears
I'm gonna lock my door, sleep with my phone, miss you bad for a month or so
But let me tell you somethin my dear
I'm gonna be just fine but you're never gonna find, no
I'm gonna be just fine but you're never gonna find, no
I'm gonna be just fine but you're never gonna find another love like mine
Oh no no
Never gonna find another love like mine, oh no no


(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)


Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'


We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)


I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should


We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone (together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (we should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby we shouldn't be drinking alone


I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home


We should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinking alone together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (drinking alone, drinking alone) together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (we should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)


We should be drinking alone
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh


You think I'd be more resistant
To put myself in this position
Yeah, we always go there
Down a road that leads nowhere
Somewhere between lovers and just friends


Saw you parked outside the party
I knew you'd be by the bar
I wish there was a heart I could borrow just 'til tomorrow
Cause this is always how it starts


So tonight, gonna kiss you with my lips
Gonna hold you in my arms
Throw shadows in the dark
I'll let you in against my better judgement
Wishing I could love you, love you, love you
With somebody else's heart
Somebody else's heart, somebody else's heart


I wish I could feel the falling
But someone else could hit the ground
Wanna feel the buzz of getting closer without the hangover
But I could use another round


So tonight, I'm gonna kiss you with my lips
Gonna hold you in my arms
Throw shadows in the dark
I'll let you in against my better judgement
Wishing I could love you, love you, love you
With somebody else's heart
Somebody else's heart, somebody else's heart
With somebody else's heart


I wish there was a heart I could borrow just 'til tomorrow (tomorrow)


So tonight, gonna kiss you with my lips
Gonna hold you in my arms
Throw shadows in the dark
I'll let you in against my better judgement
Wishing I could love you, love you, love you
With somebody else's heart
Somebody else's heart, somebody else's heart
With somebody else's heart (With somebody else's heart)
With somebody else's heart

Close your eyes, can you see me...
Rollin' down the Rocky Mountains
Movin' like the wind that sweeps the Kansas plains
I know you're with me
As I make my way through Oklahoma
Pass the barns and weather vanes
There are motels, cafes, fields and billboard signs
A thousand miles of highway
Between your heart and mine...

There will finally come a moment
When one man and one woman
Get everything that they've been waiting for...
I'll take you in my arms again
Feel your skin against my skin
Let the sheet fall slowly to the floor
Til nothing comes between us anymore...

In my soul I can feel you...
As I cross the Mississippi
You're the river flowin' in me
Comin' home I count each heartbeat...
Til the moment we're together
And the distance can't be measured
That's all that keeps me goin'
When I'm gone...

There will finally come a moment
When one man and one woman
Get everything that they've been waiting for...
I'll take you in my arms again
Feel your skin against my skin
Let the sheet fall slowly to the floor
Til nothing comes between us anymore...

Anymore...

There will finally come a moment
When one man and one woman
Get everything that they've been waiting for...
I'll take you in my arms again
Feel your skin against my skin
Let the sheet fall slowly to the floor
Til nothing comes between us anymore...

There will finally come a moment
When one man and one woman
Get everything, everything, everything (Fade out)


You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
Doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song, and you'll never feel
Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm comin' off this
Long and winding road


I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
Home sweet home


You know that I've seen
Too many romantic dreams
Up in lights, fallin' off
The silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read (world to read)
Sometimes nothing
Keeps me together
At the seams


I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
Just set me free (Just set me free)
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet home


Yeah, I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
Home sweet home
Yeah!
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
Just set me free (Just set me free)
Home sweet home


Hello world, hope you’re listening
Forgive me if I’m young
Or speaking out of turn
But there’s someone i’ve been missing
And I think that they could be
The better half of me
They’re in the wrong place trying to make it right
But I’m tired of justifying
So I say to you...


Come home, come home
Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
So come home


I get lost in the beauty of everything I see
The world ain’t as half as bad
As they paint it to be
When all the sons, all the daughters stop to take it in
Then hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin
It might start now
Maybe I’m just dreaming out loud
But until then...


Come home, come home
Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
So come home


Everything i can’t be
Is everything you should be
And that’s why i need you here
Everything i can’t be
Is everything you should be
And that’s why i need you here
So hear this now


Come home, come home
Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
Ever known
Come home, come home
Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
Ever known
Come home

I'm home


Real men love women
Fast cars and livin’
Out on the edge so far
They’re gonna need forgivin’
Real men like football
Cowboys and outlaws
Can’t help but fly so high
It’s gonna hurt to fall


Like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin’
Round and round and round they go
Cold beer and a dirty hand
Calling home every chance they can
To say I love you
They don’t need a reason


Real men love Jesus
And they love mama
If they can get more than forty hours
You know they gonna
They give it hell till they get it right
The kind every country girl’s tryin’ to find
Every girl’s daddy’s kinda guy
Ain’t scared to pray, ain’t scared to fight


They like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin’
Round and round and round they go
Cold beer and a dirty hand
Calling home every chance they can
To say I love you
They don’t need a reason
Real men love Jesus


Real men love Jesus
They don’t believe in leavin’
When the goin’ gets tough
They just keep on keepin’


They like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin’
Round and round and round they go
Cold beer and a dirty hand
Calling home every chance they can
To say I love you
They don’t need a reason
Real men love Jesus
Real men love Jesus


I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got


'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet


Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there


'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet


Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah


'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet
Life is short, make it sweet
Oh yeah

My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm
Way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts
With a quick turn of his wrench
He pulled splinters from his hand
Never even flinched

In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that grandpa died, I realized

Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

Then there was my junior year
Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch
They brought the helicopter in
And Billy couldn't feel his legs
Said he'd never walk again

But Billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed
And the day we graduated, he stood up to say

Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

So don't tell me that it's over
Don't give up on you and me
'Cause there's no such thing as hopeless
If you believe

Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible


I know everybody wants you
That ain't no secret
Hey baby, what's your status?
And tell me are you tryna keep it?
Well, they can all back off
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got your attention
Did I mention:


If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take (hey!)
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love, ain't afraid to break (hey!)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well, I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby, I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah


I'm calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine


Make everybody jealous
When I take you off the market
And get my lipstick on your right cheek
Cause boy, I've gotta mark it
Oooh
So they can all back off (yeah)
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got you listening
Come on and show me what I'm missing
Yeah


If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take (hey!)
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love, ain't afraid to break (hey!)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well, I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby, I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah
I'll calling dibs
If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
Hey
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love, ain't afraid to break
Hey
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well, I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby, I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah

Santa Baby, slip a sable under the tree
For me
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight


Santa baby, a '54 convertible too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight


Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check off my Christmas list


Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not
A lot
Been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight


Santa honey, there's one thing I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight


Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a duplex
And checks
Sign your x on the line
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight


Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me


Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney

Here I am, There You are
Tangled up with her
In our bed, in our bedroom

I Loved you with Everything inside of me
Wasn't that enough? Enough for You?
Now There's Nothing I can do...

If I could pull you back
From where you've been
I would but you've left me no reason left to fight...
You've crossed a line you can't uncross
You've made a choice and now there's no way to ever make it right
If my tears had any power
I would Cry, I Would Cry...

I Don't Wanna to know her name
Or that it happened only once
Don't wanna Hear your excuse

Did You Think about our Home
Our Lives, & All We Had?
Or did you just forget You Had So Much To Lose?
No, There's Nothing You can Do...

If I could pull you back
From where you've been
I would but you've left me no reason left to fight...
You've crossed a line you can't uncross
You've made a choice and now there's no way to ever make it right
If my tears had any power
I would Cry, I Would Cry...

You've crossed a line you can't uncross
You've made a choice and now there's no way to ever make it right
If my tears had any power
I would Cry, I Would Cry

I saw you before you saw me
Yeah, it really took me back
Can't believe how long it's been

Took you awhile to recognize me
Oh, imagine that
When we were so close back then

No, nothing stays the same
Love, oh it slips away, it slips away

Everything changes, doesn't it baby?
It's amazing how time flies
Turning the pages of yesterday, hey
And in only the blink of an eye
Everything changes, everything changes

Somewhere I still have a picture
You were in that party dress
I remember dancing slow
Thought those days would last forever
How soon we forget
And how far away they go

No, nothing stays the same
Love, oh it fades away, it fades away

Everything changes, doesn't it baby?
It's amazing how time flies
Turning the pages of yesterday, hey
And in only the blink of an eye
Everything changes, everything changes

We try to hold it in our hands
But love falls through like grains of sand
One day it's there and then it's gone, gone, gone, gone

Everything changes, doesn't it baby?
It's amazing how time flies
Turning the pages of yesterday, hey
In only the blink of an eye
Everything changes, everything changes

There's a pool hall, jukebox and
Sawdust floors
Three plays for a quarter and they still
Want more
Yeah, there's a reason for fast cars
And that double yellow line
Hearbread songs and good cheap
Two dollar wine

'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, longneck
Bottles, rusty old pick up trucks
Oh, at last call the lights go up
And it's all because of people like us

I got a second-hand boat, the last owner's in jail
There's second-hand smoke everywhere I exhale
There's greasy little truck stops and all night dives
No tell motels and everybody knows why

'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, longneck
Bottles, rusty old pick up trucks
Oh, at last call the lights go up
And it's all because of people like us

'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, longneck
Bottles, rusty old pick up trucks
Oh, at last call the lights go up
And it's all because of people like us

'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, longneck
Bottles, rusty old pick up trucks
Oh, at last call the lights go up
And it's all because of people like us


So hot outside all I can wear
Is these cut off overalls
And these sandals on my feet
But I emptied my pockets for a bus ticket
So I could sit there on a broken seat
I got no place i should go
I got no worries you know
Second or seventh street
It doesn't matter to me


Because you're mine
That's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right cause I've got you to hold
Every night yeah
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one


Well I pulled back down to my up street apartment
And the air never works in that old place
Twenty-seven and I thought i'd be further along
Than just this rented space
I got no papers to read
I got no cable tv
And I got no places to be
I got no people to meet




I'm on a roll
When I'm with you
Don't stop me now
I just can't lose



It ain't his fault that she went A.W.O.L
'Cause he tried everything from A to Z
Now it's J&B, M&M's and KFC
Tryin' hard to make himself believe

It ain't no B.F.D he's got his C.M.T
No S E X but that's okay
At least he ain't no S.O.B like that Ph.D
That took his EX and ran off to L.A

She liked C.N.N made fun of his T.N.N
Always called it E I E I O
Now their love is RIP but at least he's F R E E
And he ain't cryin' on his P I L L O

It ain't no B.F.D, he's got his C.M.T
No S.E.X but that's okay
At least he ain't no S.O.B like that P.h.D
That took his EX and ran off to L.A

One night he ordered pizza
For some R&R with the N.F.L
When a delivery girl named Lisa
Stole his heart when she rang his bell

Now they're in L U V and it's X T C
No S E X yet but that's A okay
Feels just like a VIP with all of her T.L.C
And A.S.A.P, she'll be his fiancÃƒÂ©e
And that's a B.F.D in a real good way

She was waiting tables in a diner off of highway 41
On his way to Indiana on another midnight run
So they talked about the weather, and the next thing that you knew
The hours flew by like minutes
It was time he had to go

On a rainy highway halfway out of town
A voice inside his heart said turn those 18 wheels around...

And go back
You got somebody waiting
Go back
Thats where you need to be... right now
There's nothing in this world
More important than that
So go back

They settled down in a little house
In the spring of '92
And She quit her job at the diner
With the baby almost due
Those early years weren't easy
And they had bills to pay
So he said you know I hate to leave you but I'll be back by Saturday

10 miles out of Tulsa
His boss came on his radio
Said if you wanna see your brand new daughter
You better drop that load

And go back
You got somebody waiting
Go back
Thats where you need to be... right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back

Everybody heard the sirens
They pulled his rig out of the snow
In a rush to see his family
Somehow he lost control
Though the doctors tried to save him
He slipped into the light
But then he heard the angels whisper...
Now is not your time

Go back
You got somebody waiting
Go back
Thats where you need to be... right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back


8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying "come on he ain’t worth the pain"
"Do what you gotta do to forget his name"
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye


What I’m really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender


Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
Cause tonight it’s all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay


What I’m really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender


I’m feeling that buzz
I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I’m coming in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh, oh, oh, oh


Hey Bartender
What I’m really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Hey bartender


She was staring out the window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18
She said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head and said, I was just like you


You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this


Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her, it's a nice place
She says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down


Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this


Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing
One kid's crying, one kid's screaming
She keeps apologizing
He says, they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's 36, one's 23
Heh... It's hard to believe, but


But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this
Yeah, you're gonna miss this

I'm gonna dress up, in my low-cut
My tight blue jeans, I'm gonna stir somethin' up
I'm gonna kiss all the boys 'til I kiss your memory goodbye
Yeah, I'm a gonna drink myself single tonight

A bottle of red, a bottle of white
Which one will it be, I can't decide
I guess I'll find out once I drink those bottles dry
Yeah, I'm a gonna drink myself single tonight

I wanna find out what it's like
To stagger in the house like you do every night
Sneakin' in the bed like I don't know the truth
I really wanna know what it's like to be you

I wanna find out what it's like
To stagger in the house like you do every night
Sneakin' in the bed like I don't know the truth
I really wanna know what it's like to be you

A bottle of red, a bottle of white
Which one will it be, I can't decide
I guess I'll find out once I drink those bottles dry
Yeah, I'm a gonna drink myself single tonight

A bottle of red
A bottle of white
Which one will it be
I can't decide

Yeah, I'm a gonna drink myself single tonight
Oh, I'm a gonna drink myself single tonight


I'm gonna take you for a date
Take you for a ride
Gonna get you over there on the passenger's side
I'm gonna put the radio on your favorite song
I'm gonna crank it on up and get you singing along


Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Alright (alright)
Girl I'm digging on hittin' on you tonight
It ain't a maybe, it's hopin' I, wishin' I wanna
It's the damn right, hold you tight, baby I'm gonna


So what's it gonna take?
What's it gonna be?
We can pump it on the boulevard
Or kick it in the country
Me and you, you and me
Money back, guaranteed
Love you every night in Daytona, I'm gonna


Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Alright (alright)
Girl I'm digging on hittin' on you tonight

Gonna be your man
Gonna put a little rock steady on your hand

Alright (alright)
Oooh
Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Alright (alright)


Five of the PM rolls around
There's a little old joint outside of town
I only got time for a couple of beers
And a jukebox song ringing in my ears

The next you know
The bartenders pouring
Shots are flowing
Got me stoning
All I really know is that I should be going
But I'm soaking up the moment


I'm all jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies
When you're all jacked up


It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock
What the hell
I have one more shot

Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar
Guess I mighta musta gone a little too far
Cause a big 'ol girl walked outta the blue

Ten foot, two
With a bad attitude
Stepped right up
And knocked out my tooth
Guess I had it coming I deserved the due


Cause I was all jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff
When you're all jacked up


Don't have to go home
But you can't stay here
That's what they said when I got my last beer


Oh my God, it's 2:00
I can't find my keys and my trucks locked
So I grabbed a tire tool
And I broke my window

Hurt my elbow
Got me in though
Two foot later
Backed into the light pole
All the town folk got a good show


All jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your truck
When you're all jacked up

Jacked up
(All jacked up, all jacked up)
Ooh, oooh, oooooh

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff
When you're all jacked up

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your car
Don't start no stuff in no bar
Hell
I wouldn't even tell anybody where you are
When you're all jacked up

All jacked up
All jacked up
All jacked up

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Everybody knows her,little Miss Rosa
The queen of the trailer park
Well,she's a hot pepper and you'll never forget her
If you ever let her break your heart
Senor' Jose,works all day
Sweatin' in the red hot sun
Row after row,everybody knows
What they do when the weekend comes

He drinks tequila,and she talks dirty in spanish
Him in his sombrero,her in her purty pink jammies
The dance all night to the Mariachis
Till there ain't nobody left standin'
He drinks tequila,and she talks dirty in spanish

Well,the music is blarin' and the neighbors are starin'
That whole dang trailer is a-rockin'
Jose's a-howling',the Chihuahua's growlin'
And Rosie's peelin' off her silk stockings
"Yo Senora,kiss my body,a brasa mi puerta"
"Ay,yi yi yi yi,hoochie-coo,to dal ay nochay"

He drinks tequila,and she talks dirty in spanish
Him in his sombrero,her in her purty pink jammies
The dance all night to the Mariachis
Till there ain't nobody left standin'
He drinks tequila,and she talks dirty in spanish

He drinks tequila,and she talks dirty in spanish
Him in his sombrero,her in her purty pink jammies
The dance all night to the Mariachis
Till there ain't nobody left standin'
He drinks tequila,and she talks dirty in spanish


If I could be the reason your hair's a mess
The bass drum beatin way down deep in your chest
If I could be the voice on your radio
Then I could be your long ride home


If mine could be the name that changes yours
The wine in your glass, the swing on your porch
The dollar in your pocket and the peaceful in your sleep
Then I'd be what you mean to me


Standing here, watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low, dancing slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me


If I could be the fire in your firefly
The cool in the rain, the spark in your eye
The answer to your prayer
And the faith that sets you free
Then I'd be what you mean to me


Standing here, watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low, dancing slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
What you mean to me


And oh, all of this talking makes you laugh
But I've gotta let you know
Just how I feel while i'm


Standing here, watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low, dancing slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
What you mean to me


Yeah, if falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
Be what you mean to me
Ohhhhh, be what you mean
What you mean, what you mean
What you mean to me, mmm-mmm


Her kisses taste like whiskey
Burning through my veins
She don't know how to miss me
She hits right where she aims
Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch


She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on


Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back
She's Revlon red in the blackest night
Lighting up the room in the world just like


She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on


Once she gets it started, man, it's all night long
She's the needle on the vinyl of a midnight song
She's turning me on, turning me on


She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on, yeah


Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
(Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Oooh, oooh, oooh)

6:30 in the morning
I'm in the middle of the sweetest dream
When I hear that alarm clock calling me
I wrestle with the feeling
That the day is starting way too soon
I hit the button just to buy a little time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes

I love the way the sunlight
Dances on your perfect skin
Girl, I wish this night would never end
But we gotta get moving
You can't eat if you don't get paid
But I got us a better idea
Just pull up the covers and stay right here

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes

I hit the button just one more time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
Oh yeah, for another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
This is my dream and I'm gonna stay in it
Oh, for another nine

Another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
Another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
(Another nine minutes) Let the world stop
(Another nine minutes) Don't worry about the clock
(Another nine minutes) Ooooh, yeah
(Another nine minutes) Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late

(Another nine minutes) (repeat to fadeout)

Palm trees and beautiful hips
Man it dosen't get any better than this
Sun settin' like fire on the Viper Room
Old Lemmy holed up at the bar
And Johnny Depp pickin' on an old guitar
Man I wish old Keith would've taught em how to keep it in tune

I came here lookin' for love
But all I found was sex and drugs
Strung out, broke down, homesick and thinkin' of you

There ain't nothin' like a Tennessee mountain top
Some straight shootin' neighbors that don't name drop
With a preacher man prayin' for peace but still packin' a gun
Singing karaoke in a double wide
With smoke so thick it'll burn your eyes
Oh oh, my sweet Lord I'll warn ya
Fall in love with an angel
You'll end up in California

High tide I felt so alive
Until I spent six hours on the 405
In a jacked up rocky ridge straight rollin' coal
But then I, I turned up the radio
And hear a bunch of... that's got no soul
All pop and hip-hop but no damn rock n roll

I came here lookin' for love
But ended up on a bathroom rug
On my knees prayin' God please see me through

There ain't nothin' like a Tennessee mountain top
Some straight shootin' neighbors that don't name drop
With a preacher man prayin' for peace but still packin' a gun
Singing karaoke in a double wide
With smoke so thick it'll burn your eyes
Oh oh, my sweet Lord I'll warn ya
Fall in love with an angel
You'll end up in California

There ain't nothin' like a Tennessee mountain top
Some straight shootin' neighbors that don't name drop
With a preacher man prayin' for peace but still packin' a gun
Singing karaoke in a double wide
Some sweet southern sugar right by my side
Oh oh, my sweet Lord I'll warn ya
Fall in love with an angel
Fall in love with an angel, yeah
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, love, love
With an angel


She likes whiskey with her water
She starts dancing when the stars come out
She ain’t your typical preacher’s daughter
She’ll leave you dreamin’, yeah there ain’t no doubt


There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
She’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
Got a rebel heart a country mile wide
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
A little bit of devil in her angel eyes


Saturday night she’s rockin’ out by the bonfire
Flirting from that tail gate and crankin’ up the dial
Come Sunday mornin’ she’ll be singing with the choir
Drivin’ me crazy with that kiss me smile


There’s a little bit of devil in those angel eyes
She’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
Got a rebel heart a country mile wide
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes


And I can’t stop wonderin’ what it would feel like, to hold her all night
She’s got that something, that sexy innocence, she must be heaven sent


There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
She’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
Got a rebel heart a country mile wide
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
There’s a little bit of devil in those angel eyes
She’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
Got a rebel heart a country mile wide
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
There’s a little bit of devil in her
In those angel, in those angel eyes


How do I love you. well let me see
I love you like a lyric love a melody
Baby, completely wrapped up in you
How do I need you, well can't you tell
I need you like a penny needs a wishing well
Baby, completely wrapped up in you


Every now and then when the world
That we're living in is crazy
You gladly hold me and carry me through
No one in the world has ever done
What you do for me and I'd be
Sad and lonely if there were no you


How do I love you, well count the ways
There ain't a number high enough to end this phrase
Baby, completely wrapped up in you




How do I love you, well, don't you know
I love you about as deep as any love can grow
Baby, completely wrapped up in you

A little purple Ford about to bust
Completely stuffed
With CD's,clothes and bunch of old junk
Her little sister can't understand why she's leaving us
Her other sister said,"Shut up"
An baby brother's busy playing with his trucks

Oh,she's good to go on her own
Momma hold her tears 'til she disappears
My God our baby's grown
Oh,she's gonna be all right
She'll make a life
Somewhere out there
Just how or where
She doesn't care
She only knows
She's good to go

From fifteen to seventeen I think she spoke two words
That I never heard
But I'm sure it had to do with something she disagreed with
Tonight at dinner there'll be an empty chair
And a daddy's prayer
Asking for a little more faith to believe that

Oh,she's good to go
Momma hold her tears 'til she disappears
My God our baby's grown
Oh,she's gonna be all right
She'll make a life
Somewhere out there
Just how or where
She doesn't care
She only knows
She's good to go

I close my eyes and I see her in diapers on her rockin' horse
Selling lemonade
First bike,first grade,first date,prom night
Now she's in the drive wavin' goodbye

Oh,she's good to go,on her own
Momma hold your tears 'til she disappears
My God our baby's grown
Oh,she's gonna be all right
She'll make a life
Somewhere out there
Just how or where
She doesn't car
She only knows
She's good to go

Yeah,I think she's good to go

She got my full attention
With an out of nowhere question
I thought she knew the answer to
She felt the need to ask
Cause just last night she'd had
Some crazy dream about losing me
She said do I still turn you on and fill your every need
I need to hear you say you still love me

CHORUS:
And I don't mean sometimes
Not almost always
Not a little or most times
All night and all day
Tell me I'm in your heart and on
Your mind
Baby and I don't mean sometimes

I told her darlin' shake me
Next time that you're awakened
By the thought that I could go
And I'll take you in my arms
Oh with all my heart
I'll make it clear that I ain't going nowhere

Yes you're all I want and all I'll ever need
I'm still hopelessly in love as I can be

And I don't mean sometimes
Not almost always
Not a little or most times
All night and all day
Tell me I'm in your heart and on
Your mind
Baby and I don't mean sometimes

She got my full attention
With an out of nowhere question
I thought she knew the answer to

(Shaunna Bolton/Kevin Savigar)

I woke up today with a headache
More bills to pay than a corporation
Hey, when will it end
My mirror says I could use a break
An easy day, some appreciation
Hey how 'bout a friend
When days like these start to fall in on me
I gotta face my reflection and say...hey

Chorus:
Been burned by the fire
Been stuck under water
Strung up on a wire and still the world goes around
Been tossed like a free throw
Knocked out when the wind blows
Pull the curtain on the hurtin'
'Cause I'm not going down
(I'm not going down no no)

Inside of me is the only
Highway that leads to a true freedom
Holding out it's hand
I close my eyes and it's all right
The sun will shine on a new horizon
Just around the bend
Days like these bring out the strength in me
So I can face my reflection and say...

Repeat chorus

I still get dizzy and frantic, lonely and paniced
But next time I won't let it beat me, no
I can see clearly, I know who I am
And that's how I know I've begun living

Repeat chorus (out)


I got a home down on the river
I'm married to the woman of my dreams
Got a good truck that gets me down the highway
Everything is perfect or so it seems
Momma and daddy come by sometimes
And everything is fine
My old dog does a little singing
Late at night when the moon gets bright
Sunday morning hear the church bells ringing
Let us go and see who's getting baptized
We gonna take us a Sunday drive
Cause everything is fine


Everything is fine, fine, fine
Through the sunshine and the rain
I got a peace of mind
You know I can't complain
I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feeling good and everything is fine


Got the same job down at the warehouse
Ain't never been rich but I sleep at night
Got a little girl that looks like her mamma
She likes it when her daddy tucks her in real tight
One night this week we're gonna have a fish fry




I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feeling good and everything is fine
I'm feeling good and everything is fine


Strictly outta curiosity
What would happen if you got with me?
Kissin' you would hit the spot with me
Come on skip a couple rocks with me


Give me any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
I got something we can start tonight
Lookin' at you girl, it's hard to fight


Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
T-shirt of your favourite rock band
Checkin' your makeup in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback


Come on baby, shoot a smile at me
Midnight selfie on a balcony
A little somethin' for my life screamin'
You're burnin' a hole in my pocket
And we've got the beat, let's drop it


Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
Tattoos, cut-offs, and converse
Singin' along to the song with the wrong words
Every move you make baby it works
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback


Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
T-shirt of your favourite rock band
Checkin' your makeup in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback


Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But you’re the kinda girl that’s got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ain’t nothing
They ain’t never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain’t nothing hotter


Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown


Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying “Son it’s on”
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song


Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown


Ooh baby, baby, baby
You’re driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
I’m a long way away from where I’m from
But baby you feel like home


Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown


If you see my number on your phone when you pick it up
Or get a good morning text when your waking up
Or see my truck driving by at the end of the day
If you get a letter in the mail from me now and then
Or find a note on your door from me checking in
If I send you a rose or a whole bouquet
Well, pay no mind
I just forget to forget you sometimes


It ain't nothing but a habit, I can break it
I can shake it, I can make it on my own
Ain't like I really care or I miss you
Or it matters or I wish you weren't gone
Don't think I'm that
God, I got to get you back
Probably never going to get over you kind
I just forget to forget you sometimes


I wish you would've caught me out rocking last night
Instead of catching me sitting at this green light
Baby, I was on a roll 'til I heard that song
It ain't nothing but a ghost then it's gone again
Ain't like I'm still stuck in what could'a been
Every part of me wants to be moving on
Except the back of my mind
It just forgets to forget you sometimes



I don't understand why we do what we do to each other
According to his word, we're all born sisters and brothers
But we lie and we steal
Fight and we kill
Even though we know the way

Chorus:
Why do we go dancing in circles
When we know
It never ends
We come so close to loving each other and then
We go dancing in circles again

All through the ages we try to share this world together
Turning the pages pretending we'll live here forever
But we'll have to face our maker someday
And reap what we've sown on the way

Repeat chorus

Bridge:
We know how so
Why can't we just get it right
I pray someday we'll overcome all the damage we've done and we'll fly

Last night I tried so hard to sleep
I counted half a million sheep
And my whole life passed right before my eyes
I pondered on the universe
It only went from bad to worse
And I wondered what would happen if I died
I think I've been thinking way too much
I say it's a perfect time for us, to

Live it up
There ain't no time to waste no time
And there ain't no better time to celebrate
Hurry up, oh can't you feel the urgency
There ain't nothing we can do when it's too late
And too late's gonna catch us soon enough
So let's live it up

Old Man Jones with all he knows
You never see him smile
You know he's sittin' on that big portfolio
It's clear that all that's on his mind
Is the top of the ladder and the bottom line
But he can take it with him when he goes
Poor old Jones he never learned to dance
I bet he'd trade it all for one more chance to

Live it up
There ain't no time to waste no time
And there ain't no better time to celebrate
Hurry up, oh can't you feel the urgency
There ain't nothing we can do when it's too late
And too late's gonna catch us soon enough
So let's live it up

Sand keeps slipping through the hour glass
Everyday's more precious than the last, so

Live it up
There ain't no time to waste no time
And there ain't no better time to celebrate
Hurry up, yeah life is an emergency
There ain't nothing we can do when it's too late
And too late's gonna catch us soon enough
So let's live it up

Live it up
There ain't no time to waste no time
And there ain't no better time to celebrate
Hurry up, oh can't you feel the urgency
There ain't nothing we can do when it's too late
And too late's gonna catch us soon enough
So let's live it up


You feel like a candle in a hurricane
Just like a picture with a broken frame
Alone and helpless
Like you've lost your fight
But you'll be alright, you'll be alright


Because when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend, till you break
Cause its all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad you get strong
Wipe your hands shake it off
Then you Stand, Then you stand


Life's like a novel
With the end ripped out
The edge of a canyon
With only one way down
Take what you're given before it's gone
Start holding on, keep holding on


Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend till you break
Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, then you stand


Every time you get up
And get back in the race
One more small piece of you
Starts to fall into place
Oh




Oh man, you've got to watch where you're stepping around here
Yeah I got a friend in New York City
He's never heard of Connway Twitty
Don't know nothing about grits and greens
Never been south of Queens
But he flew down here on a business trip
I took him honky tonking and that was it
He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud


We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone


Nah, you aren’t got to be born out in the sticks
With an F-150 and a 30-06
Or have a bubba in the family tree
To get on down with me
Yeah, bubba all you need is an open mind
If it fires you up you got to let it shine
When it feels so right that it can't be wrong
Come on, come on, come on

You aren’t alone
You aren’t alone


We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone



Come on y'all


We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone


I've always wanted to sing the bone song


I talk to God about you
And I ain't even met you yet
Everybody's waitin' on you here
I can't wait to feel your heart beat
When I lay you on my chest
I'm already holding back my tears
I wanna be the dad that my dad was
I hope that I don't mess this whole thing up


I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you


I know you're gonna grow up some day
But don't forget to take your time
And take the time to call back home
It ain't always gonna be easy
It ain't always gonna be fair
I know you ain't always gonna need me
But I promise that I'll always be there


I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you


I talk to God about you
When everything around me breaks
I look up and hear him say


Love like your momma
And forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, thats what I do
When I pray for you
When I pray for you
When I pray for you


I was just coastin', never really goin anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue, I fell for you


Now you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies


Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new all because of you


And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies


Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies

Love the way you look in that dress
Um, you've got me thinkin' thoughts in my head
The way your body's movin' slowly to the music
Only leaves me wantin' more

So, baby, let's don't call it a night
Love the way you're holdin' me tight
When you're next to me there's no place I'd rather be
Everything is feeling so right
So, baby, let's don't call it a night

Just let that clock tick away
'Cause in the morning we can sleep in late
Right now, let's spend our time on what we've got in mind
I'll get up and close the door

Let's don't call it a night
Love the way you're holdin' me tight
When you're next to me, there's no place I'd rather be
Everything is feeling so right
Now, baby, let's don't call it a night

Well, baby's let's don't call it a night
Yeah, I love the way you're holdin' me, holdin' me tight
When you're next to me, there's no place I'd rather be
Everything is feeling so right
So, baby, let's don't call it, no, let's don't call it a night
No, no, no, no, no, no

She puts her boots and bandanna on
She has a hankering for Rolling Stones
She likes her vegetables home grown
A lot like the boy waiting out in the truck

She'll take a hill like Roosevelt
Holds up her pants with a Bible belt
She cracks 'em up like a liberty bell
A whole lot of tender and a little bit tough


Ooh, ooh, ooh
She's a little unusual
Ooh, ooh, ooh
She's American beautiful

Well, he is a mutt with a pedigree
Sinatra junkie in a pair of jeans
He pays his dues in the Land of the Free
Says, why walk
Baby, we were born to run


Ooh, ooh, ooh
He's a little unusual
Ooh, ooh, ooh
He's American beautiful

I saw that girl in a mirror once
With a boy like that in a cloud of dust
I think they look a lot like us
Cause we are, we are, we are


Ooh, ooh, ooh
We are a little unusual
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We are American beautiful

Ooh, ooh, ooh
We are a little unusual
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We are American, American, American beautiful


I woke up again this morning
And wouldn't you know it... pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like us I poured it down the drain


Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song


I know I said I wouldn't miss you
But now I'm saying I'm a fool
You're on the feel good side of leaving
And I'm the backside of a mule


And I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my so sad come back song


And now I'm laying down without you
In this king size empty bed
And I wish I had my arms around you
But I'll just dream of you instead




Hey, I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go and letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song


Oh yeah yeah

I know I said I wouldn't miss you
I said I wouldn't miss you girl, yeah



Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

We all sang na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, yeah

Come on now

This is my my bad, come back song


In a water tower town everybody waves
Church doors are the only thing that's open on Sundays
Word travels fast, wheels turn slow
Yeah working hard and living right is the only life we know


Friday night football is king
Sweet tea goes good with anything
The fireflies come out when the sun goes down
Nobody eats until you say Amen
And everybody knows your mom and them
You can see who loves who for miles around
In a water tower town


Where your friend's a friend and your word's your word
And our pickup trucks, they ain't for looks, they're made for work
Corn grows high, crime stays low
There's little towns everywhere where everybody knows


Friday night football is king
Sweet tea goes good with anything
And the girls come out when the sun goes down
Nobody eats until you say Amen
And everybody knows your mom and them
You can see who loves who for miles around
In a water tower town


Yeah, Friday night football is king
Sweet tea goes good with anything
Peace and quiet make such a beautiful sound
Nobody eats until you say Amen
And everybody knows your mom and them
You can see who loves who for miles around
In a water tower town


Yeah, in a water tower town

Maybe life has got you rundown
I think it's time, girl, that we slow down
So take a look, it's almost sundown

So why don't you lay right here?
Let me just ease your mind
I'm givin' you all my time
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you

Strong and slow
The way that you want me to
Maybe my whole life through
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you

When that morning sun is dawning
Baby, both of us should call in
'Cause we got too much love to fall in

So why don't you lay right here?
Let me just ease your mind
I'm givin' you all my time
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you

Strong and slow
The way that you want me to
Maybe my whole life through
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you

Why don't you lay right here?
Let me just ease your mind
Give you all my time
I'm gonna keep on, keep on

Strong and slow
The way that you want me to
Maybe my whole life through, girl
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you

Soft and slow
The way you want me to
Maybe my whole life through
I'm gonna keep on, keep on, keep on loving you
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you

J. Ingram/T. Snider

I see you looking and I know what you think
You’re getting braver with every drink but
I am telling you something you need to know

She may look like a sweet young thing
Talking to him but she ain’t hearing a thing
If you were smart you’d turn around and let her go

That girls’ a Barbie doll
A Barbie doll
She’s real good-looking but she’s got no heart at all

She puts on her makeup and drives to the bar in her
Boyfriend’s old man’s brand-new car
She’s got no idea what she does or why

She does whatever she wants I guess
Whatever comes first or whatever looks best
Nobody I know has ever seen her cry

(Chorus)
You should have seen her last Saturday night
She had a friend of mine treating her right
She was hanging on him until she found a better deal

You should have seen how cold she got
My buddy asked why and she said why not
Nobody I know swears she’s even real

(Chorus)

Well I only came into this bar
To hear a sad song
But I'll probably be here all night long
The way I'm feeling now

I couldn't get you on the phone
So, I let it ring
On and on in a lonesome serenade

Oooh, what am I gonna do about my problems now
Maybe I should try to find a way to kinda, sorta, maybe, work it out

Chorus:
Oooh, with some solitary thinkin'
And lonesome drinkin'
Oooh, it sure does make a body feel at home
And a double barrel whiskey
And oh baby, tell me do you miss me
Some solitary thinkin' and lonesome drinkin' for me tonight

There's two things that'll kill a girl
They'll strike her down right where she stands
One is his voice and one is the rock glass sitting in my hand

Oooh, lights are gettin' dimmer now
That means they gonna shut me down
And it's just like crystal
It ain't always really clear

Tell me baby now
How am I gonna get myself to sleep now that you're gone
Maybe I should try to find a way to kinda think about carrying on
On my own

Repeat Chorus

This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and
Swapping "I don't care"s

Talking politics
Blonde and red-head chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

He said "I fought two wars
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said "Damned if I know"

We talked an hour or two
'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said "These damn things will kill me yet"

But God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

Last call is 2am
I said goodbye to him
I never talk to him again

Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire

He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well

And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy


There's a million different types of girls all around the world and they're all so beautiful
No one knows any better than me 'cuz I stare so constantly
But I think I met my match last night at the club, she was sippin' on a Bud, hangin' with her friends on a Friday night


A five foot something, cherry balm she had everything going on
The first thing that caught my eye
She was rockin' the beer gut, and I love the way she's not ashamed
Rockin' the beer gut, well it's just some extra love around her waist
Rockin' the beer gut, she's more than hot, she's everything
With the blue jeans a little tight around her butt
Rockin' the beer gut


Well Toby Keith never looked so good hanging out right there on the front of her black t-shirt
As I walked up to the bar and said, "Can I buy you a drink girl?"
She spun me around and grabbed my hand and said, "First things first we're gonna dance, if you can cut a rug boy
After that, well you can."


A five foot something, cherry balm she had everything going on
The first thing that caught my eye
She was rockin' the beer gut, and I love the way she's not ashamed
Rockin' the beer gut, well it's just some extra love around her waist
Rockin' the beer gut, she's more than hot, she's everything
With the blue jeans a little tight around her butt
Rockin' the beer gut


A five foot something, cherry balm she had everything going on
The first thing that caught my eye
She was rockin' the beer gut, and I love the way she's not ashamed
Rockin' the beer gut, well it's just some extra love around her waist
Rockin' the beer gut, she's more than hot, she's everything
With the blue jeans a little tight around her butt
Rockin' the beer gut

Rockin' the beer gut

I’ll never settle down
That’s what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone

I don’t dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don’t dance

Love’s never come my way
I’ve never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart

No, I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance
Ohhh
I don’t dance

Ooh

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance

Oh
No..

Oooh…


Now there are men who make history
There are men who change the world
And there are men like me
That simply find the right girl
And in that very moment, it all becomes clear
What I’m meant to do, the reason I’m here
Now every night I thank the Lord I found you
And every time I put my arms around you


I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do


It never fails, we walk in a room
Nobody sees me, they’re all looking at you
I disappear but that’s fine with me
I feel the same way, you’re all I can see
Now they’ve written books about da Vinci’s muse
Now I know it wasn’t but it shoulda been you


'Cause I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do


Why don’t we run off to Paris while we’re still young
We could drink a little wine, have a little fun
I could tell you I love you in a foreign tongue
We could work on our French in more ways than one
I could take your hand, we could walk in the Louvre
I could show them real beauty, let them get a load of you


'Cause I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do


I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do

I got your country right here
Little bit of rockin'
I got your country right here
Deep fried Southern

I got your country
Grab a beer, pull up a chair
'Cause I got your country right here

Gimme some Waylon
Little bit of that Ramblin' Man
Our country boys can't survive
Can I get a little hand for Hank?

I got your country right here
Little bit of rockin'
I got your country right here
Deep fried Southern

I got your country right
Grab a beer, pull up a chair
'Cause I got your country right here

In any Friday night honky tonk
Anywhere they got cold beer and a band
And a dance floor packed with bikers, truckers
Lookers, soldiers, outlaw lovers
Well, I got your country right here

I got your country right here

ZZ Top, little ol' band from Texas
It's 2 o'clock, I bet you thought
I forgot Lynyrd Skynyrd
Get off you asses and raise your glasses

'Cause I got your country right here
Little bit of rockin'
I got your country right here
Deep fried Southern

I got your country right
Grab a beer, pull up a chair
'Cause I got your country right here

I got your country right here
Little bit of rockin'
I got your country right here
Deep fried Southern

Gimme that country
I got your country right here
I got your country right here

Alone with the morning burning red in the canvas in my head
Painting a picture of you
And me driving across country, in a dusty old RV
Just the road and its majesty
And I'm looking at you with the world in the rear view

Chorus
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along

Those white lines get drawn into the sun if you ain't got no one
To keep you hanging on
And there you were like a queen with your nightgown
Riding shotgun from town to town
Staking a claim on the world we found
And I'm singing to you, your singing to me ,you were out of the blue to a boy like me

Chorus
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
And im looking for you in the silence that we share

Chorus
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along


I don't like to be alone in the night
And I don't like to hear
I'm wrong when I'm right
And I don't like to have the rain on my shoes
But I do love you
But I do love you
I don't like to see the sky painted grey
And I don't like when nothing's going my way
And I don't like to be the one with the blues
But I do love you
But I do love you


I love everything about the way you're loving me
The way you lay your head
Upon my shoulder when you sleep
And I love to kiss you in the rain
I love everything you do, oh I do


And I don't like to turn the radio on
Just to find I missed my favorite song
And I don't like to be the last with the news
But I do love you
But I do love you


I love everything about the way you're loving me
The way you lay your head
Upon my shoulder when you sleep
And I love to kiss you in the rain
I love everything you do, oh I do

And I don't like to be alone in the night
And I don't like to hear
I'm wrong when I'm right
And I don't like to have the rain on my shoes
But I do love you

But I do love you
But I do love you
But I do love you

There's a little boy in our neighborhood
His name is Charlie Johnson, and he's really looking good
I had to go and see him, so I called him on the phone
I walked over to his house, and this was going on

His brother was on the sofa, eating chocolate pie
His mama was in the kitchen, cutting chicken up to fry
His daddy was in the backyard, rolling up a garden hose
And I was on the porch with Charlie, feeling love down to my toes

And we were swingin'
Aw yeah, now, we were swingin'
Little Charlie, he's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on his front porch in this swing
Just a-swingin'

Now little Charlie, he's my darling, he's the apple of my eye
And when I'm on the swing with him, it makes me almost high
And Charlie, he's my lover and he has been since the spring
I just can't believe it started on his front porch in this swing
Just a-swingin'
Aw yeah now, baby, swingin'

Oh little Charlie, he's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on this front porch in this swing
Just a-swingin'

On the sofa, eating chocolate pie
In the kitchen, cutting chicken up to fry
In the backyard, rolling up a garden hose
Yeah, feeling love down to my toes
Yeah, he's the apple of my eye
When I'm with him, it makes me almost high
He's been mine since spring on the front porch in his swing
Just a-swingin'
Oh, he was swingin'
Well, he was swingin'
Oh now, we was swingin'

Yeah, little Charlie, he's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on this front porch in this swing
Yeah, just a-swingin'
Swingin'

We don't like to go out shopping
We don't care what's on sale
We just wanna sit with a bag full of chips
Watchin the NFL
When you come over at half time
And say does this dress fit too tight
We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie
And say "uh uh it looks just right"

Well, thats the truth about men
That's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf on our days off
And scratch and spit and cuss

And no matter what line we hand you
When we come dragging in
We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

We hate watchin Steel Magnolias
We like Rambo and Die Hard 4
Jump up and down like fools
When we see the new tools
At the Home Depot store

We don't really wanna take you to dinner
At some fancy resturaunt
The only reason we do is cause
We know it leads too the one thing
That we all want

Well, that's the truth about men
That's the truth about guys
We'd rather pick guitars and work on cars
Then work on the problems in our lives

And though we might say it to you
Every now and then
We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

Well, if you wanna know what we're all thinking
It's nothing to complex
It's just some thing cold for drinking
And a whole lot of S.E.X

Well, that's the truth about men
That's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf and drive around lost
And scratch and spit
And a whole lot of other disgusting stuff

And no matter what line we give you
When we come crawling in
We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen
Sure it's gonna happen
You know it's gonna happen again

And that's the truth about men


Had a nice little life
A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew


There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well


Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet




My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you




Sittin' wide awake in a motel dark
Neon buzzin' in my lonely heart
Wonderin' what you doin', what you wearin' tonight
I wanna be where you are

Oh, I can feel the rhythm of the wheels goin' 'round
I play our song and I turn it up loud
Every turn, every town, every city, every minute
I'm countin' down

Five long days to you I sped
Three thousand miles just to get to the one
Oh, you know you're the one, oh

It's just five more miles, four streets ahead
Three stoplights till I, I get to the one
Oh, you know you're the one, oh

Halfway home, don't know if I can last
Down another cup of coffee, put your picture on my dash
Burnin' both ends and I can't go too fast

Oh, I can feel the rhythm of the wheels goin' 'round
I play our song and I turn it up loud
Every turn, every town, every city, every minute
I'm countin'

Five long days to you I sped
Three thousand miles just to get to the one
Oh, you know you're the one, oh

It's just five more miles, four streets ahead
Three stoplights till I, I get to the one
Oh, you know you're the one, oh

The countdown to you, girl
The countdown to you, oh

Five long days to you I sped
Three thousand miles just to get to the one
Oh, you know you're the one, oh

It's just five more miles, four streets ahead
Three stoplights till I, I get to the one
Oh, you know you're the one, oh

The countdown to you
This is the countdown to you

We were something, you and me
Yeah, we had them rolling in the aisles
We got it right once, didn't we
We had our shot and missed it by a mile
Forget the bitter end
Can you remember when

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet

Passion flows like a long white gown
But it ain't easy to keep your love alive
We hoped each other would come around
We'll use the lessons for better luck next time
But how sweet it was back then
Do you remember when

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw, yeah, we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet


I wish this whiskey would make her miss me
Like I wish she did, I wish she did
Pouring up another one won't change what I should have done
Before she left, now all that's left is


Mile by mile and
City by city she's
Gettin' over me, and man it ain't pretty, no


She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late


I can't take back what I never said
But if I could, man I would
Try and make her see
That me and Tennessee want her back
I wish it worked like that
Yeah


If I had half a clue
Where she was headed now
I'd do what I had to do
To make her turn that car around


She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late


Yeah, I should've held her close
I should've let her know
How I felt about her 'bout a couple county lines ago


She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late


Yeah
I love you too late
I can't take back what I never said
But if I could, damn I would


Would you walk to the edge of the ocean
Just to fill my jar with sand?
Just in case I get the notion
To let it run through my hand
Let it run through my hand


Well, I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just want to be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life


Would you catch a couple thousand fireflies
Yeah, and put them in a lamp to light my world?
All dressed up in a tux and bow tie
Hand delivered to a lonely girl
To a lonely, lonely girl


Well, I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just want to be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life


Lately I've been writing desperate love songs
I mostly sing them to the wall
You could be the center piece of my obsession
If you would notice me at all, yeah


Well, I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just want to be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life


You love all your life
Life
Yeah


I bet you're kicking yourself for letting me walk away
Making yourself a list of the things you wish you didn't say
Sitting by the phone hoping it's gonna ring


Tell me you get lonely when it's cold outside
Tell me that you're only barely getting by
I need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name
It ain't the same without me, girl
Tell me you get lonely


Sometimes you're up all night crying over me
You've gotta take off of work to catch up on your sleep
But that just don't work, now does it, baby


So tell me you get lonely when it's cold outside
Tell me that you're only barely getting by
I need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name
It ain't the same without me, girl
Tell me you get lonely


Tell me you get lonely, and I'll come back
All you've gotta do is call me, my bag's been packed
I'm dying of pride, but I want you to know


That I get lonely when it's cold outside
Baby, I'm only barely getting by
And it still hurts every time that I hear your name
It ain't the same without you, girl
Baby, I get lonely
Yeah, I get lonely
Tell me you get lonely, too
Tell me you get lonely


He was sitting there beside me throwing doubles down
When he ordered up his third one he looked around
Then he looked at me, said I do believe I'll have one more
He said I hate this bar and I hate to drink
But on second thought tonight I think I hate everything


Then he opened up his billfold and threw a 20 down
And the faded photograph fell out and hit the ground
And I picked it up, he said thank you bud, I put it in his hand
He said I probably ought to throw this one away
Cause she's the reason I feel this way, I hate everything


I hate my job, I hate my life and if it weren't for my two kids I'd hate my ex-wife
I know I should move on and try to start again
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him
Then he shook his head and looked down at his ring and said I hate everything


He said one bedroom apartment where I get my mail
Is really not a home, it's more like a jail
With a swimming pool and a parking lot view, man that's just great
I hate summer, winter, fall and spring
Red and yellow, purple, blue and green, I hate everything




So I pulled out my phone and I called my house
I said babe I'm coming home, we're gonna work this out
I paid for his drinks and I told him thanks, thanks for everything


Oh!


Well, judge looked down, gave me forty days
Instead of the fine that I could not pay
Said "Walk right, you'll soon be home
Cross the line, you'll be on your own"


Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis


Well now, whistle blows when the sun comes up
Head to floor, keep your big mouth shut
Eat your breakfast on the ground
Work like hell till the sun goes down


Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis


Well now, ten for the jury, ten for the judge
Twenty more to forget my grudge
When I get to thirty-nine
That's the longest day in a prisoner's mind


Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis


Midnight train to Memphis
Midnight train to Memphis
Oh, Midnight train to Memphis


Get a life, get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break, take control
Take advice from someone you know


Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind


Make a wish, make a move
Make up your mind, you can choose
When you're up, when you're down
When you need a laugh come around


Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind


Oh, oh, oh


Be a winner, be a star
Be happy to be who you are
Got to be yourself, gotta make a plan
Got to go for it while you can


Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind


Get a life, get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break, take control
Take advice from someone you know


Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind


Oh, oh, oh


Dog-tired, yeah, I'm wired
Uptight-er than an a-string about to break
Tail-draggin', a little ragged
Hangin' by a thread that's startin' to fray


Just in case there might be little ears around
I won't say it, I'll just spell it out


I feel like pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point


Hung-over, a lot closer
To ringin' death's door than I was yesterday
Head-achin', hand-shakin'
Badly in need of a shower and shave


Yeah, I know I'm lookin'
A little rough
The least I can do
Is clean my language up


I feel like pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point


I think I partied
A little too hard last night
Let's see here now
How do I put this right?


I feel like pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point


Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Percentage sign, at symbol, back-slash, squiggle-thing
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point


Baby, what are we becoming?
It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions every day
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before


Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby


Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?


Remember when we didn't have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving?
Baby, those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessing everything I see!


Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby


Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?


Baby, do I still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep?
Baby, do I?!


Whoa! Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby


Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Tell me baby, do I get one more try? Do I?
Baby, do I?

(VERSE 1)
We said Yes Maam and Yes Sir, cuz a good whoopin still worked
And if we talked back, we got it again
Back when kids got in fights, they didn't use guns or knives
A bloody nose was as far as it went
And we all ate our suppers with a Daddy and a Mother
At the table without the t.v
Yeah, thats how it was and thats how it still oughtta be

(CHORUS)
Well the world was much safer, you could count on your neighbor
And a stranger was someone you just hadnt met yet
We trusted our preachers, our heroes and teachers
And believed every word that they said

(VERSE 2)
There was no credit crunch and gas wasn't so much
And our jobs hadnt gone overseas
Yeah, thats how it was and thats how it still oughtta be

(CHORUS)
Yeah, the world was much safer, you could cont on your neighbor
And a stranger was someone you just hadnt met yet
We trusted our preachers, our heroes and teachers
And believed every word that they said

(VERSE 3)
We followed the good book, now every time I look back
I sure do like what I see
Yeah, thats how it was and thats how it still oughtta be
Yeah, thats how it was and if youre askin me

I got a city folk friend in a hip-hop world
He goes by E. Diddy but his name is Earl
Cocks his hat to the side in his Grandma's ride
Pumpin' nothin' but bass

He says things like, 'Dawg, are you down with that'
And, 'Don't that fly girl got some back'
And I feel so doggone outta place

When he says
'Holler back when you get back home'
I say, 'The only holler back that I know is'

(Chorus)
In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it good
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds 'a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Let out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta
If you wanna go on back to the holler
Holler back

Take a left off the Interstate
Go ten miles
Take a right on Farm Road 99
And just roll 'til the blacktop ends

'Ya see Mary Jo rockin' that front porch swing
Bikini top and them cut-off jeans
And that's where Hillbilly Heaven begins

Ah, she'll pour 'ya some of that cherry wine
Boy, you're guaranteed to have yourself
One hell of a time
In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it good
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds 'a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Let out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta
If you wanna go on back to the holler
Holler back

In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it so good
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds 'a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Let out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta
If you wanna go on back to the holler
Holler back

(Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds a get sown
Its a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds a get sown)
Ooh...)

It was a Saturday night in a place back just like this
In the laughin' and the dancin', we were havin' one last kiss
There's nothing quite as lonely as a crowd when you're all alone
And there's nothing but Sunday morning waitin' for me at home

So why does everybody love Saturday night
Stale smell of beer and the smoke in your eyes
I keep sittin' and drinkin' and thinkin' 'bout a sad good-bye
So tell me why is everybody so in love with Saturday night

Well hey bartender could you throw those drunk girls out
And don't you think that band's just a little too loud
Tell that couple in the corner to please go get a room
It's a damn good party but what am I supposed to do

Why does everybody love Saturday night
Stale smell of beer and the smoke in your eyes
I keep sittin' and drinkin' and thinkin' 'bout our sad good-bye
So tell me why is everybody so in love with Saturday night

Well she's out there somewhere
With a pretty little dress
A smile in her eyes
'Cause she's one of those who loves Saturday night

Oh why does everybody love Saturday night
Stale smell of beer and the smoke in your eyes
I keep sittin' and drinkin' and thinkin' 'bout our sad good-bye
So tell me why is everybody so in love
Why is everybody so in love
Why is everybody so in love with Saturday night
Oh yeah, Saturday night


Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
Because no matter how far away your roam
If you long for the sunshine and a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home
I met a man who lived in Tennessee
And he was looking for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
Now in Pennsylvania folks are traveling
Down to Dixie's sunny shore
The Atlantic to Pacific
Oh, the season is terrific
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home


I could love you
Baby, if you want me to
I could go and fall for you
And never even try, hey, hey

I could let you in
Baby, where nobody's been
Yeah, I'm ready and willing
To give this love a try, hey, hey


You're the reason why
(Baby you're the only reason why)
Don't want to say goodnight
(Keep kissing me don't want to say goodnight)
Yeah it feels so right
(Everything is going to be alright)
You're the reason why, hey, hey
You're the reason why, hey, hey


You're in my head
Like a song I can't forget
Want to hear it over again
And again hey, hey

Come on and take my hand
I'm ready and willing
Over and over again


It's a hard living, tail kicking
Trip that we're on, but I'm beting
We can find a little sunshine in the night
It's a back breaking, soul taking
Road we walk, so what are we waiting for
Baby let's turn off the lights
Cause girl there's just not enough love in the world


So we should make a little
Generate a little
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
We could turtle dove, Dixieland delight
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
It all comes down to you and me girl
There's just not enough love in the world
So we should make a little
Then make a little more tonight


It's a clock punching, cash crunching
And it all adds up to nothing
If you're in this thing long
So don't tease me, it's so easy
To just turn off the TV and make some headlines of our own
Yeah girl, there's just not enough love in the world


So we should make a little
Conjugate a little
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
We could turtle dove, Dixieland delight
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
It all comes down to you and me girl
There's just not enough love in the world
So we should make a little
Then make a little more tonight
That's right

Yeah girl there's not enough love in the world


So we should make a little
Consummate a little
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
We could turtle dove, Dixieland delight
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
It all comes down to you and me girl
There's just not enough love in the world
So we should make a little
Then make a little more
We should make a little
Then make a little more
We should make a little
Then make a little more tonight

Talk about loving all night

Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Winter wonderland

Wonderland, Yeah
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows
Ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play
The Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
Yeah, we're walking in a winter
Yeah, we're walking in a winter
We're walking in a winter wonderland

Wonderland
Winter wonderland...

Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again
And it's like you haven't been
Gone a moment from my sight
Like the tears were never cried
Like the hands of time were holding you and me

And with all my heart I'm sure
We're closer than we ever were
I don't have to hear or see
I've got all the proof I need
There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Now when you die, your life goes on
It doesn't end here when you're gone
Every soul is filled with light
It never ends, if I'm right
Our love can even reach across eternity
I believe
Oh, I believe

Forever, you're a part of me
Forever in the heart of me
I would hold you even longer if I can
Oh, the people who don't see the most

See that I believe in ghosts
If that makes me crazy, then I am
'Cause I believe
Oh, I believe

There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again
And I believe


Wiped the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that "ya'll come back" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear


It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town


I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new


It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town


It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say


It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town


Stop starin' at the rearview
You ain't checkin' your hair
That wheel has spun and them lights are out
There ain't nothin' for you back there
Stop holdin' on so dang tight, 'bout time you let go
But he's a heart breakin', let you down, son-of-a-gun
But I ain't sayin' nothin' you don't know


The day you stop lookin' back
You're gonna find that the future
Sure beats the hell outta the past
Now he ain't no good
I guess he's good as gone
The day you stop lookin' back, girl yeah
Is the day you start movin' on


That sun's gonna come up
It's gonna feel good
And after all the rain and pain you've seen
I hope you soak it up like you should
Now and then it's gonna stir up
When you hear that old song
But don't let it get to ya baby
It's only three and a half minutes long
Well


The day you stop lookin' back
You're gonna find that the future
Sure beats the hell outta the past
Now he ain't no good
I guess he's good as gone
The day you stop lookin' back, girl yeah
Is the day you start movin' on


Is the day you start movin' on
You ain't checkin' your hair
That wheel is spun and them lights are out
There ain't nothin' for you back there

All the lights are goin' down on Main Street
Parkin' lots are fillin' up
With teenage dreams an' pick-up trucks
There's gonna be a race tonight:
That's where I'm gonna catch your eye
Right across that finish line is where I'll make you mine

An' if it's crazy to think, maybe
All you need is a love that's true
Well then, baby, you can call me crazy
'Cause I do

This ol' GTO can't go no faster
There's only two ways out tonight:
Winnin' or disaster
Ain't nothin' but dust in my rear view
Oh, everybody's cheerin', baby
But all I want is you

And if it's crazy to think, maybe
All you need is a love that's true
Well then, baby, you can call me crazy
'Cause I do

An' after the smoke has settled on this town
You're gonna know why true love won't back down
'Cause when wild hairs have turned to grey
I still will feel this way

And if it's crazy to think, maybe
All you need is a love that's true
Then call me crazy
'Cause I do

You can call me crazy
Ah, you can call me crazy
You can call me crazy

I've found piece of mind
I'm feeling good again
I'm on the other side
Back among the living
Ain't a cloud in the sky
All my tears have been cried
And I can finally say

Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone

I still love you
And I will forever
We can't hide the truth
We know each other better
When we try to make it work
We both end up hurt
Love ain't supposed to be that way

Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone

When we try to make it work
We both end up hurt
Love ain't supposed to be that way

So Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
Oh, In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone

I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone...

I'm for wildflowers in the window
Mechanics you can trust
I'm for crackers in my chili
And leavin' grudges in the dust

I'm for drive thru order takers
Who can muster up a smile
I'm for takin' in that stray dog
That's been hangin' 'round for awhile

I'm for turning off the TV
Gettin' off the internet
I'm for learning all the words
To the Gettysburg Address

I'm for dusty pawn shop guitars
And boxers passed their prime
I'm for soakin' up the wisdom
When an old man speaks his mind

I'm for laid off factory workers
When the wolf is at the door
You don't have to guess what I'm against
If you know what I'm for

I'm for Texas Margaritas
Gettin' outta debt
I'm for havin' faith in something
That hasn't happened yet

For the shy kid in the corner
Afraid to ask the girl to dance
For the ex-con outta prison
Who just wants a second chance

For the inner city teacher
With her heart stuck in her throat
Can still see God in every child
And never gives up hope

I'm for dusty pawn shop guitars
And boxers passed their prime
I'm for soakin' up the wisdom
When and old man speaks his mind

I'm for Detroit factory workers
When the wolf is at the door
You don't have to guess what I'm against
If you know what I'm for

I'm counting all my blessings
When the wolf is at my door
You don't have to ask what I'm against
You don't have to guess what I'm against


There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but


Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day


You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home


Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard, or it’s wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day


Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you


Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere


There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore


Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day


Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you


Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)


She's getting dressed up, putting on that lipstick
Shimmy shakeing, right into them cutoffs baby, oh yeah
You're getting off work, cashing out that paycheck
Gotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step
Here she comes now lookin' so fine
You've been waiting on this night for such a long, long time


She slides in and you roll down Main Street
You turn right when that red light turns green
Sun sets now, you're half way to heaven
She picks a song, you turn it up to 11
You say, "Do you wanna?" and she says, "Hell, yeah"
So you hit the party, all your buddies are jealous
Someday you'll be looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights


Crowded backyard, everybody's laughin'
Kinda party, next week you'll say I was there when it happened
Coming up on midnight, 'bout time to get gone
And then the DJ starts to play your favorite song
You slow dance for 3 minutes or so, and then she whispers, "Baby, let's go."


And when she slides in and she gives you the green light
You hold off 'till you turn on the headlights
Someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights


Full moon through a crack in the windshield
You hold her close and you'll never forget how her heartbeat feels
No, you never will
'Cause someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights


Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights, oh
One of those nights
This is gonna be, hey
This is gonna be
One of those nights
Oh, oh

She left out of Leeville
When she was seventeen
Headed down to South Texas
In a broken down machine
With all she had
Left her Momma cryin' and her Daddy mad

When she wore her hair up
She could pass for 21
Brown eyes and red lipstick
She could sure leave a man undone
She wouldn't be back
She'd leave 'em all reelin' in the aftermath
Singing...

Chorus:
Freedom
Is a windshield full of stars and a radio
Tires squealin'
With Saint Christopher barely hangin' on
La da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da
La da da da da

She was down at the Offshore Lounge
Singin' in the bar
She sang Patsy Cline like you never heard
And filled up her mason jar
With just enough cash
To take herself a little further on down the map, yeah
Singing...

Chorus

Bridge:
Another heart, another time
Another town she'll leave behind

La da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da


Tuxedo waiters, black tie
White table cloths and red wine
We've been planning, this night
Looking forward to it, for some time


Now honey I know you love gettin' dressed up
And you know I love showin' you off
But watchin' your baby blue eyes
Dancin' in the candle light glow
All I can think about, is gettin' you home


Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Uh, honey, there sure ain't nothin', like you lovin' me all night long
And all I can think about is gettin' you home


I don't need this menu, no I don't
I already know just what I want
Did I hear you right, did you tell me
Go pay the waiter and lets leave


Now honey I know by that look in your eyes
And your hand drawin' hearts on mine
That our night out of the house, ain't gonna last too long
When all you can think about, is gettin' me home


Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Uh, honey, there sure ain't nothin', like you lovin' me all night long
And all I can think about, is gettin' you home


Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Uh, honey, there sure ain't nothin' like you loving me all night long
And all I can think about, all I can think about
All I can think about, is gettin' you home

How'd you know to wear your hair like that?
How'd you know to turn up that song?
How'd you know them little tore up jeans
Was gonna tear me up and turn me on?
Girl, it's like you know me too good
But you barely know me at all
Yeah, the way it's going tonight
You probably know I'm ready to fall cause

Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader
Yeah, that's what you are
You play it off a little shy but baby, you're a heart stealer
And right here in this car
It's like you know that smile was gonna melt me down
Like you know those lips are what I'm needing right now
And girl when you lay 'em on mine
Yeah, it's like you're reading my mind
(Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader)

Girl it's like you got a crystal ball
Like you got a little gypsy side
It's like you knew that sweet perfume
That you got on was gonna get me high
Well how'd you know what I'm thinking right now?
How'd you know what I was about to say?
How'd you know to whisper in my ear
Let's take this party back to my place

Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader
Yeah, that's what you are
You play it off a little shy but baby, you're a heart stealer
And right here in this car
It's like you knew that smile was gonna melt me down
Like you know those lips are what I'm needing right now
And girl when you lay 'em on mine
Yeah, it's like you're reading my mind
Yeah, that's what you are

It's like you knew just when to lean on in
And take my hand like you had it all planned
And girl you've got me figured out, don't ya now?

Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader
Yeah, that's what you are
You play it off a little shy but baby, you're a heart stealer
And right here in this car
It's like you knew that smile was gonna melt me down
Like you know those lips are what I'm needing right now
And girl when you lay 'em on mine
Yeah, it's like you're reading my mind
(Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader)
Yeah, that's what you are
(Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader)
Ohh, it's you girl

Looks like everybody's here
Had to put some foldin' chairs in the vestibule
Yeah, it's gettin' full
Even old Aunt Ruby came
Her first time on an airplane
It's her sister's girl
She wouldn't miss it for the world

Pre Chorus

And all them kids jumpin' in the pews
And Mr. Charlie in his lime-green suit
'Is a handsome man'
Remarks Widow Callahan
Uncle Joe and Uncle Jake
Haven't spoken since '98
Just said, 'Hello'
It's a good day to let it go

Chorus

So let the angels gather
Let the music play
Let the preacher get to preachin' all the "do you take"'s
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limosine
Love is a beautiful thing

2nd Verse

Daddy's waitin' with the bride
Yeah, she helps him with his tie
She sees a tear
He says, 'Man, it's hot in here' hmm
He hugs his little girl and asks
'How did you grow up so fast?
God, I wish your Momma could be here for this'

Pre Chorus

And everybody stands and smiles
As she goes walkin' down the aisle
In her Momma's gown
And Daddy breaks on down
Gran and Gramps in the second row
Stood right there fifty years ago
And said their vows
Yeah, I guess it's workin' out

(Repeat Chorus)
Bridge

A little table full'a gifts
Catering's covered dish
And the wedding band
Well, that's on her hand
And Tommy's teasin' Lorelei
He pushed her down and made her cry
And neither one knows
A day will come

Tag Chorus

When the angels gather
And the music plays
And the preacher gets to preachin' all the "do you take"'s
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limosine
Love
Two people in love is a beautiful thing

First time I heard, Good Hearted Woman
I was in my uncle's car
He said, son, now that's what I call music
Listen to them guitars, turn it up, go on, turn it up

He said, forget that crap you're listenin' to
These songs, they got some meat
I don't think I heard a single word
'Cause I was caught up in the beat

Yeah, I turned it up
I turned it way up, yeah

An' it was wild guitar, it was loud and hard
Some hill billy rock an' roll
It was somethin' new, breakin' all the rules
Man, I could feel it down in my soul

It was Waylon and Willie playin' Chet an' Cash
And takin' the country back
Yeah, times were tough and it was hard to find a job
Well, '79 was a good year for the outlaw, yeah

All right

Well, it was somethin' like five years later
I finally got my license to drive
I was huggin' the kerb, first time I heard
A Country Boy Can Survive

And I turned it up
Yeah, I turned it way up

And it was wild guitars, it was loud and hard
Some kinda hill billy rock and roll
It was somethin' new, breakin' all the rules
But you could feel it down in your soul

He was the son of the original son of a gun
Takin' the country back
The economy was the worst you ever saw
Yeah, but '85 was a good year for the outlaw, son

Turn it up
Who? C'mon
Yeah

Now somewhere in some honky tonk
You don't even know his name
Some young upstart just startin' up
An' he's wantin' to make a change
He says, turn it up, CC12


I got a funny feelin'
The moment that your lips touched mine
Somethin' shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity


You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again


Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancin' is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
Quite the way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know


You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
And we'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

They don't ask cause they know I'll say
It ain't nothin' just another woman done walked away
Still on track, no I ain't fazed
I rock on all night long just playing this masquerade

Well, I've got everybody thinkin' I'm superman strong
But that big ole "S" ain't on my chest at night when I get home
One look at my reflection and lonely's all I see
I can tell 'em all I'm glad you're gone
But the truth is I can't lie to me

Call you up and get shot down
Throw my pride aside and I just cry out loud
Called my bluff, now just look at me
A fool in love and all tore up
Down here on my knees

Well, I've got everybody thinkin' I'm superman strong
But that big ole "S" ain't on my chest at night when I get home
One look at my reflection and lonely's all I see
I can tell 'em all I'm glad you're gone
But the truth is I can't lie to me

Oh the truth is I can't lie to me

Wind blowin' on my face
Sidewalk flyin' beneath my bike
A five year-old's first taste
Of what freedom's really like
He was runnin' right beside me
His hand holdin' on the seat
I took a deep breath and hollered
As I headed for the street

You can let go now, Daddy
You can let go
Oh, I think I'm ready
To do this on my own
It's still a little bit scary
But I want you to know
I'll be ok now, Daddy
You can let go

I was standin' at the altar
Between the two loves of my life
To one I've been a daughter
To one I soon would be a wife
When the preacher asked
‘Who gives this woman?'
Daddy's eyes filled up with tears
He kept holdin' tightly to my arm
‘Till I whispered in his ear

You can let go now, Daddy
You can let go
Oh, I think I'm ready
To do this on my own
It still feels a little bit scary
But I want you to know
I'll be ok now, Daddy
You can let go

It was killin' me to see
The strongest man I ever knew
Wastin' away to nothin'
In that hospital room
‘You know he's only hangin' on for you'
That's what the night nurse said
My voice and heart were breakin'
As I crawled up in his bed, and said

You can let go now, Daddy
You can let go
Your little girl is ready
To do this on my own
It's gonna be a little bit scary
But I want you to know
I'll be ok now, Daddy
You can let go
You can let go




I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside, I couldn't get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone


I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house


See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back but people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone


I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house


The flames are getting bigger now
In this burning house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burning house
Oh, and I don't want to wake up
In this burning house


I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

It's gettin' hard to see the road
Rain drownin' out the radio
One wiper doin' double time
Coffee cold, gas is low

The miles keep getting me nowhere
She's there no matter where I go
And the night keeps comin' on
Yeah, the night keeps comin' on

Sometimes, you gotta pull the car over
To the side of the highway
Break down, kill the motor and cry
Sometimes, you gotta try to keep livin'
Put the key in the ignition
And start your life over again

A thousand wheels flyin' by
Headin' down the interstate
Everybody's got a place to go
All I do is sit and wait

For some kind of resurrection
From a love that feels more like hate
And you can't get back what's gone
No, you can't get back what's gone

Sometimes, you gotta pull the car over
To the side of the highway
Break down, kill the motor and cry
Sometimes, you gotta try to keep livin'
Put the key in the ignition
And start your life over again

And you can't get back what's gone
No, you can't get back what's gone

Sometimes, you gotta pull the car over
To the side of the highway
Break down, kill the motor and cry
You gotta try to keep livin'
Put the key in the ignition
And start your life over again

Sometimes, you gotta try to keep livin'
Put the key in the ignition
Put the key in the iginition
And start your life over again


This the season for generosity
A time to give and to receive
My Christmas list consists of just one sweet dream


I know what I want for Christmas this year
I hope my note got to Santa on time
I'm a little bit nervous
It's kind of a big thing I'm asking for
I don't know if I deserve it but, boy, if I get it
I'll never ask for anything more
It shines, it's new
And it's the one wish that I wish would come true
This year for Christmas I just want to be with you


We can build a little fire
We can sit and talk for hours
We'll just have fun
You can tell me what you did
Christmas morning as a kid
And we'll talk about all our Christmases to come


And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway
I'm sure to get a kiss
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow
To complete this singular wish?
It shines, it's new
I know what I want and nothing else will do
This year for Christmas I just want to be with you


This year for Christmas I just want to be with you


A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water; we were feeling alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side


Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night


Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song


Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night


(Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night
(Whoa-oh)
A barefoot, blue jean night
(Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night
A barefoot, blue jean night
It's a barefoot, blue jean night
A barefoot, blue jean night


My first best friend was a 6 string
Took him with me everywhere I go
When I was 18, bought a Dodge van
Found a drummer and made the road my home


Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today


My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home


Every Friday, you could find me
At Dixie Tavern, playing with my band
We'd start the show with a round of whiskey
And play our hearts out and wished it'd never end


Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today


My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home


We'd get 'em singing "Don't Stop Believing"
Then follow up with a cold beer on a Friday night
Always dreaming one day we'd play with
All our heroes we cover every night


Flying high all our dreams came true
You've given me wings


And roots, always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home
My roots, always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
My roots, even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home


Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only gives you stronger roots

I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
The ones that look like Santa Claus
Christmas trees, and bells, and stars
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe

Now Christmas cookies are a special treat
The more she bakes the more I eat
And sometimes I can't get myself to stop
Sometimes she'll wait till I'm asleep
And she'll take the ones I didn't eat
And put those little sprinkly things on top

I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
The ones that look like Santa Claus
Christmas trees, and bells, and stars
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe

Now those sprinkly things just makes things worse
Cause it makes them taste better than they did at first
And they're absolutely impossible to resist
Some disappear to who knows where
But I make sure I get my share
And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss

I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
She gets mad that they're all gone
Before she gets the icing put on
Sure do like those Christmas cookies babe

Now there's a benefit to all of this
That you might have overlooked or missed
So now let me tell you the best part of it all
Every time she sticks another batch in the oven
There's 15 minutes for some kissin' and'a huggin'
That's why I eat Christmas cookies all year long!

Ah, Take it away boys

I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
The ones that look like Santa Claus
Christmas trees, and bells, and stars
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe

I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe...


Times were rough when times were lean
Most the time nobody seemed to care
No more peace than a southern breeze
Whistling through the willow trees
And I see you standing there
And I reach out to touch your face
But the cold hard facts of life put me in my place


Southern rain falling down on me
Thinking back to yesterday and the way things used to be
Sweet home on the radio why do things have to change
Oh Lord what I would not give to feel that southern rain


Watermelon growing on the vine
The sweet taste of homemade wine
And the soft touch of your fingertips
Laying' down by the riverside
Do you recall how we used to hide
So I could taste your lips
Though the winds of change took me from home
So many years just passed me by and now I'm all alone




You said that we could last forever
But I had my wild oats yet to sow
Through every storm and each endeavor
The past and the love we found just will not let me go




Oh Lord what I would not give to feel that southern southern rain
Oh to feel that southern southern rain
Oh to feel that southern southern rain
Oh to feel that southern southern rain
Southern southern rain


Couldn't wait to turn 16 and drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel was all I could think about
A little rust in the bed of that truck and a four speed on the floor
Five-hundred dollars it was mine, all mine and I never wanted nothing more


I took Katie down by the river with a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool trying' to play it cool hoping' she'd let me cross the line
I was praying that she couldn't tell I never been that far before
The first time's a one time feeling and I never wanted nothing more
No I never wanted nothing more..


Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need


My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told them that I'd thought it through
Katie laughed and my mama cried when they heard me say "I do"
Her little ring is a little thing, but its all I could afford
Now she's mine, all mine till the day I die, and I never wanted nothing more


Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need


One Sunday I listened to the preacher and I knew he was preaching to me
I couldn't help it I walked up front and I got down on my knees
Right then and there, I swear I changed when I found the Lord
Glory Hallelujah, good God almighty I never wanted nothing more


Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need


Never wanted nothing more
And I never wanted nothing more


I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white
So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose
Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else


Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:


Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two


Well
It won't be whiskey, it won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart


So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:


Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
Dig two


I took your name when I took those vows
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now
Oh, right now


If the ties that bind ever do come loose
If forever ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
You might as well read me my last rites
And let the stone say:


Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh!
There'll be a stone right next to mine
We'll be together 'til the end of time
Don't you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two


I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead


I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me


But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours


I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again


But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours


I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea


I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours


Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours


Completely complacent
So excitedly vacant
I keep waiting for something to give
But that something is always me
You consume what your able
I get crumbs from your table
You call this comfortably normal
But i call it getting by


Baby its a fine line
I am holding on your holding back
Baby its a fine line
Can't you hear it knocking at your door
But your taking your sweet time
In love and out of touch yeah
Baby its a fine line
Baby its a real fine line


Do you feel the distance
Like i feel resistance
If i pull any farther away
Would you even come after me
But the one thing I am fearing
Is I am disappearing
How can i keep believing
If you won't prove me wrong



Oooooooh oooooooh
Oooooh oooooooh




Long legged women, velvet and lace
A country boy can't help but stare at your face
And I like your outlaw attitude
And I like that long black car
I might just be your ticket out of this old high browed bar
I don't care who you are
Throw me the keys, honey take a seat
I'll show you how to drive that thing
Ride shotgun, with a bootleg sun
Sure to make a city girl scream


I'm gone take you places money don't go
I'm gone teach you what a country boy know
Gonna cover you in diamonds and dust
Where the stars fall on moonshine road


Roll down that window
Let down your fancy hair
Your a long way from New Orleans
Now nobody 'round here cares
Oh, can't you smell that jasmine
Hanging in the air
That's the ghost of old plantations
That burn the hell out there
Ya girl where almost there
Hold on tight, here come the ride
This is where the blacktop ends
Gonna loose those lights, a running blind
You'll never be the same again




Long legged women, velvet and lace
A country boy can't help but stare at your face, at your pretty face


Come on
Throw me them keys, let me show you what that caddy'll do baby
Come on

This is gonna hurt, this is gonna hurt like hell
This is gonna damn near kill me, sometimes the truth ain't easy
I know that you're scared of telling me something
I don't wanna hear, but baby believe that
I'm not leaving, you couldn't give me one good reason

Love don't run, love don't hide
It won't turn away or back down from a fight
Baby I'm right here and I ain't going anywhere
Love's too tough it won't give up no not on us
Baby Love don't run

Let's lay it on the line, I don't care if it takes all night cuz
This is gonna makes us stronger, it's gonna make forever longer
I know it'd be easier walking away but what we got is real
And I wanna save us, baby we can do it, Baby we'll get through it cause

Love don't run, love don't hide
It won't turn away or back down from a fight
Baby I'm right here and I ain't going anywhere

Baby Love don't run
Baby love don't run

So come over here and lay down in my arms
Baby tell me everything that's on your heart, cause

Baby I'm right here and I ain't going anywhere
Love's too tough it won't give up no not on us
Baby Love don't run
Baby Love don't run


Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Packed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you


M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move


It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you


M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
And I can't move when you move


Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love it when you, love it when you feel the beat
C-O-M-E
Come on, I wanna see you


Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playing throwback tunes
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No, I can't move when you move
No, I can't move when you move


I'm going to take that mountain


I was born a stubborn soul
I'm not afraid of the great unknown
Or a winding road that's all uphill
This is just a stumbling block
Intimidating wall of rock
If you think this broken heart will break my will


I'm going to take that mountain
There's nothing going to slow me down
And there is no way around it
Going to leave it level with the ground
I'm not just going to cross it, climb it, fight it
I'm going to take that mountain


It's overwhelming looking up
I know when it's the challenge of
Me against this heartache to survive
I may slip and I may fall
But even if I have to crawl
I'll break through to the healing side




I'm not just going to cross it, climb it, fight it




I was born a stubborn soul
This is a stumbling block
I'm going to take that mountain

She's 34
Two years divorced
Sick of being bored
About to throw that saddle back on that horse

He's 39
Way past his prime
Came out of retirement
Everybody said he done lost his mind

They look at him now
Packing in that crowd
Just one more touchdown
And he's Super Bowl bound

It ain't over
'Til you say it is
Don't pour out your Coca-Cola
If it's still got a little bit of fizz

Little bit of hop left in that frog
Little bit of bark left in that dog
There might not be a lot of roll
Left in that stone

Still a little chicken left on that bone

That GTO
It might be old
But truth be told
Underneath that rust is a heart of gold

It's a fixer-upper
Every night after supper
He'll twist and yank and make it crank
Until that thing burns rubber

But it ain't over
'Til you say it is
Don't pour out your Coca-Cola
If it's still got a little bit of fizz

Little bit of juke left in that jive
Little bit of honey left in that hive
There might not be a lot of roll
Left in that stone

Still a little chicken left on that bone

Get some dust on them boots
Kick the rust off the bucket
What you got to lose?
Nothin'

No, it ain't over
'Til you say it is
Don't pour out your Coca-Cola
If it's still got a little bit of fizz

Little bit of tick left in that tock
Little bit of click left in that clock
There might not be a lot of roll
Left in that stone

Still a little chicken left on that bone


That ol' sun comes up every mornin'
And goes back down at the end of every day
It's just that way
Stars show up every evenin'
Man in the moon comes out to play
It's just that way


And girl, lovin' you is something I was born to do
It's just that way


The oceans wet the deserts dry
Don't ask me why, 'cause I can't say
It's just that way
As sure as the world keeps turnin'
My love for you will never change
Oh, it's just that way


And girl, lovin' you is something I was born to do
It's just that way


That ol' sun comes up every mornin', it's just that way


Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red


Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red


Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red


Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red


And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah


His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street


Me and daddy'd ride around all day shooting doves off a line in a Chevrolet
Old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up
We would drive for miles and miles and never once hit blacktop or change the dial
One little country station was all there was
Checking gates, fixing fence and roads
That is how my story goes


If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It's right there for you to see
Every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Riding round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary


I remember when I turned sixteen; I got a license and some gasoline
There's no curve or a straight away we didn't fly down
It was not the boys, it was me and her by fire in a field or down by the river
Every inch of that county was sacred ground
Wish I knew where that old truck was
If it could talk, it could tell about us


If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It's right there for you to see
Every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Riding round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary


It's not a book underneath my bed
Just a dusty memory lane in my head


Tan legs and some Dixie land delight, riding round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diaries
Just ride around this little town and you will see how I wrote my dirt road diary

Sun coming up over New York City
School bus driver in a traffic jam
Starin' at the faces in her rearview mirror
Looking at the promise of the Promised Land
One kid dreams of fame and fortune
One kid helps pay the rent
One could end up going to prison
One just might be president

Only in America
Dreaming in red, white and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Sun going down on an LA freeway
Newlyweds in the back of a limousine
A welder's son and a banker's daughter
All they want is everything
She came out here to be an actress
He was the singer in a band
They just might go back to Oklahoma
And talk about the stars they could have been

Only in America
Dreaming in red, white and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Only in America
Where we dream in red, white and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Yeah only in America
Only in America
Where we dream in red, white and blue
Yeah we dream as big as we want to
Only in America

If you don't like me brother that’s okay
I ain't gonna let it wreck my day
I keep stylin’, smilin’
Handin’ out the sunshine

Damn, it feels good to be me
Seats laid back in my Cutlass Supreme

Fresh pair of kicks and my old blue jeans

Her Daddy gave her first pony
Then told her to ride
She climbed high in that saddle
Fell I don't know how many times
Taught her a lesson that she learned
Maybe a little too well


Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry


She grew up
She got married
Never was quite right
She wanted a house, a home and babies
He started coming home late at night
She didn't let him see it break her heart
She didn't let him see her fall apart




Phone rang early one morning
Her momma's voice, she'd been crying
Said it's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dying
She laid the phone down by his head
The last words that he said




I heard Davey Crockett had a pint in his pocket
Good whiskey at the Alamo
Now that Pancho Villia, had a jug of Tequila
When he walked the streets of old Mexico
While Blackbeard was fleecing around the hurricane season
He didn’t quit because of a girl
Yeah, rum is the reason pirates never ruled the world


While Russia was brawling
I bet that Old Stalin was calling for a vodka martini
While the world waited in fear
Old Hitler drank beer from a stein, eating sauerkraut and weenies
Yeah, down through the ages, as they turned their pages
They couldn’t drink their diamonds and pearls
No, rum is the reason pirates never ruled the world


I ain’t getting much done but I’m having fun
Sailing on the deep blue sea
My whole body goes numb from a bottle of dark rum
And the sun sinking down on me
My catch of the day is a tall Cuba Libra
Chased down with a 12 ounce Curl
Yeah, rum is the reason pirates never ruled the world


I ain’t getting much done but I’m having fun
Sailing on the deep blue sea
My whole body goes numb from a bottle of dark rum
And the sun sinking down on me
My catch of the day is a tall Cuba Libra
Chased down with a 12 ounce Curl
Yeah, rum is the reason i guess
Yeah, rum is the reason pirates never ruled the world


Take it home coral reefers, haha…
Woo
Yeah


Old boy at the bar with the stagger in his step
Looks like he's been rode hard and put up wet
Heartache's on him like stink on a skunk
He's fightin' off lonely, tryin' to drown it with a drunk


Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock


Yeah, think he's still a little green, ya'll, he's fresh off the farm
Some pretty little thing put a whoopin' on his heart
He's walkin' to the left, leanin' to the right
Talkin' to himself, puttin' up a fight


Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock


He needs a long rope, boys, cut him some slack
Every now and then you gotta act like that


Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock


Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock


Talk on the phone, stare at the screen
Doing' the job, living the dream
Getting paid
Yeah right
Thinking about what I'll say to prove
That we should go out for a laugh or two
Instead of going home tonight


'Been a long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?


Happy hour's like a holiday
Hanging with you's like getting away
Let's conversate
For a little while
Well, keep me company, catch me up
It's a whole lot better than being stuck
In a drive-time 9 to 5
I'd rather see you smile


A long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?


'Been a long day
And the boss don't get it
Don't you wanna take the edge off
With some 7 and 7?
Just crushing' on a friend
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
Sipping' and tipping' some drinks after work?


A long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?
Long day
No break
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
Have a little drink after work?
Sipping' and tipping' some drinks after work?

Hearts and flowers, forget love letters
Pain and anger, forget forgiveness
Love ain't waiting for a guy like me

Debutants and champaign, diamonds and cocaine
I ain't the son of outrageous fortune
Cash ain't status for a guy like me

Put me on a cool river
Take my worries from me
Fly me high on a big blue sky
Well, there's no one here but me, just me

Long black limousine, pictures in magazines
All night parties, beautiful people
No super model for a guy like me

I'm just a good man, I work with my hands
I get the picture, I heard the message
Hell ain't waiting for a guy like me

Put me on a cool river
Take my sins from me
Fly me high ov'r a big blue sky
Where there's no one here but me

Put me on a cool river
Take my pain from me
Fly me high ov'r a big blue sky
Where there's no one here but me, just me
Yeah, just me

Hearts and flowers, forget love letters
Pain and anger, forget forgiveness
Love ain't waiting for a guy like me

So put me on a cool river
Take my worries from me
Fly me high ov'r a big blue sky
Where there's no one here but me

Put me on a cool river
Take my worries from me
Fly me high ov'r a big blue sky
Where there's no one here but me, just me
Yeah, just me


You're gonna run out of cigarettes
And we're gonna run out of wine
We haven't even started the good stuff yet
It's OK, we've got plenty of time
So pull up a comfortable chair, baby
And put on those records that drive me crazy
You look so good in this light
Oh yeah, you look like nothing but mine


I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
Til the very last second, last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Oh, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again


Let's make this night last forever
Like honey dripping sweet and slow
Every kiss just tasting better
Every touch, every whisper, let go


I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
Til the very last second, last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Yeah, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
Ooh, yeah
I wanna love you like the rain on a roof
Stronger than a bottle of 110 proof
I wanna take love to places that love has never been
Yeah, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
And I'll love you again
Oh, and again


Pour me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Pour me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before


Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on


I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)


Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialling no more at 3am
Mr. Bartender hittin' me again


Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on


I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
Oh, see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)


Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back


I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof

(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
Oh, see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)
Yeah


(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)
Yeah


When you lose something
It’s all that you want back
You’re waiting patiently
But it don’t work like that

When you lose someone
The first thing that goes through your head
Is if you run fast enough
You just might catch up
But it don’t work like that


You just got to watch it fly
Stand there on the side lines
Go on and swallow your pride
You know its going to be alright
Wish it well and close your eyes
With a kiss goodbye


Well the hardest part
Ya it hurts so bad
Is when she spreads her wings
But it’d be a selfish thing
To try and hold her back
But it don’t work like that



When you lose something
It’s all that you want back




Like a kiss goodbye


I'm Jason Aldean. This week we witnessed one of the worst tragedies in American history. Like everyone, I'm struggling to understand what happened that night and how to pick up the pieces and heal. So many are hurting. There are children, parents, brothers, sisters, friends. They're all part of our family. So I wanna say to them: we hurt for you, and we hurt with you. But you can be sure that we're gonna walk through these tough times together every step of the way. Because when America is at its best, our bond, and our spirit it's unbreakable


Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down


No, I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down


(I won't back down)
Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down)
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down


Well I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I'll stand my ground
And I won't back down


(I won't back down)
Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down)
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down)
Hey, I won't back down
(I won't back down)
Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down)
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
No, we won't back down

He was a bad boy
And i was a good girl
He needed me to smooth out the edges
Well he'd get his drink on and flirt with the ladies
And after two years of his crap i quit beggin'
Im a magnet for the fixer upper man
If i know that it's fire do i let it burn my hand?

*Chorus*

Cupid works for the devil be suspicious if he cries
You know sex is usually good yeah but it ain't always right
Chocolate is a bandaid no matter what they say
Shoes don't stretch, and men don't change

My friend lisa, she loves a liar
She found out about his other girlfriends
He makes excuses so she forgives him
And she swears she's gonna leave if he screws up again
But he's good lookin that's why she don't see
He's got her exactly where he wants her to be

*Chorusx2*

Sex is usually good
Shoes dont stretch
Men dont change


Well I see the souls of so many friends
And I see us all back here again
With sandy floors and ceiling fans
A Rastafarian one-man band with songs
That fills my memories like a tip jar
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar


I see tourists at Christmas time
And I taste beers with a hint of lime
I feel lonely because it's not the same
Different faces and different names
Living like pirates out among the stars
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar


Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place


And I see a kid coming into his own
And a man learning to move on
Somehow trying to find his way
A dreamer betting on blind faith
Chasing that sun and following his heart
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar


Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place


A few have moved on back to Maine
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne
Some are still living the dream
Stuck in still life it seems
No matter where they've been
Or where they are
Yeah, I see them here
When I see this bar
When I see this bar


I wonder where we go from here
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
Life isn't over but it's always near
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
I think about all the good times that we had
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
It makes me happy and it makes me sad
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
How could we be so close, now so far apart
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
That's what I feel, that's what I see
Yeah we were living like pirates and want to be stars
That's what I see when I see this bar


That's what I see when I see this bar

Well it might be me, might be the whiskey
We might be loving, we might be tipsy
Tomorrow morning might hurt real bad
So lets make tonight last…

We’ve been hanging around this place (hanging around)
Hanging on to the hope and the way this whiskey tastes (whiskey tastes)
Waiting, Wishing that you’d say
“Hell with being sober, I wanna hangover tonight”
It’s getting stronger (stronger), how can this be wrong girl (wrong girl)
All night long, girl, I wanna hangover tonight

Well I might make a move and it might be risky
I’ll take one more shot if you’ll take one with me
Get a little closer in a cab outside
Lets take a ride (ride with me baby)

We’ve been hanging around this place (hanging around)
Hanging on to the hope and the way this whiskey tastes (oh yeah)
Waiting, Wishing that you’d say
“Hell with being sober, I wanna hangover tonight” (hangover, hangover)
Feeling’s getting stronger (stronger), how can this be wrong girl
All night long, girl, I wanna hangover tonight
Feeling’s getting stronger (stronger), how can this be wrong girl
All night long, girl, I wanna hangover tonight. (hangover…)

Can’t get enough of you (Enough of you, enough of you)
I want too much of you (much of you, much of you)
I wanna feel you closer, Yeah, I want to hangover

That hangover…

We’ve been hanging around this place (hanging around)
Hanging on to the hope and the way this whiskey tastes (whiskey tastes)
Waiting, Wishing that you’d say
“Hell with being sober, I wanna hangover tonight”
Feeling’s getting stronger (stronger), how can this be wrong girl
All night long, girl, I wanna hangover tonight
Feeling’s getting stronger, how can this be wrong girl
All night long, girl, I wanna hangover tonight. (I wanna feel you closer)

I wanna hangover tonight
I wanna hangover tonight
I want too much of you
The whiskey’s getting stronger, girl

Oh I can’t get enough of you

Namesake to Elisabeth
Her daddy's pride and joy
Baptised in her mama's tears soon after she was born
Cause the doctor said she'd never live to see her sweet 16
It's a miracle she beat those odds
And there's still no promise she will see tomorrow

It makes me wonder
How life can give someone so much
And take so much away
Oooh, yeah

Elisabeth
You're a teacher
You are safe
And I'm so glad you came to us
Elisabeth
You make the world a better place
With the kindness of your smile and your love
And your beauty with live on
And on

Elisabeth
Elisabeth
She might not ever marry
Or hold a baby of her own
Things we all take for granted
All the things she may never know

But she believes there's always hope
And that's all she really has
So she walks through life with passion
And with dignity and class

And when she cries
She cries in silence
But never for herself
She cries for everybody else
Everybody else

Elisabeth
You're a teacher
You are safe
And I'm so glad you came to us
Elisabeth
You make the world a better place
With the kindness of your smile and your love
And your beauty with live on
And on

Elisabeth
You're a teacher
You are safe
And I'm so glad you came to us
Elisabeth
You make the world a better place
With the kindness of your smile and your love
And your beauty with live on
And on


I can feel it coming on now
As the music plays
Taking shots with the night owls
As the world just fades away
Got a paycheck in my pocket
'Bout to get it all gone
Light it up like a rocket
We're going all night long


Everybody sing ooh, mmm
I love it when you ooh


When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
When I take you by the hand, dancin’
And we pass it around, ‘round, ‘round
We're so high, we could paint the sky
Tear the top right off the ceiling
And I swear we're never, ever coming down
Never coming down


Oh, oh, ooh yeah
Tell me now, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never, ever, never coming down


Well the band's on fire
And the beer is ice cold
We're going down to the wire
Then we'll all go rolling home
And maybe we'll keep it going
'Til we see that sun
Coming up right here, right now
I wanna see you move and hear you sing it out loud


Ooh


When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
When I take you by the hand, dancin’
And we pass it around, ‘round, ‘round
We're so high, we could paint the sky
Tear the top right off the ceiling
And I swear we're never, ever coming down
Never coming down


Oh, oh, ooh yeah
Tell me now, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never, ever, never coming down
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
Tell me now, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never coming down


Dance, baby, dance, baby
Don't stop now
Dance, baby, dance, baby
Don't stop now
I said oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now
Dance, baby, dance, baby
I said oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now
Wait a minute, baby, tell me one more time
She said oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now
Dance, baby, dance, baby
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now


When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
When I take you by the hand, dancin’
And we pass it around, ‘round, ‘round
We're so high, we could paint the sky
With the love right now, we feel it
And I swear we're never, ever coming down
Never coming down
Never coming down


Oh, oh, ooh yeah
Tell me now, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never coming down
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
Tell me now, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never coming down


It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, until the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten


It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, "You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides"
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive


Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal


It was just an old hand me down Ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive


I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say


It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain


When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
It's just an old plywood boat
With a 75 johnson
And electric choke


There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
And I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference between whiskey and you


Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that's somethin' I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you


One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you


I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference between whiskey and you


One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder, oh, if they ain't both the same
One's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you


Aww, that's the difference between whiskey and you


Yeah, I grew up ten minutes from the sticks
Ten minutes from the beach
And there ain't a Bible verse, y'all
I ain't heard a preacher preach
Mom and Dad up in the bleachers
Screaming while I pitch
Beating deep on the speakers
Finally riding around the town
With my best friends, ain't life like a whirlwind
One second I'm playing checkers with Grandma
Then my world ends
I used to hear my granddaddy say
Before it's too late


You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun goes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots
(You dig, you love, you gotta put 'em in the ground for someone)


Yeah, I'm a long haired, tattooed, feather in the wind
Yeah, a good ol' boy, just like my old man
Every night when I'm singing
I know he's looking down
Up there next to PawPaw
Got the best seats in the house
When I close my eyes I can still hear him say
The same thing I'm gonna tell my kids


You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun goes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots


I'm so of proud of where I came from (It's every part of me)
This town is who I am (My name's on every street)
And the way I was raised up (Yeah, you best believe)
Made me a better man (Just like my daddy)
I'm proud of where I came from (It's every part of me)
And damn I love this land (My name's on every street)
And the way that I was raised up (Yeah, you best believe)
Made me a better man


You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun goes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots


You dig, you love, you gotta put 'em in the ground for someone
You dig, you love, you gotta put 'em in the ground for someone


Thought I saw you today
You were standing in the sun then you turned away


And I knew I couldn't be but my heart believed
Oh it seems like something everyday
How could you be so far away
When you're still here
When I need you you're not hard to find
You're still here
I can see you in my baby's eyes
And I laugh and cry
You're still here
At the dream last night
That you came to me on silver wings of light
I flew away with you in the painted sky
And I woke up wondering what was real
Is it what you see and touch or what you feel
Because you're still here
Oh you're everywhere we've ever been
You're still here
I heard you in a stranger's laugh
And I hunger on to hear your laugh again
Just once again


Oh
Thought I saw you today
You were standing in the sun then you turned away
Away

Bells will be ringing the sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing 'Silent Night'
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night

Friends and relations send salutation
As sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, Christmas, my dear
The time of year to be with the one you love

So, won't you tell me you'll never more roam?
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief, no pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again

Oh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief, no pain
And I'll be happy Christmas once again

We don't need the world outside, we've got all we need tonight
Love is Enough, oooh yeah yeah
Let 'em say what they wanna say, when you're holdin' me this way
Love is Enough
Everybody searchin' for a piece of mind, all they gotta do is look at you and I

Chorus:
Baby, just wait and see you can always count on me, When times getting tough
You're the reason that i'm livin' nothing that i wouldn't give
Love is Enough
May never have a lot of money, but it don't really matter honey
Love is Enough
Ain't it funny how 4 little letters, can hold it all together
Love is Enough
Even when we're old and gray, i'll be here and you can still hear me say

(chorus)
Long kisses and a tender touch, 2 hearts make a leap
What else do we need?
(chorus


Yeah girl, I just had me
One hell of a work week
It's been driving me crazy
Not enough of you baby
Yeah, and I been a-thinking
'Bout breaking in the weekend
Not doing any sleeping
So get in, let's take a ride


And baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
And there won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Getting down to some up all night


Now don't forget your flip-flops
We can stop by the quick stop
Get some jerky and a twelve pack
No telling when we'll be back
I got a cooler in the truck bed
A couple towels when we get wet
Cause you know we're gonna jump in
And take a little midnight swim


So baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
And there won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Getting down to some up all night


Come Monday, I'll be back to working and saving
But until then, yeah


Baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
And there won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Getting down to some up all night

Yeah, me and you, oh
Up all night, yeah


There's a ship out, on the ocean
At the mercy of the sea
It's been tossed about, lost and broken
Wandering aimlessly

And God somehow you know that ship, is me


'Cause there's a lighthouse, in a harbor
Shining faithfully
Pouring its light out, across the water
For this sinking soul to see

That someone out there still believes in me


On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end

When you come back to me again


There's a moment, that we all come to
In our own time, and our own space
Where all that we've done, we can undo
If our heart's, in the right place


On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end

And you come back to me again


And again I see, my yesterday's in front of me
Unfolding like a mystery, you're changin' all that is and used to be


On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end


When you come back to me again
When you come back to me again

You really dont know Exactly what you're doin to me, do you?
I try to play it cool but I'm a fool
Each time you look at me that way
Your way, what can I say
Boy you turn me on

Whoo

Smile
You got the kind of smile thats so perfectly indescribable
Eyes bluer than the bluest bluebird flying up in the bluest sky
No lie, that I am falling for


Every little thing about you
Every little thing that you do
Feels the way its supposed to
When you la-la-la love someone
Just the way that heaven made it
I just wanna celebrate it
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
And every little thing about you
Every little thing

Yeah-
Touch me and suddenly
I'm on a roller coaster ride a thrill a minute
Hang on to every word that ever rolls
So soft and sweetly from your lips
That kiss Your tenderness


Every little thing about you
Every little thing that you do
Feels the way its supposed to
When you la-la-la love someone
Just the way that heaven made it
I just wanna celebrate it
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
And every little thing about you
Every little thing

Its just like someone looked down at me, and they
Knew every little thing about me
Needed every little thing about you

Just the way that heaven made it
I just wanna celebrate it
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
And every little thing

Every little thing about you
Every little thing that you do
Feels the way its supposed to
When you la-la-la Love someone
Just the way that heaven made it (Oh)
I just wanna celebrate it (Yeah I do)
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
And every little thing about you


This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear


Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'


I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said "Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough"


Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'


Like you never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missing
Some days you're living

It'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear


Some days you start singin'
And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'
Got a heart full of grateful
For all you've been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'


Livin' like you'll never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missin'
Some days you're living
Some days you're living


Yeah I've iced down a few thousand beers in my day
To put down twice as many
No telling how many bonfires have lit up my face
If it ain't hundreds, it ain't any
I stood on this stage so many times
And watched all my friends
Have the time of your life
There's something in this spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up right...


Like we ain't ever
All been together
And tried to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good like we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever


This ain't the first time we've partied under these stars
Making a hangover
Well, this time I got a few more songs in this old guitar
For you to pull your baby closer
You pull your baby closer




There's something in this spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up right...
Let's do it up right...



You and me we had a pretty good thing
We were makin' plans, we were planning our dreams
Then you had to go and let her back in
Boy, you oughta know that's where the trouble begins

She don't love you, she's just pullin' your chain
Don't you know you're like her puppet on a string?

Now she's walkin' around, talk of the town, she just can't shut up
Oh, she's out there and she's a havin' her fun
Spendin' her time, wastin' mine, provin' that she has you
Well, the truth is she don't have to, she can have you, I'm done

She's the kinda girl that's a good for nothin'
Leaves a path of destruction everywhere that she goes
What you see in her, well I'll never know
She's the kinda trash you find beside of the road

She don't love you, she's just messin' your mind
And you snap back, no slack, right back to her every time

Now she's walkin' around, talk of the town, she just can't shut up
Oh, she's out there and she's a havin' her fun
Spendin' her time, wastin' mine, provin' that she has you
Well, the truth is she don't have to, she can have you, I'm done

Oh, you had to scratch that itch
You deserve what you get, yeah, you and that

Walkin' around, talk of the town, she just can't shut up
Oh, she's out there and she's a havin' her fun
Spendin' her time, wastin' mine, provin' that she has you
Well, the truth is she don't have to, she can have you, I'm done
Truth is she don't have to, she can have you, I'm done
The truth is she don't have to, she can have you, I'm done

You?re my first mornin? light
You?re a warm and tender night
You?re the peace that I cling to
In the dark

You?re a strong cup of coffee
An elegant glass of wine
The food that feeds my hungry soul
What I thirst for when I?m dry

All the good love you give me
So wild, so pure, so sweet, so right
Like a smooth rollin? river
Up against that blazin? sunset sky
You?re the dream that?s real
That?s why you?re my life

You?re my passion, you?re my home
You?re the hope that I hang on
You?re the wheels that keep us goin? through it all
You?re the second wind I always catch
When I got no breath left in me

All the good love you give me
So wild, so pure, so sweet, so right
Like a smooth rollin? river
Up against that blazin? sunset sky
You?re the dream that?s real
That?s why you?re my life

Your beauty leaves me silent
When I look into your eyes
You?re my life

All the good love you give me
So wild, so pure, so sweet, so right
Like a smooth rollin? river
Up against that blazin? sunset sky
You?re the dream that?s real
That?s why you?re my life
You?re my life, you're my life, you're my life


I woke up this morning
With this feeling inside me that I can't explain
Like a weight that I've carried been carried away, away
But I know something is coming
I don't know what it is
But I know it's amazing, you save me
My time is coming
And I'll find my way out of this longest drought


It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing I'm wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today
Feels like today


You treat life like a picture
But it's not a moment that's frozen in time
It's not going to wait 'til you make up your mind, at all
So while this storm is breaking
While there's light at the end of the tunnel
Keep running towards it
Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache
Soon this dam will break


It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing you're wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today
Feels like today
Oh, oh, oh oh oh

It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing I'm wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today (feels like feels like your life changes)
Feels like today (feels like, feels like your life changes)

It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing you're wishing
The last sacred blessing
Feels like today


Feels like
Feels like your life changes
Feels like
Feels like your life changes

Take it on back
Take it on back
Take it on back to where the grass is greener
Yeah
Huh, Alright

She was a south Georgia stunner
Hotter than hell in July
We tasted heaven that summer
Then said good-bye and I don't know why cause
We'd park down by the river
Steam up them windows real good
I Wish I could go back and see her
You know I would lord if I could

Take it on back
Take it on back
Take it on back to where the grass is greener
Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to when she and me were true believers
In love and all the things that come with it
Moonshine kisses, man I miss it
Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to the best I ever had
Take it on (take it on, take it on)
Take it on back

Yeah!
Well I wonder if she ever wonders
If I'm thinkin' 'bout her too
Cause I'm thinkin' I still love her
If she only knew all I wanna do

Is take it on back
Take it on back
Take it on back to where the grass is greener
Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to when she and me were true believers
In love and all the things that come with it
Moonshine kisses, man I miss it
Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to the best I ever had
Take it on (take it on, take it on)
Take it on back

Take it on back to the truck bed blanket
Holdin' that girl 'til the sun come up
Take it on back to our song and crank it
Turn it up loud I can see her now

Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to where the grass is greener
Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to when she and me were true believers
In love and all the things that come with it
Moonshine kisses, man I miss it

Back to the best I ever had

Whoa Yeah!
Take it on back
(Take it on back, take it on back, take it on back to where the grass is greener)
Take it on back
Take it on back


30,000 feet above
The city where I fell in love with you
And the fading concrete skyline
Brings an urban lullaby that still rings true
When I passed you on the street that day
Should've let that red scarf fly away
Like any chance I had of keeping you
Like the Northern wind blowing
Yeah, my lonely heart was frozen
Never knew I'd find a way to break yours, too


Where the wind blows babe
You can bet I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love


The city lights look like a country sky
Like staring at the stars turned upside down
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find it in your heart to stick around
I hate it had to end this way
Tomorrow is a brand new day
And the chances here at love are precious few
Someone's out there waiting
For a sweet good timing lady
To make you smile the way I always wanted to


Where the wind blows babe
You can bet I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love


So I will fly all night
Our memory's my lullaby
That love will not lie
If it is love done right
You'll be waiting on the other side
Arms open wide
If love do not lie
Lie
We can fly


Where the wind blows babe
You can bet I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love


My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

Daddy's belt, Momma's drapes
Standin' tall on the backyard shed
Lookin' cool in my superman cape
I told the neighborhood girl, said hey y'all watch this
My fate was a broken arm, my reward one big kiss
When daddy asked me why I did it
I made him laugh out loud when I told him
Cause the chicks dig it


Scars heal, glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made
Pain hurts, but only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
Cause the chicks dig it


Black top road, learner permit
Thought I was Earnhardt
Drivin' fast but I didn't see the ditch
Took out a mailbox, then a fence and then a barn
The police came and called my father
But I met the farmer's daughter
And when the judge asked me why I did it
He threw the book at me when I told him
Cause the chicks dig it




Just throw caution to the wind, my friend
Then sit back and watch your life begin, cause




Scars heal, glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made
Pain hurts, but only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
It don't matter if you lose or if you win it
Hey the chicks dig it
The chicks dig it (x3)


They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far


'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen


So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon


When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen


So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said


I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen


We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me

Verse1
She dresses up her children and herds them to the car, drives down to the mega-church and can't find a place to park. Then
She feels a little guilty when she takes his name in vein, so she folds her last two dollars and she drops them in the plate
Its morning Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America

Verse2
His back is out of kilter from sleepin on concrete and he'd like to have some breakfast but he'll trade it for a drink
Those early morning joggers their quick to pass him by and the ones that drop a dollar don't they don't dare look him in the
Eye. Another Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America. Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America

Chorus:
Smell the eggs and bacon, hear the church bells ring, cheerleaders shakin on a big screen tv, there's Winnebago's and boats
On the lake and a red head, freckled face blows out the candles on his birthday cake. Sunday morning, Sunday morning in
America

Verse3
He's hunkered in a bunker with a rifle in his hand, layin his life on the line for every inch of sand. He dreamin about
That freedom that he's been fightin for and the arms that will wrap around him when he comes walkin through that door, some
Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America. Yea Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America

Chorus:
Smell the eggs and bacon, hear the church bells ring, cheerleaders shakin on a big screen tv, there's Winnebago's and boats
On the lake and a red head, freckled face blows out the candles on his birthday cake. Sunday morning, Sunday morning in
America. Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America

Bridge
Now I know it ain't perfect, there's a lot of things wrong in America, I thank God for those who layed down their lives to
Call this place my home

Chorus 2:
Smell the eggs and bacon, hear the church bells ring, cheerleaders shakin on a 57 inch big screen tv, there's trucks on the
Highway and sail boats on the lake and a red head, freckled face blows out the candles on his birthday cake. Sunday morning


I wish I could take a cab down to the creek
And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
Smoke and drink once in a while
Somehow it’d be good for me
I want a cool chick that’ll cook for me
But’ll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
And do what I want when I want
And she’ll do it with me


I don’t need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don’t need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na


Now I don’t need a garage full of cars
But I’ll take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And I’ll smoke ‘em nice and slow
Like they were good for me
Don’t need a ranch or a big piece of land
But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
A big ole couch in a big ol' room
Still feels lonely when it’s just you
Yes it does


I don’t need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don’t need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na


A little bit of everything
Under the sun
So, when I kick back basking in it
I’ll be okay with what I’ve done
Still having fun


I don’t need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don’t need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na

Oh, the twentieth century wasn't all that bad
It was a time like no one else has ever had
We learned to drive, we learned to fly
We sent a man into the sky
When he walked on the moon, we were so glad
Yeah, the twentieth century wasn't all that bad

Yeah, the twentieth century was quite a ride
We had to learn to see the other side
We had demonstrations and liberations
Great depressions and good vibrations
And doors that once were closed were opened wide
Oh, the twentieth century was quite a ride

We had movin' pictures and radio
And Broadway, country, rock and roll
In 1900, who'd a bet we'd all be surfing on the internet

Yeah, the twentieth century was a heck of a show
We all had our fifteen minutes, don't you know
Assembly lines, celebrities
The spotlight shined on you and me
And everybody got a standin' O
Yeah, the twentieth century was a heck of a show

From blocks of ice to air-condition
Telegraph to television
In 1900, who'd a known we all wind up with pocket phones

The twentieth century wasn't all that long
Just a hundred years has come and gone
We can't go back even if we try
So I'll just smile and wave goodbye
To see it leavin' makes me kinda sad
It was a time like no one else has ever had
Oh, the twentieth century wasn't all that bad

The twentieth century
Bye-bye

The twentieth century
Goodbye...

So she can't go out tonight again
Her sister's sick
She's gotta baby-sit
Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good excuse
Now you didn't hear any of this from me
But things aren't always what they seem
Brace yourself
This may come as a shock to you

Girls lie, too
We don't care how much money you make
What you drive or what you weigh
Size don't matter anyway
Girls lie, too
Don't think you're the only ones
Who bend it, break it, stretch it some
We learn from you
Girls lie, too

We can't wait to hear about your round of golf
We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall
And we like Hooters for their hotwings too
Other guys never cross our minds
We don't wonder what it might be like
How could it be any better than it is with you

Yeah, girls lie, too
We always forgive and forget
The cards and flowers you never sent
Will never be brought up again
Girls lie, too

Old gray sweatpants turn us on
We like your friends and we love your mom
And that's the truth
Girls lie, too
Yeah that's the truth
Girls lie, too

No, we don't care how much hair you have
Yeah, that looks good
Comb it over like that

For You
(Jim Brown / Liz Hengber)
You could call me anytime and Id come running
Id go to hell and back to rescue you
Id give up my soul and everything I own
If thats what you want, Id do that for you

Chorus:
Oh but now youre asking too much
You want me to find somebody new
Oh I never thought Id say this
But girl, congratulations
You found the one thing I cant do for you
Ask me for forgiveness, girl youve got it
If you dont love me what else can I do
If this really is the end you wont see my face again
If thats what you want, Id do that for you
Chorus
Youll have to think of something else
Cause theres no way to turn it off
Im sorry girl, I cant fall out of love
Oh I never thought Id say this
But girl, congratulations
You found the one thing I cant do for you
You found the one thing I cant do for you


My baby knows me better than I do
Funny how a woman has that over a man
I can do anything with her here beside me
Leaning on her is where I make my stand


Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone


My daddy was a wild one when he was younger
Everybody told my mama he'd be hard to tame
Full of himself he said 'sir' to nobody
But you oughta see him come a runnin' when mama calls his name


Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone


A man goes crazy trying to catch his feelings
Too much pride or maybe the words come out wrong
But that's okay 'cause he's still her hero
Steady as a rock, her love keeps rolling along


Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone


Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone


Pop a top, again
I just got time for one more round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone;
And you can let some other fool sit down


I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I tried to smile, and did a while; but it felt so outta place
Did you ever hear of a clown with tear drops streaming down his face?


Pop a top, again
I think I'll have another round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down


Home for me, is misery, and here I'm wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me. It's not what I perfer
So, it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her


Pop a top, again
I think I'll have another round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down
Pop a top, again


Just a bunch of poor boys, daddy's girls
Children of the corn field
Tryna turn a shift job into a dollar bill
We wear them muddy boots
Stay true to how we're raised
Ain't nothin' bout us fake


You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer


Just a bunch of John Deere junkies
Gettin' funky to some old Hank
Nothin' been stuck in the mud that we can't
Hook up to a rusty chain in the summer or in the rain
Yeah, it's a kind of thing


You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer


You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer


Well, all the parties on the streets are talking
Store front mannequins sleeping in lights
We used to smoke while we were jaywalking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kind of style
But boy you know it's been a while


I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round, round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore


I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh uh
But you ain't getting uh uh
If you don't come pick me up, damn
Show me off, wow
You might be tired, but I'm not


I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round, round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore


Yeah I don't know why you don't take me downtown
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
I just don't get it

Hang up that red dress
Let down your hair
Cancel those reservations
Don't need to go no where
As good as your looking right now
Girl bet your thinkin I'm crazy
There's a side of you that I wanna see
That never ceases to amaze me

Gimme that girl with the hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
Thats the you that I like best
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl lovin up on me
Old t-shirt and a pair of jeans
Thats the you I wanna see
Gimme that girl, gimme that girl

Gimme the girl thats beautiful
Without a trace of makeup of on
Barefoot in the kitchen
Singing her favorite song
Dancing around like a fool
Starring in her own little show
Gimme the girl the rest of the world
Ain't lucky enough to know

Gimme that girl with the hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
Thats the you that I like best
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl lovin up on me
Old t-shirt and a pair of jeans
Thats the you I wanna see
Gimme that girl, gimme that girl

I've seen the Joshua Tree
Got down on my knees
To the Virgin Mother, I prayed
I've walked glass barefooted
Strolled 'cross the devil's hot coal
I've tried everything, I swear

With a crucifix through her bedroom wall

I said hey (hey) what can I say?

I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves
I keep my lamp lit, to warn the sailors on their way
I'll tell a story, paint you a picture from my past
I was so happy, but joy in this life seldom lasts


I had a keeper, he helped me warn the ships at sea
We had grown closer, 'till his joy meant everything to me
And he was to marry, a girl who shone with beauty and light
And they loved each other
And with me watched the sunsets into night


And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to the sea
And the winds that blow remind me
Of what has been, and what can never be


She'd had to leave us, my keeper he prayed for a safe return
But when the night came
The weather to a raging storm had turned
He watched her ship fight
But in vain against the wild and terrible wind
In me so helpless, as dashed against the rock she met her end


And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to sea
And the winds that blow remind me
Of what has been, and what can never be


Then on the next day, my keeper found her washed up on the shore
He kissed her cold face
That they'd be together soon he swore
I saw him crying, watched as he buried her in the sand
And then he climbed my tower, and off the edge of me he ran


And the waves crash around me, the sand slips out to sea
And the winds that blow remind me
Of what has been, and what can never be


I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves
And though I'm empty, I still warn the sailors on their way


You're my forever, my slice of heaven
On this side of the Mississippi River, baby
You're my infinity, no end to you and me
Come hell, fire, or rain, baby, nothin' can change it
No, nothin' can change it


Ooh, when the good Lord calls me home and this life is through
I may be six feet deep, but I'll still be lovin' you
Baby, what we got won't ever die
Can't take diamonds, can't take gold
But I'll take your love with me when I go
I'm gonna take it to the grave with me


You're my destiny, you'll always be with me
Today, tomorrow, all the way to eternity, baby
No last breathe taken on this earth
No concrete tombstone, no amount of dirt can change it
No, nothin' can change it


Ooh, when the good Lord calls me home and this life is through
I may be six feet deep, but I'll still be lovin' you
Baby, what we got won't ever die
Can't take diamonds, can't take gold
But I'll take your love with me when I go
I'm gonna take it to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave, to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave, to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave, to the grave with me


You're my forever, my slice of heaven
On this side of the Mississippi River, baby


Ooh, when the good Lord calls me home and this life is through
I may be six feet deep, but I'll still be lovin' you
Baby, what we got won't ever die
Can't take diamonds, can't take gold
But I'll take your love with me when I go
I'm gonna take it to the grave with me


We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down the coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes come to think
I miss them all
And damn babe, it's all your fault


No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you


Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room


No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you


Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no I didn't care
Cause baby you were there
And once again
Couldn't help but stare


No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you


Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah you guessed it girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you


Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you


There's a cold feeling
Running up and down my spine
It seems to say "we're just wasting time"
Its like a bad movie
One I wish I'd never seen
The plot gets old, do you know what i mean?
Don’t try to tell me it isn't what it is


I'm good
I'm good at seeing the signs
I'm good at reading between the lines
No use in hanging on
Because you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone


On a lost highway
I don't know how I got where I am
Take the next splitsville exit ramp
It's like a cheap vacation
One I thought we planned very well
Now we've checked out the lovely love hotel
Don’t try to tell me it isn’t what it is


I'm good
I'm good at seeing the signs
I'm good at reading between the lines
No use in hanging on
Because you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone

Lord it's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar
Where do we take it from here?
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
It's been the same way for years
We made the change
Somebody told us when we came to Nashville
Boys, you really got it made
Old Hank made it here, we're all sure that you will
But I don't think Hank done it this way
I don't think Hank done it this way, no
Been years on the road, working one night stands
Speeding my young life away
Yeah, tell me one more time just so's I understand
Are you sure Hank done it this way?
Did ol' Hank really do it this way?
Yeah, I've seen the world with a four-piece band
Looking sideways at me
Singing our songs, one of his now and then
But I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way
No, I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way, yeah
No, I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way
Yeah, I don't think Hank done it this a'way

I'm doin' seventy-two in a sixty-five
On I-24 in a four-wheel drive
Got a ten o'clock on Eighteenth Avenue

And there's a thirty percent chance of rain all week
And the high today is gonna be eighty-three
They're playing Highway 101 on 102.5
An eighteen wheeler by my side

Numbers all around, flying by, up and down
Some as slow as Christmas coming
Some like the speed of sound
And we all wonder, what they mean
The highs, the lows, the in betweens
Most of them mean absolutely nothing
But some of them mean everything

I met her at 9:15 on my buddy's back porch
Shootin' bottle rockets on July fourth
We were both nineteen and she was a perfect 10

Then three years later 'neath a million stars
In my F-150 on her granddad's farm
I slipped a half-carat diamond on the third finger, of her left hand
And asked to be her one and only man

Numbers all around, flying by, up and down
Some as slow as Christmas coming

Some like the speed of sound
And we all wonder, what they mean
The highs, the lows, the in betweens
Most of them mean absolutely nothing
But some of them mean everything

John 3:16, the Fab four
The fifty yard line, the thirteenth floor
9/11, the dirty dozen
We're all waiting on the Second Coming

Numbers all around, flying by, up and down
Some as slow as Christmas coming
Some like the speed of sound
And we all wonder, what they mean
The highs, the lows, the in betweens
Most of them mean absolutely nothing
Oh most of them mean absolutely nothing
But some of them mean everything
Oh numbers

I'm doin' seventy-two in a sixty-five
On I-24 in a four-wheel drive
Got a ten o'clock on Eighteenth Avenue

Outside the courthouse on 5th and vine
There's a hundred people holdin' up their homemade signs
They say they'll be there sunshine or rain
'Till somebody listens, 'till somethin's changed

Believers
Believers
They got a little more faith than the world has doubt
The earth might shake, but they stand their ground
And God only knows where we'd be without
Believers

They were a couple o' kids with cheep wedding bands
They didn't have nothin' but big ole plans
Thirty five years later, they're still goin' strong
Aw, but they're not surprised, they knew it all along

Believers
Believers
They got a little more faith than the world has doubt
The earth might shake, but they stand their ground
And God only knows where we'd be without
Believers

Eighty nine years old and a momma still prays
That her wayward son will find his way
There's a telephone call that makes her cry
Its her son sayin' momma I've seen the light
Aww, everybody told her she was wastin' her time

Believers
Believers
They got a little more faith than the world has doubt
The earth might shake, but they stand their ground
And only God knows where we'd be without
Without believers

Hmm, Believers

After every day-after-Thanksgiving sale
The malls just ain't complete
Without a bunch of decorations
And a paper angel tree

There's artificial smiles
On artificial tree limbs
Saying what she'd love to have
And what to buy for him

Well, I hope Maggie likes her new winter clothes
And her buggy with a baby doll
And maybe Tom'll smile in his new Nike shoes
When he shoots that basketball

I can't help but wishing
That I could do more
But not just while I'm shopping
In the department store

Chorus:
Paper angels you're in my thoughts and prayers
No matter where you are right now
Remember God's right there
He's asking all of us to help take care
Of his paper angels everywhere

Going through the mail almost every afternoon
I see a Mom and Dad's worst dream
There on the back of a money-saving ad
To get my carpet cleaned

Height, weight, hair, eyes
Date missing, and D.O.B
A child's name, a picture
And the words 'Have you seen me?'

Chorus:
Paper angels you're in my thoughts and prayers
No matter where you are right now
Remember God's right there
He's asking all of us to help take care
Of his paper angels everywhere

His documented bruises
Fill a folder in a file
She's a second grade self-portrait
Drawn without a smile

And every town is littered
With this kind of debris
We've got to stop this madness
It's up to you and me

Chorus:
Paper angels you're in my thoughts and prayers
No matter where you are right now
Remember God's right there
He's asking all of us to help take care
Of his paper angels everywhere

Paper angels everywhere...

I threw that frame against the wall
Washed my hands of all the pieces
I poured another glass
And I asked myself again
What did I do to deserve this?
I started pacing back and forth
Conjured up a hundred reasons
But here I am again, running from the truth
Cause I can't start believing

What if it's me.... causing this heartache
Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks
Me.... Suing Myself, calling it the hand I'm dealt
I'm sure that it's her
But what if it's me...

What if it's me....
My own worst enemy
Not giving her enough attention
Ignoring all the little things
Now I lie here all alone, getting lost in her prediction

What if it's me.... causing this heartache
Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks
Me.... Suing myself, calling it the hand I'm dealt
I'm sure that it's her
But what if it's me...

And my selfish ways.. Me...
The one who needs to change.. Me....
Who needs to take the blame
For doing this to us

What if it's me.... causing this heartache
Blaming everybody else for the bad break
What if it's me causing this heartache
Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks
Me.... Suing myself, calling it the hand I'm dealt
I'm sure that it's her
But what if it's me...

What if it's me...
What if it's me...
What if it's me...
What if it's me...


I'm a little more beer bottle beer joint than a fancy bar
I'm a little more sitting up high on the road than a little car
I'm a little more bust ya back than take it for free
And that’s how I'll always be
I'm a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree
And that's how I'll always be


I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be


I got friends that say I live a little like Cool Hand Luke
Fast cars and motorcycles, raisin' hell in cowboy boots
But, hey, on Sunday morning, I'll take the back row seat
That's how I'll always be


I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be


I'm a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin' down
Handshake deals, fresh-cut hay fields, and hometowns


I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be


6lbs and 9oz. looking up at me
Like I have all the answers
I hope I have the ones you need
I've never really done this
Now I know what scared is

Sometimes I'll protect you from everything that's wrong
Other times I'll let you just find out on your own
But that's when you'll be growing
And the whole time I'll be knowing


You're going to fly with every dream you chase
You're going to cry
But know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair
But if you hang in there
You're going to see that sometimes bad is good

We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
You're going to be


I'm afraid you'll have to suffer through
Some of my mistakes
Lord knows I'll be trying
Oh, to give you what it takes
What it takes to know the difference
Between getting by and living

Because anything worth doing is worth doing all the way
Just know you'll have to live with all
The choices that you make
So make sure you're always giving way
More than you're taking


You're going to fly with every dream you chase
You're going to cry
But know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair
But if you hang in there
You're going to see that sometimes bad is good

We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
You're going to be


Someone's everything
You're going to see
Just what you are to me


You're going to fly with every dream you chase
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
You're going to be
Always loved by me


Girl I finally got you up in the seat of my old truck
And I bet you're wonderin' what we're gonna do
We could hit the county line, hell we do that all the time
Tell you what if you don't mind, we could start with something new
Instead of waiting like we usually do


It started with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
It started with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
It started with a goodnight kiss


I know that you told all your friends we were meetin' up with them
I can call 'em all again and tell them we ain't coming
Let me find a little spot, let me throw this thing in park
Let me light that little spark that gets you going like you do
Just tell me that you want to


It started with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
It started with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
It started with a goodnight kiss
It started with a goodnight kiss


I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
It started with a goodnight kiss
My lips, your lips


It started with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
It started with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
It started with a goodnight kiss
It started with a goodnight kiss


I don't wanna wait, no I don't wanna wait
